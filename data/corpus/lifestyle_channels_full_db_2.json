        "transcript": " Summer is definitely the most difficult season to build interesting outfits. For the most part, layering is almost completely out the window, unless you're adding a little wife lover, which means that the only thing you have left to add some spice to your outfits is your accessories, which is why in today's video, I'll be showing you guys the best summer accessories as well as daily carry items to elevate your summer fits this year. As always, everything you guys see in today's video will be linked in the description below. Starting off with the rope, not bracelet. But when I think of a summer accessory, this is exactly what I think about. The rope bracelet is the perfect accessory to add some visual interest to your wrist. I personally love to stack these with my other bracelets or with my watch. And you can find these in almost virtually any color, so you'll always be able to find something that can match the color that you typically wear in the summertime. But be very careful with spending too much money on these, because ultimately it's a fucking rope with a little bit of gold or silver on it, so don't overspend on this. Now if you're a little gay like me, you spend a little bit too many nights with the boys, You might want to get yourself some chain or cuff bracelets. I personally think a nice thin, minimal, some might say dainty bracelets look really, really clean and elegant, especially once you get a tan. As you can see, I don't currently have a tan yet, but once you have a tan, these accessories are going to pop like crazy. It was really interesting and I'm being 100% honest. I'd love to bullshit you and say that my outfits have gotten me the most compliments from women. The most compliments have come from my bracelets. Like this week alone, I've had five women comment on my bracelets. I never get that many compliments on my outfits. It's mainly the dudes. Next, since we all wanna be looking like Daniel Craig coming out of the ocean this summer, look at its face, idiot. Jeez. Second time you guys didn't realize? I guess I just thought it was way funnier than it was. If you watched the last video, you guys would know why I brought that up again. But you need a good pair of swim trunks, not just any pair of swim trunks, side adjuster swim trunks. That's right boys. We're now bringing side adjuster pants to the ocean. Personally think the side adjuster shorts just look so much better, so much more mature, cleaner. It looks a whole lot better than having a 20 foot string hanging from your shorts. And the biggest benefit about these types of shorts, specifically if you're gonna get it in a neutral color, you can wear it straight from the beach, straight to dinner, straight to the bar. It looks like a regular pair of pants. Nobody's gonna be like, hey, you got that. You can wear it to a nice restaurant. That being said, I personally do think you should also have a crazy colored hair of swim drugs, which I also got right here for the times that you don't care about where you're going after. Moving on to accessory number four, which is the canvas tote bag, but not to style it. Like you see some of these guys doing like, oh, I'm going to the coffee shop with the canvas tote bag. No, we're gonna be using this for its purpose, which is to take it to the beach or to the lake, to put your towels, your sunscreen, your water balls, et cetera, inside. The purpose of the canvas is to keep it cool. You don't wanna be bringing a leather bag to the beach because it's just going to get fried and destroy the leather, and it's also just going to heat up whatever you have inside. So ideally, with your canvas bag, you go for something that's a lighter color, maybe a bright blue like this, the cost one that I got, or whites, whatever you like, but just go for a brighter, lighter color. Next, one of the perfect pieces of clothing a man can wear this summer is the perfect fitted t-shirt. Like the ones from today's video sponsor, Unbound Marina. If you guys had already watched my summer video, you would have already seen how perfect these t-shirts are. The fit is incredible. The shirt stops at the perfect length. It's also made from merino wool, so you get this beautiful, soft texture that gives the t-shirt a really nice high-end look. And contrary to what you think, because it's merino wool, it's actually very cool. It's breathable, it has moisture-wicking capabilities, and it also has antibacterial properties. And funny enough, I'm actually leaving for Hawaii today, and I have three of these t-shirts packed into my bag, and the nice thing about them is that you can wear them for multiple different outfits, and they don't wrinkle easily at all. It's unlike my linen clothing, where I'm spent 20 minutes trying to derinkle it. These t-shirts just come out perfectly fine. So if you guys have been looking for a high-quality t-shirt with the perfect fit, check out my Marino. I'll leave a link to them in the description below. Now accessory number five is card holders. If you're going to the beach, you definitely don't want to have a brick of a wallet in your pants. You want something that is slim, that's small, that's stylish. I personally like to go with colored card holders to match the summer vibe, but it's totally up to you. I found these two from Essence for like half the price they usually go for. Super good deal on these two. I'll leave a bunch of really nice ones in the description below as well for you to choose from. Moving on to the summer footwear item. Everybody needs a stylish thong in their life, specifically a nice skinny thong. Now you want a nice leather sandal, something that you can wear to dinner in Greece or at a wedding. As for styles that I think look absolutely incredible, you have these X pattern sandals, like this one from Suit Supply. You also have the double buckle, which you'll typically see on Birkenstocks, which also look quite good. Or you could go for something that I recently picked up, which is the Gladiator 2000s. What the? Ah! These are gonna take some time for you guys to get used to, I'm sure. I actually like them. I think the key with these to get them in suede. I think maybe the leather ones look a little bit goofier and a little bit more difficult to style. But the suede ones, they're soft and I think they suit the summer vibe pretty well. But either or, you're gonna need one of these for your more dressier occasions. Next, because the boys like to get a little slutty in the summertime, get a little boob slip here and there. You definitely want a pendant necklace in the middle of your chest to add some visual interest, especially when you're out at the beach and all you're wearing is swim trunks. There are literally so many designs to choose from so it's hard for me to just choose some for you guys because it really comes down to personal preference but the key is to go with something that is smaller that's minimal you don't want to be looking like you just won the gold medal at the Olympics that's the key so boys I'm off to Hawaii now I will catch you guys in the next video if you enjoyed today's video please leave your boy a beautiful sweet message for the algorithm and I'll like and I'll catch you boys in the next video"

        "transcript": " Summer is among us boys and if you want to look like Daniel Craig walking up the ocean this year, well, you're in the wrong place because we don't wear shorts here, first of all. But if you did come looking for the absolute perfect 2025 summer wardrobe with the exclusion of shorts, that's exactly what you're gonna get. For your reference, I'm 5'8\", I'm 150 pounds of and I'm wearing as small in all my tops and as always all the links to everything that you see in today's videos as well as the alternatives will be in the description below. And just so you So you guys know if you see this patch on my arm, this is road rash, I fell doing some stunting on my motorcycle. This is not a heroin track mark guys. I haven't been absent because I've been doing heroin. So, starting with our lower garments. I did include some shorts because if I didn't I would be stoned to death in the comments. So if you are a shorts wear, the perfect shorts for the summer is the linen drawstring shorts. Abercrombie has an absolutely amazing selection of different colors to choose from. These are nice and lightweight, they're a bit airy, they have a bit more room, so if you're going to style these, I would typically lean towards a more relaxed outfit above, so that you have a cohesive look. Next, my preferred choice, the linen pants. There's two styles of linen pants I personally like to have in my rotation for different aesthetics. If I'm going for a casual look, I'll wear something a little bit more loose with a drawstring like these Abercrombie linen polon pants. If I'm going for something slightly more dressed up, a little bit more formal, I'll tend to to rock a more tapered linen pant with some belt loops like these regular fit ones from Mango. Now in terms of colors, whatever your budget allows, honestly I try to pick up as many as you can. It's kind of the same with your linen shirts. You want to have as many colors as possible, but to most ideal colors to get white, black, and then maybe a beige or brown color. Now because linen really pisses me off when I'm traveling due to the fact that it wrinkles so easily and it is so unbelievably difficult to derinkle it, I always like to have an alternative to linen pants And these ones from Mango are this wool slash polyester blend. It just feels unbelievable, super lightweight. It flows so well and you don't have to worry about the wrinkles, so I really like to have. These is an option for travel, but they're very difficult to come across. This is the only pair that I found in like years since I bought these gray ones that I used to have from Zara, which I love. I guarantee you, sold out now. I just sold them out with that pitch right there. Next, totally optional. If you have your linen trouser, feel free to skip this, but I personally always like to have a white chee-no in my rotation. It just gives you a little bit more versatility, plus you can never have too many white pants guys because they are gonna get fucked up every single year. As soon as a hot sauce bottle comes around, that's like, oh, my pants are destroyed once again. I just bought these, of course. Now moving up the body, the next thing you're gonna need is some nice fitted t-shirts. Now just because a fitted t-shirt is a basic, doesn't mean that your outfits are gonna look basic. I actually find that whenever I just wear a t-shirt with some minimal accessories and a trouser, I get a lot of compliments on my outfit. People are like, dude, you look like you just exited your company for a hundred million. I'm like, putty, I did. You didn't hear in the news? I'm rich. I studied, bro. But seriously, the right t-shirt with the right fit and quality can give you this clean, rich guy look for some reason. I'm not sure what it is, but it does. And there's two t-shirts that I recommend. Fantastic options. Banana Republic's Luxury Touch t-shirts are phenomenal. I mean, it says it in the name Luxury Touch and it does look like a luxury t-shirt and it's relatively affordable. Second one, if you're looking to invest a little bit more into your t-shirts. Once something that's gonna last you a bit longer. You have the Unbound Merino t-shirts. These are phenomenal, super comfortable, extremely breathable. I know it seems contradictive to be wearing a wool t-shirt in the summertime, but it actually keeps you very cool. It's antibacterial and the wool gives your t-shirt that even more premium look. Next, absolutely vital for your summer outfit is the lovely Wife Lover. These are going to be necessary for you to do layering with your summer fits. Ideally, you get two types. one that's thicker, that's higher quality. This is gonna be the one that you wear with your nice outfits, you can get these ones from Suit to Ply, Abercrombie, Banana Republic. Then your secondary one is going to be the one you don't give a shit about. This is the one you wear to the beach, you get sunscreen on, and you can just throw it out. And I suggest that you just buy it from Haynes, Tommy Hilfiger, or Calvin Klein. Ah, don't skip yet. This one's gonna be worthwhile, you'll find some pieces you like here. Quick shout out to today's video sponsor, Huckberry. Huckberry is a one stop shop for guys like us that appreciate style, quality, and adventure. They got a ton of different brands, so you really don't need to go anywhere else. It's all about high quality, curated selection. So whether you're looking for rugged outdoor gear, or you're just looking for everyday essentials that look clean, you'll definitely be able to find it here. And to prove it to you, I'm gonna show you guys what I personally picked up from their website. So first up, we have this green camp collar shirt. I know you guys absolutely love this one. It's got that thick, quality cotton feel, and the fit is just a chef's kiss. Then I also grabbed this in Merino quarter zip for those cooler spring days. It comes in this beautiful Heather Brown colorway and you can just tell it's really premium by the way that it feels. I also picked up this wash green long sleeve crew, which is absolutely perfect for casual spring outfits. And then this navy polo bro, come on, look at it. It's freaking beautiful. You can dress it up, you can dress it down, it can do anything. So whether you're building your wardrobe or you're just looking to upgrade those key pieces within your wardrobe, Huckberry's got you covered. If you guys are interested in any of these items, I'll link them in the description below as well as Huckberry's website. Let's get moving. Moving on to the summer staple, what people would believe is the summer staple is the linen shirts. Now these are a must for staying cool whilst still looking put together. Once again, just like our linen pants, I like to have two fits of these linen shirts. One that's regular or relaxed fit, something that you can wear with your more casual outfits. And then the secondary one is a slim fit one that you can wear to dinners or more formal occasions. Now if you're looking to add some visual interest without going overboard, you could also add a stripe to these linen shirts with a marker, no. You could go for something that's very subtle like this lightweight textured shirt from Banana Republic or you could go for the classic white and blue stripe linen shirt from a place like Massimo Dutti. Now moving into our more visually interesting tops, we have the button knit polos. Now personally with the button knit polo, either they like to go super bright with my color pattern or I like to add some crazy texture. So for my texture fiends, you can go for a bucle knit appearance like this one from Banana Republic. This thing looks sick. I know you guys really like this one. Or you could go for a more ribbed appearance like this navy one from Mango. You could even go for a crochet knit too if you like crochet from Abercrombie. Next, of course, we cannot forget about the classic sweater polo, which is probably what I'm known for these days. You can never go wrong with having a few plain ones because you can wear these in the spring, summer, and maybe even into fall, depending on what country you live in. But personally, again, with a lot of these things, I like to add some brighter colors or some subtle patterns into my clothes during the summertime. They had a bit more personality, slightly more retro. And then as we know, Abercrombie probably has the best selection when it comes to these style tops. All of these that you see are from Abercrombie. Next, for those more relaxed summer days or even holiday outfits, you can go with a cab color shirt. This is where you can definitely introduce a subtle pattern or so, because it kind of gives that resort vibe. Rock this with your wife lover underneath and you got a pretty fresh outfit, dude. Now for those late night shenanigans were a little bit too brisk to just wear a light layer You want to have a cotton Johnny collar long sleeve sweater that you can throw on I really really like this one from Tommy Hill Figure that striped it looks like I need to exit my company for 100 mil and buy myself a yacht haven't exited yet Sitting on 100 mil right now So I have to might have to make that exit soon or you could go for something a bit more simplistic like this French terry Polo in this beautiful green colorway from Banana Republic. So guys, that is all I have for you today. I hope you enjoyed the selection of items that I have in today's video. If you did enjoy this video, please smash the like button and drop me a comment for the algorithm because the M340i video did terribly. So please comment on this one so that we can push this one up. Thanks, boys. Appreciate you, and I'll catch you in the next video. See ya! What?"

        "transcript": " This is my BMW M3. Where'd he go? Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! Give it what they gave me! in one of my videos recently, if you guys were interested in seeing the mods that I've done to my car, let me know in the comment section below. And there was a lot of engagement. A lot of you guys wanted to see it. So that's what we're gonna do today, a little hand shot video vlog style. Let's get it. Bigger than myself but it's not enough. All right guys, here she is. This is my 2020 BMW M340i. This color option that you're looking at right here is called Dravik Gray. And what's really unique about Dravik Gray is you kind of get like two different colors. Right now on a beautiful sunny day, you get this gray with the gold flake inside. And then at nighttime or on an overcast day, you kind of get like a Nardo gray looking car, which is pretty insane. It's very exclusive to Dravik Gray, which is an individual color option. Now this car is not stock, it is on a Stage 2 MHD OTS tune. I've tuned it on 93 pump gas. So this car makes around 440 wheel horsepower. These cars stock make about 382 horsepower to the crank. BMW does underrate their numbers, so I'm not sure what the wheel horsepower is, but this is significantly faster. And for daily drivers, have 440 wheel horsepower all-wheel drive. This thing rips. You're pretty much gonna beat almost any car on the road right off the line. Oh. So it's plenty fast and fun. And it's extremely reliable with his B58 engine. Everybody talks about the B58 Dick riding, but the engine is nuts. So opening up the hood here, as I said, this car is tuned. So we do have a downpipe, but this is a cat-ed downpipe. It's an active auto works cat-ed downpipe. And the only reason I went with cat-ed was because initially I wasn't sure I was going to tune this car. I didn't know that there was Fentmo unlocks and all these other things, but luckily my car was a 2020 version. So I was able to use an MHD Unlocker and do it myself from home, which was really sick. I didn't have to rip out my DME and ship that off to Finland, whatever. So that's why I have that. It does sound fantastic still being a high flow catadown pipe and you do get the performance aspect of it. So that was good. I also have an MST cold air intake for those crazy turbo noises. It adds absolutely no performance whatsoever. Apparently it's worse than stock, but stock doesn't give you this crazy sound as you can hear right here. It's a lot of noise. So now for the aesthetic mods we are lowered very barely this is just a dyne in spring it lowered the car about an inch which is more than enough for a daily driver especially here if you guys live in Vancouver you know how messed up these roads can be I have gone through probably seven front lips so far so I'm not lowering this car anymore this is more than enough for here maybe if I to go to a place like Dubai that has absolutely perfect roads then I would slam the car but it's not here this is more than enough and it still gives you pretty decent aggressive stance. Now as for the front end of the car the one thing that changed this car the most and it's actually a mod I did recently is these headlights. Now these headlights are not stock these are Alibaba specials but the one thing that's really sick about these ones versus the other laser lights that you'll see is this is actually a blacked out housing. So as you guys can see, this is gloss black on the inside, which this headlight typically, the stock version of them, comes in silver, which doesn't look nearly as good as the blacked out housing. I also do have yellow DRLs, which you will not be able to see right now because the sun is just beaming the car, but I'll put some clips here so you guys can see. Super aggressive by far the best mod I've done. And if you guys are having M340 and you're interested in these, I'll leave the guys WhatsApp in the description so you can purchase if you have one. Like I said, front lip, I have gone through seven of these. I had a carbon one initially and I spent $1,000 on it within a week, not even maybe. It might've been two days, it was already broken and I'm like screw this, I'm just gonna buy $200 front lips from now on, so I'm not pissed every time it breaks. As for the kidney grill, this is one from BMW that I got installed, because initially it was the stock gold color, which I didn't really like too much. I'm also waiting on some side skirts right now. They should be here in the next week or so. I was really hoping I'd have them for the video, but it's fine It's not a big deal, but I will have some side skirts pretty soon Which will make the car pretty much complete done everything else now before we continue this video I wanted to share with you guys some beautiful backpacks from today's video sponsor grams 28 so grams 28 just dropped two Brand new luxury backpacks and trust me. They don't just look good. These are super high quality They're crafted with premium Italian leather, so they feel just as good as they look super sleek minimal and ridiculously practical This one here is the 150 Daypack. It's your go-to daily carry, clean professional business ready, perfect for when you're in a suit or you're dressed more mature and you don't wanna look like you're still in school. It fits a 16-inch laptop, has a fold-over opening, and it's even got a secret pocket for your business receipts. Then we've got the 151 Stealth backpack, which is ideal for creatives. It's got modular dividers for the camera gear, padded laptop sleeve, and all the pockets you could ever need, including a sneaky little one in the back here. As for my fellow travel people, We have the 152 transit backpack. This is the perfect one for you. It fully opens like a suitcase, comes with a free packing tube. It fits your laptop sunglasses. And basically everything this thing is your ideal carry-on. So whether you're commuting, you're creating, or you're traveling, Gramps 28 will have something for you if you guys are interested. You can use my code brandon20 to get 20% off. All your orders, the links will be in the description. Let's get back to our video. I've also done the mirror caps. These are the M-style mirror caps. So versus stock, basically just this little piece of plastic that's different, but that little piece of plastic makes a huge difference, I promise you. As for the wheel setup we have here, these are the Vossen HF-5s. I actually bought these second hand and this came off a C63. So I had to add some spacers because they were pretty far in and it's still not completely flush, but it's close enough. I'm already running a 20 mil up front, which is pretty big. So I don't wanna push it too much and have it like so far away from the wheel hub. So it's good enough. But these wheels are super sick. I think they look extremely aggressive. I'm actually debating right now. I'm not sure if I wanna send it or not, but the Apex VSR5s in the Motorsport gold, I think would look so, so nice with the Dravitt colorway because of the gold flake in the paint. I think it would just go so well if I had those gold wheels. But we'll see. I've spent quite a lot on this car already. You might just have to get an M3 instead. As for the rear end of the car, we have a carbon fiber duck tail. I used to have one that was enormous. It was like Mount Everest shooting off the back of my car. That was a big mistake. So I ended up getting this one, which is much more conservative. I think it looks a lot better. As for the diffuser, this is an M performance diffuser. Nothing special, but I added this little canard here, which makes a huge difference. Just like the wing of the mirror, this also makes a huge difference, even though it's such an insignificant piece and it's so small, made a huge difference. This is not a stock exhaust. This is an AWE Touring non-resignated exhaust. So this car actually sounds insane, as you can hear right here. And believe it or not, that is actually a completely stock verbal tune. I did not up the verbal tune in my MHD app. That is set on stock verbals. Before I even got the tune, it sounded like that because it is the 2020 version. BMW changed the emission thing with the newer cars so they don't sound as good, but the 2020 version had that in it already, as well as the option to tune it and not have to do a Fentmo unlock. So that's another benefit of getting a 2020. We also have some interior mods as well, which I'm gonna show you. So I have a custom steering wheel. This is a custom Alcantara and carbon fiber steering wheel. I've gone with the black and blue, which is basically the same color as the whole theme of the car. It's all black and blue. It's like the BMW logo. I've done the carbon fiber trim pieces everywhere. These are actually just overlays. They're not replacement parts. So this is just stuck on there with an adhesive. So I can take it off if I need to sell this car or whatever. I also did a blue push to start button as well. Just to complete the theme. So yeah guys, I didn't wanna go too hard on this car because it is not an M car. It's an M light car. I just wanted to go for an OEM plus look. Plus it is my daily, so I'm not gonna go too crazy with it and send it with like pure 800 turbos or do anything too nuts to this car. I want it to just be a daily driver that is reliable. And that is what it is. If you guys are interested in this car, it is absolutely fantastic. I don't know if I mentioned it earlier, but I've had no issues with this car and it's been tuned for about two years. No issues whatsoever, just regular maintenance. Your oil changes, your brakes, and this car will treat you very well. So, hope you guys enjoyed today's video. I know it's a little bit of a different one, but if you liked it, please drop a like and comment, and I will catch you boys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " Today I'll be helping you guys build your perfect spring slash summer shoe collection for 2025. As you can see I purchased a ridiculous amount of shoes and the pure reason for that is so I can give you guys multiple different price ranges so you can find something within your budget. I've also sneaked in some spring and summer clothing into this video so pay attention to the outfits that I'm wearing because these will also sell out. And as always everything including the alternatives to these shoes will be linked in the description below. So first up, a sneaker that's gained quite a lot of popularity recently. and I actually really like it, is the gum bottom sneaker. Now, the popularity of this shoe might be attributed to the Adidas Sambas, it might be attributed to the Mason Margielas, but either way, I'm here for it. So rather than just getting a plain white sneaker this year, I think a great alternative is a gum bottom sneaker, and these typically come with some suede on it, mixed with the leather and the gum, so you also get just like a more interesting looking shoe. So that being said, my first recommendation for your sneaker is the Mason Margiela Gat, is honestly extremely affordable, quality is perfect. Probably the best sneaker to get this, could you imagine? Would I be Brandon if I didn't find every single alternative on the planet to this shoe? So, starting with our most affordable alternative, we have these Pelig Bandwidth sneakers from Amazon. I probably butchered the way that it's spelled. Amazon always has these super weird names for some reason. I don't know why. Let me be crystal clear with this pair. It's going to be shit. Don't expect it to be exceptional quality. It is an Amazon sneaker, but if you're just looking to get the same look, you don't have much of a budget yet to buy any of the other sneakers. This is a great alternative. Another option that will be quite similar in quality to the Amazon ones, maybe slightly better, is the Dixxim White Leather Sneakers from Steve Madden. Now the next alternative where you can actually rely on the quality being a little bit better is the Adidas Samba OGs. Obviously it is not a completely identical shoe to the Myse Margella Gats, but it still gives you that kind of look and you're also not trying to pretend to be a different shoe. So it's obviously a great option. You also have the Puma Palmeros Leathers, which are also a great sneaker. That's not trying to be the Mason Margiela, but has that type of vibe. Sorry guys, I actually found more alternatives. Obviously this is a different day, but I wanted to include this in this video. I also found some BW Army shoes from Adidas. I didn't even realize that they had these, but they are very similar to the Mason Margiela Gats. And you can best believe that these are gonna be better than the Amazon version. So that's an option. We also have another option from Oliver Cabell. Apparently the quality is not as good as it once was, but it's still a good option for $250, whatever it is. Now this next alternative on the other hand is probably the best quality mason Margiela Gat alternative that is half the price made in Italy handcrafted, and that is this Garosso Hawns White. Now as you can see, it's almost identical, except it's missing that one suede stripe within the middle, which might be nicer for you. You get a more minimal sneaker. And the only other difference is that it doesn't have cream laces, but you can obviously, if you want cream laces, you can just buy them for $10 or $5 off the balance. Now the next shoe you're gonna want is a colored sneaker because in the spring and the summer time we get light to get a little flirtatious with our colors. As you can see, I'm wearing blue right now and that is one of the colors I like to wear in the spring and the summer as well as brown. So you best believe I got shoes to go with all of these colors. So we got a few different sneakers that all come in different types of silhouettes. They're all nice and they come with lots of different colorways as well. First up we have the Adidas Sambas in the Adidas handball specials, you can virtually find either of these two styles in any color way you want. I'm not even kidding. Adidas probably has a million colorways of every single one of these shoes. If you tend to dress a little bit more on the formal side like myself, I think the handball specials may be more your style. It's not to say that it's a formal shoe by any means, but it just has the shape of a more formal minimal sneaker. And then you have the Adidas Sambas, which is a great casual shoe. If you wanna be wearing denim in the summertime, it's a perfect option. Now moving into a slightly higher price bracket, We have these super sick Hugo Boss suede sneakers. These are unbelievably clean. I like them so much. I had to buy them in both the blue and the beige and I'm keeping both of these. It's got some subtle branding on the side here, but it's still extremely minimal sneaker. If you wanted to dress these up, wear them with some chinos, you definitely could. Another option that leans more casual has lots of colorways and is still in the same price range is from the brand called Aloha's. And their sneaker is called the TB490. Lots of different colorways on here, but they are like a pre-order website. you do have to wait a month before you get your shoes. Moving up a little bit more, we have the Accelerato Dice A sneaker. I'm a huge fan of this khaki colored one, but from this point on guys, I wouldn't really spend any more money because this is just your casual sneaker. So you shouldn't really be investing too heavily into this. Now, however, this next shoe, if you'd like to invest a little bit more heavily into, you definitely can. And that is our Suede sneaker. These are gonna be your Polo and trouser shoes. They're more minimal, little to no branding, a clean design and if you're not a fan of loafers, you can obviously wear these with your more formal outfits. So starting with our most friendly budget option, we have the Aldo Abot. As you can see, this is a slip-on sneaker. It gives you a much cleaner look. I'm a huge fan of these lace-less sneakers actually. Not the ones that don't have any laces, just the ones that don't actually have the ends that you have to tie. I think it looks so clean, super easy to slip on, slip off, and you still have the lace design. Next we have, which we already talked about, is the Hugo Boss suede sneakers. These can definitely work really well here as well. They're quite minimal and slim and also really decent quality. Now, if you like the stripe on the side of these Hugo Boss sneakers, but you don't want any branding whatsoever, you obviously have the calf suede sneakers from Suitsupply, which you guys have seen me wear frequently. Another great option within this price range, which I've never actually had my hands on before, but I've heard great things about it, and that is the Vega Bon 2.0 sneaker. Now, if you want some top of the line quality suede sneakers, best bang for your buck, We have the Coyo Capris. These are absolutely stunning. They have a large selection of different colorway options as well. And if you're not a fan of the slip on, slip off style, they also offer the Capri, which is the style with laces as well. Another great option for Italian handmade suede sneakers is Scoroso. You saw the Hans White earlier, the ones that look like the Mason Margiela Gats. They also have this beautiful tan suede or blue option in this sneaker as well. And then at the absolute max budget, we have the Common Projects Achilles, and these come in a few different color ways as well. Now, moving on to our favorite shoe, the Suede Lover. Who doesn't love a Suede Lover? It's literally the perfect shoe for the summer days. And because these all are gonna look almost exactly identical to each other, rather than talking about the way they look, I'm gonna focus on the higher quality Suede Lover. So starting with our budget option, I've had these previously. These are the Massimo Dutti Split Suede Lover. They do feel a bit firm. They're not quite as soft as some of the other options here, but they are still a great looking suede loafer. It does seem though that they have changed the sole color of these. It's not quite that translucent color anymore. So keep that in mind as well. And then also size down, I believe a half size, mine were too big. Next we have all reliable suit supply suede loafers. These will be still the best bang for your buck if you're within North America. And I say North America because there was a better option within Europe from the brand we've been talking about a lot in today's video, which is Skoroso. Now Skoroso has way more color options and Suit Supply does, they're virtually the same price and their suede is actually better. I've tried them on from one of my friends. I'm gonna buy one myself. Obviously you can still buy these if you're in North America you just might have to pay $30 or $40 duty fee which might be worth it because you actually can get different colors. I think Suit Supply only carries three different colors on their website. But if you're within Europe, 100% hands down Skoroso loafers are by far the best option for your budget. And then finally we have the daddy, basically the creator of this shoe which is the Loro Piana Summer Walks, way overrised, don't even buy these. It's not worth it. Next, moving into our beach footwear. Everybody needs a good sandal, well maybe two actually. One that you don't give a shit about. One you're gonna wear to the beach, you're gonna get sand on it, you're gonna get water on it. And then the other is your dressy sandal that you can wear on your vacation dinners. Obviously you don't need to go for an open-toe shoe option. You could just wear your very expensive suede loafers you bought instead. But if you want some open-toe shoe options, I'm gonna give you some. So when it comes to the beater sandals, I really don't think there's any better option than the Birkenstocks. I've had my Birkenstocks for like two, three years and I just beat the crap out of them and they still look fine. And if you get the right colorway with the right material in these, they can also look dressed up too. They kind of work as both. Now as for the dressy options, you have the Payden from Aldo. Kind of gives Hermes vibes a little bit. Super affordable. And another option from Aldo is the Marin if you're more of a fan of that crossover style. And one that I personally bought, I believe two years ago is the Steve Madden Mavens. These look great. I will say that they do hurt your feet if you go wear these for quite a long time, you go on a long walk. So only for short journeys you wear these. If you want something that's a little bit more premium, that's most likely not gonna hurt your feet. You have the Suit Supply Dark Brown Slipper, which is quite elegant. And then we also have the Ina Suede Sandal from Scoroso, which is basically the bougie Italian Birkenstock. So boys, I hope this video was helpful and you guys found some new footwear options for spring and summer. If you guys enjoyed today's video, Please drop your boy a comment and a like for the algorithm and I'll catch you in the next video. Say ya!"

        "transcript": " So ever since I did this writing followers outfit video last year, I've been needs spammed to this day in my DMs and in my emails asking for a part two. So boys, lucky for you. Your prayers have been answered. Daddy Brandon is here to roast and rank your outfits into a tier list. And today's tier list looks like this. At the top of the board, we have smash, meaning once again, if your outfit was a girl, cheeks would be getting clapped for real. Next, we have super clean, which just means your outfit is very well put together. much I would change I would wear this myself next category we have almost there which means you might be missing something that fit might be slightly off Maybe you want to change your shoes etc. And finally we have needs major improvement Which is just exactly what it sounds like and just a quick disclaimer before we get into the video as I said last time fashion is 100% subjective this is just my opinion, so please don't take anything I say seriously or get offended by anything and thank you to those actually sent their outfits forward for this video I appreciate you guys being good sports Let's get into this, it's gonna be pretty fun. Okay, so starting it off with a nice formal look. Wow, this is very well executed. I love the color choice. The blazer fits exceptionally well. Everything looks really high quality. The one thing that is throwing me off though is the brake that's in your trousers. Just because this is a trouser, ideally you want no brake, just for it to sit nice and straight. So just because that's very slight minuscule difference to your outfit, everything else looks great. We're gonna put you in the super clean section. Well done. Whoa, okay there buddy. Clearly the jaws are sized does work. Oh my god, jawline, my god. It's said to be so sharp that it can cut your eyes. Just look at it. Ow! Those actually get the reference. So apart from your immaculate jawline, the outfit actually looks really good. It's very similar colors to the previous guy. The fit from what I can tell you are sitting down. Looks pretty good. Everything works well together, dude. You got all your accessories. That is a super clean outfit. All right. Before we even look at the outfit, we gotta change the shades, buddy. I feel like if you're gonna wear those shades, you either have to be bald, you gotta have extremely long hair. I'm joking. The reason is, is just because it doesn't suit your face. You have a very oval face shape, and to be honest, these are also just way too big for your face, but the oval shape of those aviators doesn't do anything for your face. You want something that's a bit more angular. So now, looking at your outfit, your outfit is actually pretty good. There's not much that would change with it. Everything fits really well. I would change your sneakers for something a bit slimmer, just because the new balance pipe, that these are not really the slimmest sneaker to match your very beautifully tailored trousers. And then you're also missing your accessories. So you, my friend, are gonna be the first person to go into the almost there category. Very close though. Oh, okay, I see you, bro. Bro's trying to be humble in the DMs like he didn't just send me his cleanest fit. Damn, dude, that crocheted knit polo is something else. Where'd you get that from? I might have to cop that for myself, to be honest. This is immaculate, dude. The trousers, oh, you even matched the watch to the trouser, dude. Like a little tank or something like that. Some nice white sneakers, bro. Oof. Perfect. Well done. You are the first person going into this smash category, bro. This is clean. Well, well, well. I think we all know what I'm gonna say here. Steal your damn shirt, bro. Apart from your extremely wrinkled shirt, this outfit is exceptional. I love this color combination. For summer, you can never go wrong with a blue linen shirt with some cream or off white trousers and then these sand loafers. It's just such a clean look. You are missing some accessories. You got nothing on your wrist. I don't know if you've got even a chain on. So we're gonna put you into the almost there. It would have been a super clean if you just had some things on your wrist, but very well executed as well. Oh my days, would you look at that? He knew to send this outfit. He took my two favorite things, a cable knit sweater in brown, and then he's wearing some suit supply side adjuster trousers. That's a cheat move, you know? You can't do that. Smash, smash, smash. Smash! Yeah! Buddy's on his phone right now, calling his girlfriend. Big wake up, Brandon, just put me in smash category. You didn't ruin this fit with those sneakers. Come on. Dude, everything is so nice with this outfit. The over-shirt denim fits super well. I'm not even mad at the color of the sneakers. All of actually works. It's the fact that it is a runner. You never wear runners with anything athletic wear. Let's change these out for a nice suede minimal sneaker and all of that would have put you in a super clean, even maybe even a smash to be honest, but because we had the switch that out, you my friend are going into the almost there section. So close. Yo, hold up. Is that me? Now you're talking my language, bro. That is a smash for sure. Oh, I absolutely love everything about this fit. The Ralph Lauren Polo Bear sweater. You either love it or you hate it. I really love these. As you guys know, if you watch my spring outfits video, I just bought myself one of these as well. The pleated trousers fit exceptionally well. It is like the perfect width for it to go with that sweater. The white sneakers with the off white bottom and you got the watch, the accessories, and even the trench coat, dude, this is immaculate. Probably my favorite outfit so far for sure. Wow, dude, another great fit. The colors, this is an absolutely perfect fall, winter outfit. You guys know how much I love my brown. Those chestnut chelsea's are beautiful, dude. Another smash. I'm honestly super impressed. You guys don't even need me anymore at this point. Geez, they say that the student will eventually beat the master. That's what you guys seem to be doing. My man is rockin' Ralph Lauren head to toe. Dude, there's really nothing that I would change with your outfit. Everything looks really well fitted, proportional. Your colors work. The only thing I change is your belt to a brown belt. But to be honest, it doesn't really matter because you probably can't see it anyways unless you're sitting the way that you are. So this is super clean, dude. You were going into the super clean section. Well done. Okay, we got a nice summer outfit here. This whole fit head to toe is definitely Abercrombie. I know an Abercrombie polo in shorts when I see one. Maybe even the tank too. This is clean, dude. This is a very nice summer outfit. I would definitely rock this. I love the Birx too. We're definitely gonna be uploading those feet to feet. Finder by the way, I gotta make some money off this video somehow. Well done, dude, super clean. All right, before we move into our next victim, I just wanna say a big thank you to today's video sponsor ASUS. Because let's be honest, style isn't just about what you wear. It's also about the tools that you use every single day. And right now the Asus ZenBook A14 is just one of the sleekest, most portable AI plus laptops out right now. This laptop contains the new Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, so it's not only super fast, but it also has co-pilot plus AI built in, which means it can help you with loads of different tasks, like summarizing notes, generating ideas, and even help with editing while I'm on the go. And the crazy part about this laptop is it actually weighs under 1kg. This is officially the lightest laptop I've ever held in my hands. But what's even cooler than that is the fact that this laptop is actually made from a material called serraluminum, which is actually 30% lighter than regular aluminum. It's also three times stronger than aluminum as well. And the actual display on this is beautiful. It is a 14 inch OLED display. So it is unreal, super sharp and vibrant. So whether I'm working, I'm editing, I'm just watching Netflix, it is a beautiful screen to view. And the battery life on this thing is probably the most insane thing. It is up to 32 hours of battery life, so you're never going to have to worry about finding a charger when you're out traveling or you're at a coffee shop working. This thing will last you all day, no issues. So if you guys are looking for a laptop that is as clean and as functional as your guys' outfit, hopefully. We still haven't seen the rest though. This is definitely the laptop for you. If you guys are interested in the Asus A14, I'll leave the link in the description below and shout out to Asus for sponsoring today's video. Let's get back to roasting your guys' outfits. Dude, there's no way. He's living in the future. How did he know that I was gonna make that comment before? threw on socks because he knew. Oh, that's hilarious. So I don't know if you're being intentional with this and you didn't want to show your feet or this is actually how you rock it. I'm assuming that this is actually the way that you rock it. This is a big no-no. Never wear socks with sandals. It completely defeats the purpose of open-toe shoes. Like what's the point if you're gonna wear socks? Now, moving up from that, the rest of the outfit looks really nice. It is tailored well. Everything fits you well. I would change your watch strap to something a bit lighter to match your pants or maybe even just a silver bracelet. And I noticed you have a fake Cartier bracelet and some beads. Dude's heart just dropped. I'm not that good, dude. I have no idea if that's real or not, but we'll just assume for the video that it's real. You and my friend are going into the almost there section. Oh God. Oh God. At least you got the physique going for you, bro. He definitely thinks he's in some sort of anime edit right now. You did it! No one can deny though that you are in good shape. Your arms look huge. So you got that going for you, like I said. And it's so funny too, because he came in with his DM, so confident. This is drip, by the way. He had to let me know that this is drip. So I don't know if this is a troll or not, but we're going to rate it as if this is not a troll. Never wear athletic clothes unless you are training. If you're outside running, if you're at the gym, don't wear it as like your regular day outfit. It's completely pointless. It doesn't look good. Because we need to change literally everything about the fit, you are gonna be the first person to go into the needs major improvement section. Please don't beat me up though. Okay, we have some redemption thankfully. This is a very well-coordinated outfit dude. Everything fits perfect. I love the trousers, the polo, the overcoat is perfect length for you as well. The one thing that I've definitely changed with your outfit is your watch. I don't know if it's just the picture, but that watch looks like you're about to pull a Ben 10 Any second here is huge and because you've gone for a more dressy formal look you definitely want to go with a smaller watch Maybe even a rectangular watch similar to a tank. This is not a big issue I would change your shoes for a black low for a black boot or even a black sneaker I don't think the white really adds much to this outfit, but that's like extremely minimal So we're gonna put you into the almost there section. You're very close to a clean. Okay. This one is super simplistic There's really nothing to critique with this outfit. Just a black shirt with some linen pants and a watch So there's no real errors within his outfit. This is very simplistic You know you got money though when you start buying dirty shoes like golden goose is a different breed bro How are they managing to sell these? That's crazy. Apart from that bro fits clean So it's gonna go into the super clean because there's not much to critique. That was a very safe outfit choice Super clean outfit dude. Wow everything fits really well pants fit exceptionally well I love that polo that jacket very similar to the Zara jacket the one thing that I would change and this is just super minimal is the Actual shoe color. I would just change out the shoes for a black shoe with a gum bottom I think that would flow so much better with your outfit You're not gonna have that big contrast break by your feet, but it's still super clean with the white So that is going into the super clean section. It would be a smash though if it was black with some gum bottoms Okay, so honestly, this is a really nice monochromatic fit obviously This is not my style you guys know my style, but for him he's got all the proportions down There's nothing wrong with his outfit at all. It actually looks really good on him. So this is super clean, dude Okay, this is nice. I honestly really like this quarter zip color. That is beautiful Might have to cut that myself too as for the shoes That's the only thing that I would change actually is to go for a light brown suede sneaker because it's gonna get that little detail from the zipper and it goes really well with all of colors But dude, this is super clean. There's nothing really to change about it. Super clean. What am I looking at here, bro? We need a whole new category for this one. I'm sorry, dude. I clearly just don't understand the truth But in my mind wearing baggy denim jeans like that. I would not pair it with the slim Chelsea boot So if I was recreating this outfit, this is how I would do it I would change that denim jacket So that's the same color as the denim jeans that you're wearing and 100% the footwear needs to be Tim's with this outfit It just needs to be Tim and then it's also add a backwards cap. I'm pretty happy with that actually we almost forgot We need the cross chain. There we go. It's 50 Oh, I apologize my G is just completely out of my style realm is probably beyond me But because you've put this into my video you are going to be joining our friend here in the needs major All right, this has to be a smash. He's literally wearing I think every single item I've ever recommended. That's the quarter zip that I had recommended once. Those might be the suit to play, sand trousers that I have, and he's even got the coach Gotham duffel. This has to be a smash. Is that an AP too? Oh my days, dude. Rich, rich. Wow, you are going into the smash, bro. What a way to close out the video. I am very happy with this tier board. Honestly, you guys have massively improved from the last time, I'm extremely impressed. Thank you so much for everybody that joined this video. Thank you for being great sports. And if you didn't get in, I apologize. I just had so many people sending me outfits and will continue to do these if it gets enough likes and comments. So if you wanna see it again, make sure that you comment and I'll catch you boys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " So we are officially a week and a bit out from spring. So I know you guys are absolutely fiending for a 2025 spring wardrobe. In today's video, I've put together 10 different outfits using all the different spring essentials, mainly early spring outfits because it is still quite cold. But I've included multiple brands as well as alternatives that will be linked in the description below so you guys can build it on your own budget. And for you guys's reference, I am five foot eight and I'm wearing a small and everything you see here and I'm 150 pounds of pure muscle. All right, so starting our first spring outfit off with a nice casual look. This is something you can wear to a coffee shop. This is something you can wear to school. I'm rocking this beautiful cotton cable knit sweater from Ralph Lauren and I paired it with the Tommy Hill figure puffer jalei in the Navy. This combination, the sweater polo and the jalei, ultimate most elite combination for spring time. For the pants, I am wearing some Massimo Duty tapered fit mid blue denim. And then on the feet, we have the Adidas, Samba, OGs in the Navy. Outfit number two. because Spring is like a woman when she is hungry, never knowing what she wants. Sometimes it's going to be sunshine and rainbows, other times it's going to be fucking monsoon. So you'll need a nice water repellent cotton jacket like this one from Mango. This is definitely a more mature jacket that's quite refined due to its tapered structure with its buttons and then this scrunch on the back. It's very old money-esque. Underneath it, I've paired it with a white long sleeve holo cardigan from Suitsupply. For the pants, I'm wearing some white denim in the athletic fit from Abercrombie. And as for the shoes, I'm wearing the Adidas handball specials in the suede brown colorway. Next up, from a guys that want to wear dark outfits, we have these brown hybrid knit cardigan from Massimo Dutti. The material breakdown on this is outstanding. It is 100% goat suede, 100% wool. I was just not expecting that from Massimo Dutti, to be honest. And this actually is the only garment within this entire video that is in a medium. For some reason, Massimo Dutti does this on some of their items where they just have medium upwards. They don't have excess and they don't have smalls. So this is a medium, still fits nice. As for the pants that I'm wearing, I'm wearing the good old reliable River Island police say pants and I've paired it with a brown suede belt from Banana Republic and then on my feet I'm wearing these LaCos sneakers. I don't know what they're called, they sent them to me. Doesn't seem to be on the website anymore, so I apologize. Moving on to outfit number four. For a nice warm spring day, you can wear something like this, I'm wearing a braided knit polo from Mango. I know what you're thinking, another cable knit, another braided knit. How many of these are gonna be in the video? Let me tell you right now, there's gonna be a lot more. What can I say? I'm addicted to texture for the pants. I'm wearing a nice slim cotton chino and on the feet I'm wearing a pair of the beautiful suit supply suede loafers I absolutely can't wait to wear these again because thank you for is raining all the time I'm gonna have to wait till most likely the summertime to wear these moving on to outfit number five. We have the Ralph Lauren drip I'm wearing the linen cotton polar bear sweater. I really like these sweaters dude. They're honestly way too expensive for what they are I'm looking for an alternative right now, but I just I don't know what it is It's playful, but it also looks good at the same time. It doesn't look too childish underneath it I'm wearing a striped shirt so I can add a little bit of detail to the outfit and I paired it with some tapered fit Massimo duty blue denim once again to keep it casual and then I've added the adidas handball Specials honestly, this is probably my favorite outfit throughout the entire 10 outfits outfit number six We have a very clean simplistic outfit once again some cable knit in here. I'm rocking this beautiful cable knit cotton cardigan in the Navy from Tommy Hilfiger. I'm calling it right now. I am going to single-handedly blow up Tommy Hilfiger again, mark my words. I'm gonna include it in a few videos. You're gonna see all the other YouTubers, Tommy Hilfiger, Tommy Hilfiger's making a comeback, just like Abercrombie. I should have been in that documentary. You guys remember the early days? Anyways, underneath I have a tank on and for the pants, these are some tapered fit off-white denim from Massimo Dutti and on the feet, we are wearing the Adidas Sambas in the Navy again. Outfit number seven, I'm utilizing Probably my favorite color to wear in the spring and the summertime and that is that sweet baby blue color This is a Ralph Lauren linen cotton sweater polo. The fit is absolutely gorgeous on this polo as you can see And I paired it with some gray chinos and on the feet. I'm wearing the axler goto clean 90s Next outfit number eight again an outfit for a rainy day I'm wearing this navy water repellent quilted bomber jacket from mango this jacket is quite versatile so you can dress this up or dress this down as you please. Underneath, I'm wearing a cotton crew neck from Seven Diamonds. As for the pants, I'm wearing some gray cotton chinos, and on the feet, I'm wearing the Axl Arigato Clean 90s once again. Now for our next outfit, the baby blue finding its way in once again, I'm wearing a cotton mesh homie hill figure quarter zip. This is one of the most comfortable quarter zips I've ever worn, actually considering it's not cashmere in its cotton. Nice and lightweight. Underneath, I've just got a white tee on, and as for the pants, I'm using those Massimo Dutti Cream denim jeans again, And I paired it with the brown suede banana republic belt and the suede adidas finishing it off strong with outfit number 10 We have this beautiful wool bomber from mass mo duty. I know you guys are gonna like this jacket is very similar to that old Zara jacket I had before the fire I'm always looking to find one that's gonna replace that one underneath. I'm wearing a black t-shirt from unbound Reno for the pants I'm wearing a wash black straight fit denim from suit supply and on the feet. I am wearing the lacost Sneaker. So I hope you guys like these outfits I put together as well as the items I chose I tried to add a lot more casual options into this video hence the amount of denim that I was wearing which I don't usually wear as you guys know But just for you so if you guys enjoyed today's video Please like and drop a comment for your boy for the algorithm and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you"

        "transcript": " Today we will be going through my premium daily carry items for 2025. So just to make things clear, this isn't actually everything that I carry with me every single day. There's some things that I carry with me every single day as well as things that I use every single day. So it's a mixture of both. Just wanted to make the video a little bit more interesting, add a few more items. So starting off my wallets, I actually have two wallets that I use for different occasions. This first wallet here is a Tom Ford embossed crocodile wallet in this sick blue colorway So this this is not a real crocodile leather wallet It is embossed so they just put a print on it But I happen to notice it about two years ago when I was on essence and it was on sale for about 30% off And you guys know I'm not one for designer nor am I one for bright colors like this But I don't know what it was I saw it and I was like damn dude blue crocodile wallet that is so sick So this is a wallet that I use for short trips when I don't need too many cards If I'm going out for dinner, if I'm going out with friends, I'll bring this one with me because it only has six card slots. An extremely nice wallet. I really love this one. My other wallet here on the other hand is a pocket organizer that is made out of real Himalaya crocodile and I actually got this custom made for me. So everything you see here was handcrafted by this guy's company, Oak and Honey. He's just a craftsman. He does all of his leather work by himself and I asked him to do a taupe colorway on the inside, include this many card slots, etc. and use Himalaya crocodile. You did a fantastic job. Stitching is perfect. But I use this wallet mainly for when I'm going traveling and I need more cards because it has an extensive amount of card slots as well as this can hold cash. The next thing we have here, I have three of these because I use these all the time. This is a little Creed atomizer. If you guys don't know what an atomizer is, it's basically a mini fragrance bottle that you can take with you traveling and it's refillable. So what you do is you take the tube out, you take your desired fragrance, Just pull off the little nozzle cap here, just like that. And then you take the bottom, where you see there's this little hole here, and you basically give this atomizer back shots until it fills up. So as you can see, it is filled up about halfway. So this is really nice tool that you can put this in your car, you can put this in your toiletry case when you're going traveling. It's got a magnetic cap. It is wrapped in creeds leather with their branding on it. Just a nice little accessory that looks aesthetic and serves a purpose. Next up, we have my watch. You guys were on my ass for only having two watches. Every single time I'd post an outfit and I'd throw in the T-Sew or the Long James. Everybody's like, dude, get a new watch, man. You wear the same watches all the time. You guys think I made him money? So I felt peer pressured. I went and got myself a brand new watch. This is a Rose Gold Patek Philippe Nautilus. I wish. Fun fact, this is a Mido Multifort TV, 35 millimeter and this design actually came before the protect plate. That's how I cope with the fact that I don't have a protect lead Jokes aside, this is an absolutely gorgeous watch. It has a beautiful rose gold stainless steel bracelet The face is brown which I needed a brown watch because that seems to be the color that I wear the most I was like I need a brown dial watch and then it's also got diamonds on the face for the markers Which is really sick. They're real diamonds, too. So absolutely love this watch I haven't taken it off since I bought it about four ish months ago It's really replaced both my other watches right now. Now the next item we have here is sunglasses. If you guys are followers of my content, you watch it frequently. You'd know that I add sunglasses to virtually every outfit that I wear because it just adds some more visual interest to the outfit. Now these particular glasses here have this beautiful translucent tortoise color. It's also got gold accents and gold rivet wire going through the acetate. It's also got gold nose bridge as well. and then it is finished with this beautiful gradient. It kind of gives a little bit of mystery. You can see my eyes still, but there is a little bit of a darkness gradient at the top there. Everybody is always asking me where I'm buying these glasses from, and I haven't been answering, and that's because the brand doesn't actually exist yet. Next item we have here is this absolute work of art. This is a duffel bag from today's sponsor Songmont, and this is called the Medium Your Duffel Bag, and it comes in this sandal suede colorway. I've never owned a suede bag in my life. I saw this on their website and I was like, I need that. Especially because it's in brown too. And what's crazy is I actually fully inspected this bag, looking for a flaw with the stitching, but there's no flaws at all. It seems to have been crafted by God himself. So as for actual materials used in this bag, it is extremely premium. They're using calf suede. So you have this beautiful plush, soft texture. The bag itself is actually extremely lightweight. It is super versatile, unbelievably classy as you can see. And for the hardware on the bag, they're using jewelry grade stainless steel vacuum, electro plated hardware, which is fade resistant. And as for its size, it's a 24 hour duffel bag. So this is perfect for when you're going to a hotel, you're staying at your girlfriend's place. You can fit a full day's worth of clothes in this bag. And also if you have a 14 inch laptop, you can throw that bad boy in here as well. So if you guys are interested in this duffel, I will leave a link in the description below. And I'll also leave a link to the website so you can check out all the other bags they have to offer. Next up, we have the vehicle that I drive every single day. This is my BMW M3. What do you think? The car's looking really sick by the way. I actually just installed some laser lights on my car and it completely transformed the look of my car. You know what, if you guys are interested in car review, a car walk around, mod walk around, let me know in the comments section and maybe I'll do that if not that you guys are interested. As for the actual key chain this is on, this is the same leather that was used on my wallet. This guy actually made this for me and sent it to me as a gift recently around Christmas time. And this is Himalaya crocodile, exact same leather on the inside as well. And he finished it off with the colors of BMW, because he knows I drive a BMW. I thought that was really thoughtful. Straight up G, dude. Now, another thing that I use every single day is a brown leather journal. This is a 365 day journal. And I am a person who just loves to write. I really don't like hyping things on the computer. I much prefer to write with a pen and paper, whether it's my goals, whether I'm journaling, whether I'm creating content ideas, everything goes into these 365 day journals and they're not expensive either. You can buy them off of Amazon, like $17 Canadian and they look good. They look really nice just sitting around. Now as for the item that I use the most being a content creator, I use the iPhone 15 Pro Max. I really did not want to upgrade to this phone guys. I have an iPhone 12 and the only reason I upgraded to this was just because the battery life absolutely blew. And you know Apple, they don't allow you to just replace your battery. You have to go basically buy a brand new phone. Biggest pet peeve is buying new phones. I think it's the fattest waste of money. However, I will say that the camera on this is fantastic. I've actually been using it quite a lot within my content. So I guess it kind of makes up for it. But yeah, I have the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the case that I'm using here is the Ramoa phone case. This is ridiculously expensive. I actually got this given to me as a gift from a friend, but it looks really sick. I really do like the aesthetic. A lot of people compliment me on this and are always asking where I got it from. Now, the next item I have here is the headphones that I use every day. These are the AirPods Maxes. Surprise, the basic influencer headphones. I actually love these things. I use these at the gym, I use it for editing. One of the biggest advantages to these headphones for me, I used to have the Bose QC45s, and the only reason I upgraded to these was because they actually got stolen from me at the gym. I placed them down for a second and turned around, they're gone. So I decided to buy the AirPods Maxes because I am in the Apple ecosystem already. They are actually the only headphones I've ever worn. on the plane that I can use ANC and it not cause issues with my ear and give me a headache. I found with all the other headphones that I had, the Bose Swarm, the Sony ones, it caused issues when I was using the noise canceling mode, and this is the only headphones to have not done that. So that alone made these headphones worth it for me. That's why I justify it. And finally, we have the camera that I shoot all of my content on, which is the one you guys are watching on, so I can't show it live. You're gonna see the B roll footage right here. This is the Sony A7S III. I have a Sigma 28 to 70 millimeter f2.8 lens on it and dude, this camera changed my life. If I'd never picked up the camera, started creating content, I would have never built any of this stuff. I would never have anything that I do have right now. This amazing audience. The people that I meet now is just insane that I have an opportunity to meet these people due to the content that I produce. So I'm extremely, extremely grateful. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you enjoyed it, please drop your boy a like and a comment for the algorithm I'll catch you guys in the next video. I can't uh, can't punch you but just imagine"

        "transcript": " So a lot of you guys are at the age now where you're looking to move out, you're looking to get your first apartment, maybe you've already moved out and you wanna create your own dream aesthetic space. So I personally moved out 10 months ago into this apartment that you see here. It came completely unfurnished. I have meticulously curated this place to create this modern young bachelor, clearly Portia enthusiast apartment style. So after 10 months of gradually buying furniture, adding decor items to this space, I'm finally happy with how it's starting to look. I say starting because I'm still not finished, honestly. I feel like you'll never end with decor items. There's always a way that you can make the space feel better. But in today's video, I'll be sharing with you guys a step-by-step process, as well as product recommendations to build your dream aesthetic space. FYI, I'm not a professional interior designer. People have just told me that they really like my apartment, so that's what I'm sharing with you guys today and how I built mine. And as always, everything that I show in today's video is gonna be linked in the description below. The first step in building your dream space is figuring out what color palette you're gonna go with. Now a good rule of thumb is to stick to three foundational colors. This is very similar to building an outfit. I feel like I'm just building a fashion video because a lot of the principles in fashion are gonna apply to interior design as well. So easy way to do it, three foundational colors. You can obviously implement more colors. It just becomes a little bit more difficult and complicated. The first color you're gonna have is your primary color. This is the color that covers the majority of your space. This would be something like your walls. Here in my space, they're white. I didn't have an option for choosing it because I'm renting this apartment. to get kicked out if I painted all the walls. So I had white is my primary color. Now your secondary color supports the primary color and is used in medium size pieces. These are things like your couches, your rugs, curtains, side tables. For me, I use gray. And FYI, you don't need to use the exact same shade of the color. As you can see, I've mixed different shades of gray into my space. So just keep that in mind as well. It doesn't need to be all exactly the same shade. And then finally, you have your accent color. Now the goal of the accent color is to add contrast or interest to your space. It's used sparingly in your decor items, coffee table, shelves, pillows, and artwork. For me, in my space, I've used brown. Now, like I said, you can definitely add in more colors and make it look great. You just add them in sparingly throughout my apartment. I have multiple different colors. I have blacks, I have blues, I have oranges scattered throughout my entire apartment, but they're not the foundational colors of my space. Now, the next step in the process is to figure out what type of vibe you want to achieve in your place. Now, there's so many different styles in interior design is almost impossible to choose one. So the best way to figure out what actually catches your eye and what you like is to go on Pinterest, like the girls do, and start looking at interior design. As you start to click on these images, it's gonna start to show you more of what your interests are. If you like modern, if you like contemporary, if you like minimalist, industrial, mid-century modern, traditional, it's gonna start to show you those images and from there on, you're gonna be able to figure out what actually stands out to you and what you like. Now after you've figured out your vibe, this is the most fun part. This is when you start to buy your furniture and your decor items to really curate your space. And because everybody's style is gonna be different, I can't recommend furniture and decor items specifically for you. But what I can share with you is the basics of how to make your place look better. And just some things that I've noticed that have made a really big difference in my apartment. Your very first purchase, and your largest purchase probably, is going to be your couch. And the couch really sets the tone for the rest of the apartment. Now, my biggest tip with buying a couch, because I'm not gonna suggest certain couches to you, is to buy a modular couch. Now the reason you want a modular couch is, is because you can simply format it into any shape that you want. Now when it comes to actually moving into the apartment or into the house or moving out, you can take these pieces individually through the door. If you guys have ever tried to pull a solid couch through the door and put it into an elevator, it's a fucking nightmare, as you would know. So the modular couch makes a world of a difference. That is my biggest tip in this video, is to make sure you get yourself a modular couch. And the second tip about the couch is to make sure that you actually go and test out these couches. Don't blind buy a couch that you see. Somebody recommending on Instagram because most of the time these really aesthetic couches are not comfortable at all. I feel like you're sitting on a brick. So make sure that you actually go into the store, sit on them because if you're gonna be hosting people, you're gonna have your family and friends coming over and you're gonna be lounging there, you wanna make sure that it's comfortable and everybody can just sit there and enjoy. Now the second step is to add natural woods into your space. Things like your coffee tables, your side tables, shelving, adding natural woods is really gonna bring some warmth into your space. When I initially moved in here, I had the space all white and that was a massive mistake. It looked like something out of an American Psycho movie. It was just completely soulless. And then as soon as I added in more woods, it really just made the space more homey, which is what you're looking for. Trust me, you don't want the American Psycho style. Tip number three is to be mindful of the shapes of the furniture that you purchase. So one way that I've discovered to build a really nice space is to mix different curvatures and angles together with your furniture. You take a look at my coffee table. My coffee table is a square. So you have all these sharp angular edges. But if you take a look at my couch, you're gonna notice that it's not nearly as sharp. You have these rounded edges that adds nice curvature. It's so much softer. So you want a mixture of these things and between the mixture, it's going to add this beautiful harmony of curvature and edges. So you don't want it to all be the same because it's gonna look kind of unusual if you do it like that. Now, before we move into our next tip, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, Centbird. Now, if you don't know Centbird yet, you really should because it's been on a lot of my videos. Centbird is a really cool fragrance subscription service that makes discovering new scents super easy. So if you ever wanted to try expensive designer fragrances or niche fragrances without having to commit to a full bottle, Centbird is the way to go. For just $8 for your first month, you can get a generous 30 day supply that lets you experience each of the scents that you choose. Two fragrances that I've been on, that I've been using recently that I really like are Devel France Por Aum by Michael Jermain. It features top notes of nutmeg, refreshing water notes, Roman Kalamile, balanced by amberwood and incense. Super nice fragrance that I wore when I was in Hawaii actually. The next one is John Vivarto's Oud. It's a bold, woody, spicy fragrance with sweet tobacco, Persian saffron, Malabar pepper, and authentic Oud oil. It's perfect for luxurious evenings when you really wanna make an impression. So if you guys are interested in trying out scent bird, scan the QR code or use the link below. And with my coupon code BAL455, you'll get 55% off at Scentbird. Plus you'll get free delivery to your door and a free case, which means that you're getting the product for half the price, which is only $8. So it's an absolute steal. Let's get back to the video. So step number four is to layer textures. At this point, I really do feel like I'm just making a fashion video because the concepts into interior design are almost linear to fashion. So just like when building an outfit, you don't want all the exact same finish. You might mix a ribbed sweater with cotton pants, or you might mix denim with wool. You're gonna have these different textures and that's what makes the outfit look good. So it's very similar to interior design. You take a look at my coffee table. My coffee table is smooth, but it has cracks in it. My side tables, they're ribbed around the edge, so it's fluted. My couch, it has a linen texture. My rug, it has a knit texture. So adding things like woods, linens, leathers into your space, it's going to create a really nice subtle contrast of textures. Now the next step is your lighting choice. Now lighting is super important for building a cozy space. I'm sure you guys have all seen that trend on social media where it says, never turn on the big lights. The point of this is that the ceiling light basically emulates like hospital lighting. It's super harsh. It does not look nice. And what they show is their floor lamps, their small lamps that they have on their shelves, emitting this really nice warm lighting that's nice and soft and cozy. Now the key to actually getting that warm lighting is your color temperature. You wanna make sure that your color temperature for your bulbs or for the light that you choose has a Kelvin of 2700 to 3K. This is the color temperature that's gonna give you that really nice warm orange, almost candle-like appearance. Any higher in the kelvins, you're gonna start to get more of that fluorescent LED-style light that you would see in a hospital. So you wanna make sure that you stay out of there. One of the easiest ways to actually get these colors is to use Philips Hue Smart Lights. You can put these into your lamps and you can set it to that orange color. And then you also have the option to change it to RGB colors if you'd like. If you want purples and blues and stuff, you have the option for that as well. Even the light strips you can do it with too. So Phillips Hue is one of my favorites for creating that really nice warm lighting. All right, now we are going to move into the details. These are the small items that really make a big difference in making your space look more luxurious. So the first item is valet trays. I am an absolute fiend for valet trays. I don't know what it is, but I fiend for valet trays like a crackhead looking for his next hit. It's crazy. But adding a metal, a stone, a leather valet tray, whether it's to your desk, your nightstand, your entryway storage, your coffee tables, it just looks so good. and then when you put your items on there, it just makes your items look more expensive too. Also, you can get one like the current Meg 3, which I have on my desk, and that allows me to also charge my phone and my AirPods at the same time, as well as display my items and keep them organized in one spot. Another small detail that doesn't cost a lot of money, very similar to the valet tray is soap trays. Now soap trays go on your washroom vanities or they go on your kitchen counter next to your sink and you place your soap bottles on top. And what it does is it really just gives it a more luxurious hotel vibe. You buy them in stone, you can buy them in metal, you can buy them in wood and they look fantastic. The best thing to pair it with is some amber glass soap bottles. You can buy these on Amazon. And what it does is it just brings the cohesiveness and then pairing it with that soap tray. It really does just look like some luxury hotel that you're staying in. And not to mention, you're also just gonna waste a lot less plastic because now you can buy those big soap bottles and you can just refill your hand soap and dish soap. Now the next thing you want to add to your space that makes a big difference is real plants. Now, trust me, I used to be the biggest real plant hater. But the people that were telling me to get real plants weren't lying, it really does make a difference to the space. There's something about a real plant that just brings life to the space. Obviously it does bring life to the space because it's alive, but just makes a difference. The plastic ones don't look nearly as good. And that green, it just pops differently when it's real too. Now because my apartment doesn't have the most light, although I have all these massive windows, the sun actually goes around my building. So I never have any direct light in here, so most of my plants died and I do have some fake plants. but believe me, once I move into a new apartment that has some serious light, bro, we're gonna be looking like Singapore. Garden Oasis, basically. Next, one of the easiest ways to add personality to your space is through your artwork. Now, because I'm not a Picasso fan and I don't appreciate that type of artwork, AliExpress has been the go. Honestly, AliExpress is so underrated. Almost all of my decor pieces are from AliExpress. It's got everything from vintage car prints to abstract prints. You can literally find anything that suits your aesthetic on there. Then once you get your artwork, run to IKEA, Buy yourself some nice frames. They have plenty of minimal modern frames there for a good price. The ones that I have behind me here are Ikea Ribba frames, I believe. Another good way to add personality or space is to get books on your interests. As you guys know, Porsche fan over here, so you know I got a Porsche book. I also have a Rolex book. I have other things that show off my interests. So for you guys, depending on what you like, there is going to be decor books for your interests. Go to Amazon and you can literally type in Anything decor wise and you can find something even personal development books You can scatter those around if you don't necessarily know how to style the books You can go on Pinterest again and look up how to style the core books And it's gonna give you plenty of ways to style it and you just copy those the next item totally not an essential by any means But if you're somebody like myself who likes to host you like to have friends and family over getting yourself a home stereo system Next level dude the ones I got behind me is a pair of Sonos arrows 300. I say what you want about Sonos They're overpriced the quality is not that good buddy. I promise you you come over here. We watch conjuring and pull blast You're shitting your pants first jump scare It literally changes the game It really does feel like a movie theater in here when you're sitting next to these things not to mention you can also listen to music on it I'm very happy with my purchase now The final tip for creating a dream space is the smell when you have people over you want them to come into your space and Have it smell fresh and clean. You don't want them to be like what the hell is that? You just eat curry or something like that. You want it to smell clean. So one of the best ways to make a clean smelling apartment without it being toxic is to get yourself some essential oil diffusers. Scatter those throughout your place, depending on how big it is. You might need one, you might need three. You just got to look at the square footage that it releases that scent. Next one you want to get some room spray for your furniture. Make sure that they're non-toxic natural ones using essential oils again. And the final thing you'll want is some candles, a beeswax candles, because beeswax candles aren't going to be toxic either. So once you put all of these things together, you're gonna have a pretty nice space and it doesn't even matter if you're living at home. You can implement a lot of these into your bedroom as well. It's not just for people that have moved out or looking to style their apartment. This goes for any sort of room. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, I'd appreciate a like and a comment. Happy New Year to you guys as well and I'll catch you boys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " Today, we're gonna be building a full-quality workout wardrobe from scratch. We're not just gonna do it with any brand. We're doing it with a world-renowned athletic brand that's known for its sleek design, its high-quality garments, and its maximum aura. Boys, we've done it. We've completed life. We are partnering today with Lululemon. Holy shh. So not only are we creating a wardrobe that's gonna give you some serious aura when you're walking around, but with the holiday season just around the corner, these are also perfect gifts for fitness enthusiasts in your life or for yourself. No judgment, I know it's probably for yourself. Let's be honest. And as always, everything will be linked in the description below and for your reference, I am wearing a size small in all of the upper garments and an excess in the bottoms. So first up, every gym wardrobe needs an athletic t-shirt. This one here is the Metal Vent Tech Short Sleeve. It's in this graphite gray slash black. And as you can see, this makes me look like a freaking Greek god. Fit is insane, it's snug around the arms and the chest, lightweight and stretchy and the texture. Unreal. We got carbon fiber t-shirts before GTA 6 drops. Like what's going on? Next up, from a heavy sweaters out there, we have the metal vent tech sleeveless shirt. The best part about this one is that there's no massive armholes showing off your ribs. It's got a snug, flattering fit, just like the short sleeve, and it's got that same beautiful pattern that we talked about with the previous shirt. It's definitely a great pick for maximum breathability without the overexposure. Now, for the more conservative guy that doesn't want to show off any skin at all, but still want something lightweight. The license to train the long sleeve shirt is a killer choice. It's got the curved hem. It's a super soft material and the vapor colorway. Absolutely fire. Moving on to pump covers. Every gym wardrobe needs a pump cover. My personal choice, half zips. So the first half zip we have here is the waffle knit half zip. As you know, I'm a fiend for texture. I even go for textured pieces in my gym wardrobe. And this one does not disappoint. The waffle texture feels amazing on the skin. The silhouette follows your body lines perfectly and it just has the right thickness to keep you warm without you overheating. Another one of my favorites is the metal vent tech half zip. Yes, as you can tell, I'm absolutely obsessed with this particular collection. Got that same lightweight stretchy features as the short sleeve, but now you got some long sleeves and you also got the zipper around the neck. This is perfect for runners as well. Now, moving down into our lower garment, every wardrobe needs a pair of sweats slash joggers. Now these ones here are the Steady State Classic Fit joggers in the Heathered Core Ultra Light Gray. One of the best things about Lululemon is that they have options for shorter guys. They're very inclusive. These here are a 28 inch inseam, which lots of companies don't offer 20 inch inseams. And these specific joggers are extremely comfortable. They feature zipper pockets, a drawstring waist. I tend to wear these everywhere. I wear them to the gym or I wear them just lounging around my home. They're like the perfect pair of sweat pants. The next pair of pants here we have is the In-Mind Pants. Now these are ideal if you're looking for mobility out of your pants. I personally have been stretching and doing yoga for about two years now and these are the ideal pants, being able to fully stretch and not feel restricted by your garments. So they're super stretchy, sweat waking, ventilated and they have a slim tapered fit for this really nice sleek look. Next thing we have is the most versatile pants on this list and this is the Pace Breaker pants. Whether you're running, you're sprinting, you're stretching, you're lifting, these pants are designed for maximum comfort while doing any of these things. They featured zipper pockets, a hidden phone sleeve, draw strings, zippered ankles, and this mesh fabric for ventilation. It is a true do-it-all piece. Now cutting those pants down into shorts, we have the Pace Raker five inch linerless shorts. These are my absolute favorite shorts. I tend to wear these for a lot of things other than just working out. Whether I'm going out in the summertime or I have been guilty of wearing these swimming as well. But if you're cooking your quads off the bones weekly, these are gonna be the ideal shorts to show off. your quad development, they're really lightweight, super comfortable, and they come in a mirrored of color ways. Now if you're not into showing off too much leg, the vented tennis shorts, six inch are a great alternative. These are designed for tennis, but versatile enough for other activities. They feature more relaxed fit around the thighs, about six inch outer length, and then the liner drops down to nine inches. The material is super stretchy and comfortable, making them perfect for various different scenarios. It doesn't have to be for tennis, but if you are a tennis player, It's got a bunch of features like a pocket for your balls, not those balls, your tennis balls to go in. And lastly, no workout wardrobe is complete without a sleek and comfortable running shoe. And the perfect shoe is the Men's Beyond Feel running shoe. Look at these beauties. Chee! So I went with the sleek white colorway as usual. They feature a breathable mesh upper, flex like a dream, and have a foam cushion sole for maximum comfort. They are as aesthetic as they are functional. So boys, whether you're gifting this to another person or you're treating yourself to these items, which I assume is the latter, Lululemon has everything that you need to create the perfect gym wardrobe. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, please drop your boy a like and a comment and I'll catch you guys in the next video. God bless."

        "transcript": " With Black Friday passing just two days ago, the deals are still running right now, which means it is the perfect time to get all of your Christmas shopping done, so you don't need to spend as much money, but you can still get high-quality gifts. So I've created a Christmas list gift guide for a stylish guide that are not basic, it's not underwear, socks, and some deodorant. These are unique, specific gifts that range across multiple different categories. And as always, everything we show in today's video is going to be linked in the description below, so it's nice and easy to shop. So starting with our first category, which is clothing and accessories. Most guys that follow me are gonna have a watch or two, and most guys just have a watch in general. So getting them a leather watch roll, like this one from La Tener or Aspinal of London, to make sure their watches are safe while traveling is an amazing gift, especially if they value aesthetics. And staying on the topic of traveling, we have the leather toiletry bag. This is also another great gift that's gonna last them a lifetime. The Zip toiletry bag from Leatherology or the Aspinal of London one here have options for initial engraving, so you can give them a custom toiletry bag with their initials on it. It's pretty sick. Next, we have the Ugg's Tasman. Now they might initially look at this and be like, what the fuck is that? And then put them on and they'll never take them off because they're so comfortable. I know from experience, I'm wearing mine right now. And for the color options for these, the black, the brown, or even the leather one are probably the best ones. Another footwear option, if you wanna get this person, a sneaker is the Adidas Handball Speciale shoes in suede. It's super clean and they're extremely popular right now. Or if you can't get those, because I see they sell out quite quickly, is the Adidas Sambas either in suede or leather as well. Or if this person likes to dress up quite formally, or they just don't have a high quality formal shoe yet. If you have a larger budget, look at options from Scoroso or from SuitSupply. Any of their shoes are going to be fantastic and they're gonna last them quite a long time. Number six, everybody appreciates a nice quality wool or cashmere sweater. Some of the best ones that I've found right now is like this one from Banana Republic. It's a Merino wool quarter zip and this is crazy value for the price. It's even hard to believe that this is real. $36 for 100% Merino wool quarter zip is insane. and then I think they also have 25% on top of that. So it's like, what would that even be? $20? Another great option at a great price is the J Crew brushed wool crew neck sweaters. You guys saw, I wore these in my most recent video. Fantastic, the quality is insane and just that texture is beautiful. For cable knits, Everlane has this sweet Marina wool cable knit, which is a bit on the chunkier side, which can be nice for some people. If they want something thinner, you can go for the J Crew cashmere cable knit sweater. Number seven is for the fitness guys. will always be happy to receive a quarter zip. The men's under armor tech half zip, long sleeves, the Nike Pace quarter zip, or the Lululemon metal vent tech half zip for the bougie guys. Number eight, definitely a more expensive item, but if you wanna splurge on this person, you feel like they deserve it this year. A leather duffel bag is probably one of the best gifts that one can receive if they don't have one yet. The coach Ventura bag is a great option. The leatherology barrel gym bag, which has this compartment for shoes, pretty cool. If you think this person would prefer something with the design and they don't mind if their bag is made out of canvas. You could go for this one from La Tenor, which is their 24 hour travel duffel bag, which I think is super stylish. Or if you wanna give them something ultra premium and they just want everything that I have, we have the Gotham duffel bag. It's a super classy bag. Number nine, another travel item, a carry-on suitcase. These ones from Monos here, the carry-on pros are fantastic. They look super aesthetic. The ones in gray, black, or white would be perfect for a male. And because it is a carry-on suitcase, it's not really gonna get damaged too. So this is something that they could have for a lifetime. And number 10 is a leather bracelet from MainSight. Any of the options that they have on their website are super stylish and they can wear it on their opposite wrist of their watch. And it's just another accessory that they can add to their outfit. Now moving into our next category, which is the grooming and self-care section, let's start with the Salt and Stone body wash. This body wash smells absolutely fantastic. It's like a mini spa every time you shower and the guys that appreciate finer things in life will really like this present. Next, we have the Tom Ford Discovery Fragrance Set. If he's into Cologne, he probably wants a Tom Ford Fragrance and this is an easy way that he can try out those smaller size fragrances without having to dedicate all that money to a large size bottle and potentially not like it. Next, if you have a slightly smaller budget but you still wanna get this person a nice gift, is a manicure set from Mr. Green. Now, I have just recently bought the Mr. Green manicure set and it is 10 million times better than any other manicure set I've ever had. It's not gonna break and it is unbelievably sharp. Like this will cut your finger off, it's so sharp. So this is a great gift and it comes in this little stylish zip bag as well. Another great bathroom upgrade is a silicone shower tool. You can get these from toolertrees or you can get these from Amazon. These keep everything super organized in your shower and they're functional and it's gonna make his shower routine even better. Next for the guy that cares about a little bit of luxury and aesthetics, a fragrance atomizer from Creed is a great gift. It's perfect for travel, tossing in your gym bag, taking in your car. It's a very small but extremely thoughtful gift for somebody that appreciates aesthetics. Next item, super underrated, is luxury towels. It's one of those items that you don't know that you need it until you've actually tried one before. Go for Turkish cotton or something plush that feels luxurious. Next up, teeth whitening kit. If he is into self care or just wants a brighter smile, this is a perfect gift. Now before we move into our next gift idea, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, Intel. If you're looking for the ultimate productivity tool this holiday season, the Dell XPS 13, powered by the Intel Core Ultra, is a perfect gift idea as well. It's sleek, it's lightweight, It's got a stunning OLED display, which makes everything from work to browsing entertainment, such a pleasure. What really sets it apart though, is it's AI powered features. With Microsoft Copilot, it's like having a little personal assistant that can help you stay on top of things. For example, for your guys' personal development journey, if you wanted to build schedules for the gym, for example, you want to optimize your gym routine, you want to create daily schedules, you want to just organize your ideas to hit your goals faster, it can help you do that. Plus the AI tools for photo editing are also fantastic. if you wanna use Photoshop or Lightroom, super easy to do so. So it's great if you guys want to level up your Instagram profile. It's also got a fantastic battery, so you're not gonna have any issues with it dying throughout the day. So whether you're working on yourself, you're building your brand, you just wanna be more productive. This AI PC has everything that you need to elevate your routine. And let's get back to our video. Now, this next one is kinda odd to ask for, but a bidet attachment. It's one of those items that nobody wants to ask for, but they low key want it really bad because it's just a game changer. And last item in this category, a toothbrush, but not just any regular toothbrush, a two-in-one toothbrush, one that flosses their teeth as well as brushes, Succas Nios II. Now, moving into our next category, which is the home slash home decor section, starting with the Phillips Hue smart lights. These are perfect for those guys who love to control their space's ambience, whether it's setting the mood for a movie, hosting friends, these lights will make any room feel more modern. For someone who loves high-end scents, the A-Sope Room Spray is fantastic, subtle, sophisticated, and it's gonna make his space melt amazing without being too overpowering. I spray it all over my furniture and on my bed sheets. Speaking of scents, if this person likes candles, the Lilabo Discovery candle set is a fantastic option. It includes these mini versions of their iconic scents like Santel 26 or Fig 15. He gets to discover all these high end fragrances and it doubles as a little decor piece as well. Now I understand candles aren't for every guy, so a good alternative is the Vitruvi Stone Diffuser, pair it with essential oils and it's gonna make the space melt amazing. Next, if this person's space, their house, their apartment, their room is kind of boring looking, there's no color, you can get them an alley expressed throw blanket. There's so many different options you can get in there, you can make custom blankets, but one that I really like that I'm currently waiting for because Canada Post is striking right now. I don't know if I'm ever going to receive it at this point is the Nordic throw blanket. It's beautiful and it's actually made of wool as well. Number six for a unique lighting option is the Wiz light pole. It's a cool addition to anybody's place. It's minimal, stylish, it's the perfect accent lighting for the corner of a room. Number seven is a large mirror from IKEA. Everybody knows the Hovett mirror is insane. This is one of the best mirrors that you can buy, especially for guys that follow my content because you don't want them looking like a slob, do you? You want them to be looking fresh every time they leave the house and they need to see their outfits. This is a great gift. Next, a very thoughtful decor gift is actually a decor book. So think of this person's interests, what do they like? Get them a decor book for their place, for their room, for their apartment. I personally like cars, so I have car books. I also like fashion, so I have fashion books. You can find them on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Chapters, HomeSense, lots of places to buy these. And the final item in this category is new linen sheets. This is the ultimate upgrade for his bed. Go for brands like Brook linen or parachute for super high quality breathable sheets. Now moving into our next category, we have the tech and gadgets section. And our first gift here is a monitor light. A monitor light is a very thoughtful gift for somebody that stays up late gaming, they're working late, they're studying on the computer. It helps your eyes so they're not straining. If they have a curved monitor, the on-way curved monitor light bar is fantastic, or if they have a straight monitor, you can get them to BenQ ScreenBar Pro LED. Next, we have the current Mag3 in the brown leather option. This is a sleek wireless charging tray that keeps all the daily essentials, like your phone, keys, wallet, AirPods, organized, while simultaneously charging your phone and your AirPods. For the music lovers, the Sonos Aero 100, or if you want a more immersive experience, the Sonos Aero 300 speakers, they both deliver exceptional sound quality. I have the Aeros 300s. They changed the game when it came to movies and listening to music, but they are also quite expensive. Sona's Era 100 is a much more affordable option. Next, a great gift for a person that works from home or spends a ridiculous amount of time at a desk is an ergonomic chair. And this is gonna be by far the most expensive gift on this list, but it's about as important as having a good quality mattress for somebody that sits at the desk a lot. Brands like Haworth, Ranch, Herman Miller, they probably sell the best ergonomic chairs. Number five for a person that cares about their health is more health conscious, is the Aura Ring or Whoop so that they can track and analyze their sleep. Number six is for the journalists, the writers, the people that just like to jot their notes down, is the Leatherology Snap Journal. This is a refillable journal and it has that beautiful leather cover. If he's into watching movies, you could get a portable projector like the Yabber L2S, or if you have a larger budget, you could look at the Anker Nebula capsule. Number nine, for his desk setup, you could get him a quality keyboard, something like the Key Crone K2, the Apple Magic Keyboard, or the Logitech MX Keys, all fantastic options. The final gift in this category is the Apple 4K TV. This is a must have for streaming enthusiasts, especially within the Apple ecosystem. It is just such a fantastic product. It's actually super underrated. I would say that it's one of Apple's best products. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, please smash the like button, drop a comment on what your favorite gift is, and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you."

        "transcript": " So I have rushed this video to get it out to you as soon as possible so that you guys can get the best deals on the sickest items this Black Friday. We're gonna be talking about a bunch of different brands like Ralph Lauren, J Crew, Mango, Coach, Everlane, Banana Republic, and many more. And because I've recorded this video on Monday, some of these prices may be subject to change and as we get closer to Black Friday, it might get a bit cheaper, but they also might sell out because I've made this video, which is typically what happens. So as always, everything is gonna be linked in the description below. I made it nice and organized for you guys so you can easily shop. So, starting with our first brand, good old Banana Republic factory. Got some insane deals going on over here with some exceptionally high quality materials used. Starting with a $38, 100% Merino wool polo sweater. $38, doesn't even seem like a real price. And not only that, it's also 20% off in the checkout as well. And that's gonna be the same for all of these items that we talk about. Another one that's 100% Merino wool is these quarter zips and these are only $38. Again, 20% off in the checkout, insane deal. Another cool piece that we have here, not 100% wool, is the tweed cable knit sweater for $36. You know, it's still a pretty good deal. It's a very nice cable knit. If you're looking for a nice zip up jacket, we have this one here for $48. This one is cotton as well. In one of my recent old money jacket videos, we also talked about a quilted jacket and they have this very reasonably priced quilted jacket for $64. And now as for Banana Republic, like their main website, that's not the factory, I wasn't too impressed with the selection that they have. There's one thing on there that I really like and that is the Ribbed Merino Mockneck Sweater. This is 40% off. This is a great item if you guys wanna start to dress more formally. Moving on to our next friend, we have Jay Crew. And Jay Crew is currently running 50% off discounts on select items. One sweater that I wore recently that you guys were big fans of was that Brushed Wool Sweater. And the Brushed Wool Sweater is currently on sale for $89. Highly recommend this sweater, it's fantastic. Also, the Heritage Cotton Cable Knit Cardigan sweater is on sale as well for $56, which is 52% off its regular price. We also have this 100% wool sweater that's super sick. This is the Highland Wool Open Collar sweater with stripe for $99.50. Also 50% off its regular price. If you're looking for a lightweight cotton cable knit sweater that you can dress up, there's this heritage cotton cable knit sweater in the camel in the green for 49.50. Finally, something that I just went on a raid on is socks. I bought a ridiculous amount of these cotton rib socks and they are currently $8.50. Now, moving on to our next brand is Everlane. Everlane is a great place if you guys want to get high quality basics made out of cashmere's or marina wools They are currently running a 50% off sale Some of the best items that I found here are the cashmere crew necks 102 dollars for cashmere crew neck is a fantastic price as you guys know for my previous videos cashmere is extremely expensive It's also the softest fabric you can wear another item that I personally have in my collection is the felted marino half zip sweater This is on sale for $95 if you guys want texture this definitely has a good amount of texture There is also a beautiful felted merino polo for $90 personally really like this oak colorway If you're looking for a 100% wool cable neck crew neck this one is a bit on the chunkier side They're currently selling it for a hundred and seven dollars now the next brand we have is Reese now Reese isn't currently running their sale at The time of this video, but it specifically says on their website there they're gonna be running it from Thursday to Monday, and it's gonna be 25% off their full price items. So some really good items to look out for on Reese is mainly their jackets. Their basics can kind of be overpriced, but they have a really nice selection for jackets. So for their jackets, the first jacket option that I'm actually keeping my eye on is the Merisin Patch Pocket Quilted Jacket. This is the ideal jacket for somebody who needs something thicker, because it's really cold, but still wants to get a more dressy, refined look. Another jacket that can give you a very similar look is their Quilted Wool Blend Taring, and fur jacket. If you're looking for something thin because you live in a warmer climate, you can look at the interlock funnel neck jacket. Super stylish. Also, if you haven't picked yourself up a hybrid knit cardigan yet, we can assume that the hybrid quilt and knit zip through jackets are also gonna be on sale. Final item that I'd recommend looking at at Reese is their textured side adjuster regular fit trousers. You guys are always asking me for alternatives to the suit supply ones. Here's an alternative and actually the navy ones are already on sale. Our next brand is, let me use it. I don't know why I said it like that. I just feel like Tommy Hilfiger should be pronounced. I'm gonna break back. I've been dropped here in ages, but honestly they have some pretty sick stuff when I was looking at their website. So they're currently running an up to 70% off sale. They have this really nice organic cotton cashmere polo. Huge fan of this one in the white actually. I have it in my cart. They also have some 100% wool half zips for $74.50. I also really like this cotton solid logo quarter zip sweater specifically in the blue colorway. I'm a blue guy as you can see. If you're looking for an affordable gelé, they have this lightweight packable vest for $49.99, and it comes in a bunch of different color options. Final item that I like here is this Monotype Logo Stripe quarter zip sweater. Typically not a big fan of logos across the chest, but this one actually works really well. Now before we move into our next item, I'd like to share with you guys this amazing toothbrush from today's video sponsor, Succas. I bet you've never seen a toothbrush or water flosser like this before. This is the Succas Nios 2. It's actually a two in one brush and flosser, so I can go straight from brushing my teeth into flossing without switching my tools, which is absolutely perfect because a lot of us have skipped flossing before just because it's another step that we need to do. So this is perfect. It's also super portable. It only weighs 225 grams, so it's super easy to just toss into your bag for trips. It's also way more powerful than you'd expect. It blasts away over 35 times more stains and 100% of plaque with this 0.6 millimeter ultra fine water stream getting into all those tight spaces and keep everything nice and fresh. And I know you might be wondering If it's a two in one, the water pressure isn't going to be as strong as a normal water flosser. And that's where you're wrong. The Nios 2 actually has 124.31 psi of water pressure. So it's 20% stronger than the highest setting on a water pick. The battery is solid too. 30 days of a single charge and it's magnetic. So no messy cords. Plus they offer a two year warranty. So it's definitely built to last. So if you guys are looking to step up your routine, the Nios 2 is a super solid pick, especially with Black Friday here. It's a great time to pick up gifts for yourself or for family members at the best price. Let's get back to our video. Next, we have one of my favorite brands of all time, Ralph Lauren. Now Ralph Lauren currently isn't running their sale like Reese and they will be running it later on in the week, I imagine Thursday will probably be around the same time, but they typically run 25 to 30% off sales, so this is a perfect time to get your cable knit cashmere sweaters, whether it's your quarter zips or just the crew necks. They're gonna sell out for sure. One item that I personally picked up stupidly Before Black Friday was this Gailene down vest. I really like this one. Nice and slim, it's tailored. I also really like this contrast wool panel sweater that I bought recently as well in the brown. You guys saw it in my last video. And the final item that I'm gonna be looking at is the mesh knit cotton mock neck sweater. I really love the color detail on this one. Moving on to Abercrombie. Abercrombie is currently running 25% off for their Black Friday sale. Now there's not too much that interests me at Abercrombie, but I will say I always make sure I pick up some of the hoodies and the joggers. The hoodies and the joggers that you see me wear at the gym are the ones from Abercrombie. So 25% off, confident. Now the next brand we have is Mango. Now Mango is running an up to 50% off discount for their Black Friday sale. However, I will say that most of the nice stuff is not up to 50% off, they're much smaller. But two that have a decent discount that I really like are the Green Polo Collared Wool Sweater. I wore this in one of my recent videos. Love this sweater polo and it is 23% off. And then you also have the Ribbed Wool Knit Cartigan which is 25% off. Now the next place is gonna be for the people that wanna pick up a new backpack or maybe a duffel bag. And that is the Coach Outlet and the Coach Store. Now, just to educate you guys real quick cause some of you probably don't know this. The Coach Store and the Coach Outlet have different products meaning that the Coach Store stuff that doesn't sell does not go to the Outlet Store. The Outlet is actually selling products that are made for the outlet. That's why they can have the discounted price. It's not the same quality as the Coach Store. It's a common misconception. So if you've been looking for a new duffel bag or a new backpack and you wanna buy something from the coach outlet, you have the Ventura Duffel Bag, super sleek duffel, $230, fantastic price. If you've been wanting a backpack, the Sprint backpack is on sale for $250, super stylish as well, and then the Warner backpack for $230, another great pick. Now the actual coach store is doing a 40% off holiday sale. A lot of the things on their website are not actually on sale though, just certain colorways of certain items, but that might change as we get closer to Friday. So the ones that are on sale right now that I really like. The hitch backpack is 30% off. It's only in the green colorway though. I have the brown version of this one. Super nice, sleek backpack. We also have the Gotham Duffel, which I also do have the brown version of this as well. I'm a brown guy and a blue guy, what can I say? But the green version of this, which is really sleek as well. I think this would be my second choice for color, is also 30% off. And the final brand is Essence, and they are currently running an up to 50% off winter sale. And there's only one item that I wanted to focus on on this entire website, cause there's way too many things to look through here. That is the Axelarigato boys. All of the Axelarigatos, pretty much all the models, the Clean 90s, the Dice Lows. So if you've been wanting to pick them up, they're on sale right now between the percentages of 25 to 50% off. The Clean 90, white version is all in stock right now. So if you've been waiting for that one, pick it up right now, because after this video it is sold out, I promise you. So guys, that is all I have for you today. Like I said, I tried to get this out as quickly as I could. So I apologize if I missed out on some of the sales, but I can only do so much guys. I hope you enjoyed it and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you."

        "transcript": " The single most foundational item in building a sick fall winter outfit is your knitwear. Now whether you're gonna wear your sweaters by themselves or you're gonna layer on top of it is essential that you have a wide selection of knitwear to choose from, which is why I have searched far and wide vastly to find the best knitwear on the market that you can purchase right now. From affordable brands like Abercrombie, Mango, Massimo, Dootie, Banana Republics who are more premium brands like Suitsupply, J Crew, Luca Filoni, Ralph Lauren. And as usual, everything will be linked in the description below and for your reference, I'm 5'8\", 150 pounds and I'm wearing a size small and everything. No lying today boys, that's my actual size, unfortunately. So starting off with our ribbed crew neck options first. We have this Pima Cotton Rib Nits sweater from Abercrombie. These are very well fitted. The texture from the ribbing is fantastic. She's obviously gonna love it too. This is a very thin sweater, so it can easily be layered on top. However, as you can see, it is quite thin, so it's not gonna keep you warm by itself. It's definitely something you need to layer on or if you live in a warmer climate, you can wear it by itself. Next up, we have a nice thick, ribbed wool crew neck sweater from Suit Supply. This one you guys have seen on the channel plenty of times before. It's got a fantastic fit, is nice and heavy, so it's gonna keep you warm and it is incredibly soft. Next up, we have something with some slightly different texture. This is an incredibly soft crew neck sweater from Mango, which is called the Wool and Alpaca knitted polo sweater. Not sure why they call it a polo sweater. It sure as hell does not look like a polo sweater to me. But it's a very interesting looking sweater. It comes in this light gray colorway as well as an off-white. And because it is this blend of wool and alpaca, you get this really nice hairy texture. It sounds odd to say a really nice hairy texture, but it does look quite good, doesn't it? It's definitely something you don't wanna see in your chick's chest, but it looks good on the sweater. Moving on, we have another similar sweater. This is called the Brushed Wool Brown Crude Act from J.Crew. This is a gorgeous sweater. I've been getting plenty of compliments on this sweater out of all the other knitwear that I have. The fit on this makes me look like fucking Arnold first of all. And the texture is just an absolute chef's kiss. This specific crew neck also has the ability to be rocked as a more formal crew neck as well. And speaking of formal, especially with all the holidays coming up and the holiday parties, you'll want a cable knit crew neck. And this one here is a cable neck crew neck from J Crew. It's super thin, but it's made of cashmere. So it's gonna keep you nice and toasty. And it's the ideal sweater to be wearing for a more formal event. Now, if you're somebody that doesn't like as fitted garments and you want something a bit looser, Abercrombie has their marled oversized crew neck sweaters, which have that subtle texture, and these are incredibly soft. Now, if you're not a fan of textured knits, which I wouldn't understand why you wouldn't be, especially watching my channel, we have suit supplies, pure wool, or pure cashmere crew necks, which come with just the subtle ribbing on the collar and the cuffs, which give that sweater a really nice detail. [\"Cardigan\"] Moving into our neck sweater, the cardigan, not this one, not the shit in your diaper cardigan, We're talking fully button cardigans or zippered cardigans. Now this gorgeous zippered cardigan you're seeing here is from Massimo Dutti. This is a wool blend zip up knit cardigan. And as you can see is extremely elegant zipped up or even down. And again, this item also includes the subtle ribbing details, which I love on the collar and the wrist. It just is a super nice touch to these items. Another option we have for the texture fiends is the chunky knit ribbed sweater with zip, which I actually gave away to a friend before I filmed this for YouTube, totally forgot. I apologize. I did have it though, but this one is super sick. It is heavy weight, it's chunky, but it's still well fitted. It's an excellent choice for a sweater. Now, moving into our button cardigans, you have this ribbed knit wool cardigan from Mango. Super easy to style, whether you want to throw it under a jacket or by itself, you're always gonna get a refined look with this particular one. Now we also have a very similar one made out of cotton boucle from Banana Republic if you want to get more ribbing texture. If you're into cable knit, You can pick yourself up this one, which is from J Crew. This is the Heritage Cotton Cable Knit Cardigan sweater polo. Super cool details on this one. And if you don't care for a formal look at all, you can go for this crop stitched sweater shirt jacket from Abercrombie. As the name suggests, it is cropped, so you're gonna have a slightly higher cut. Definitely a more casual item, but you can rock this nicely with a pair of jeans. So before we move into our next knitwear item, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, Intel. Staying organized, getting things done. Super important for me, as well as it should be super important for you. And recently I've been using an Intel AI PC, which has been a huge help with doing those things. It has what's called Microsoft Copilot, which is basically like having your own personal assistant at your desk. I've been using it to make me quick to-do lists, brainstorm ideas, and to just keep everything organized, make schedules for me. It's also got AI tools for photo editing, like Photoshop or Lightroom. Sometimes those softwares are very difficult to learn and tedious, but the AI tools make photo editing super easy. I can adjust lighting and backgrounds within seconds. The laptop itself is the Dell XPS 13, so it's super sleek, lightweight. It's got an OLED screen, which makes everything look amazing. It's also got a fantastic battery that's gonna last you all day long. But this AI PC isn't just for creators like myself. This is useful for everybody. So if you're looking to boost your creativity, productivity, and security this holiday season, check out the Dell XPS 13, powered by the Intel Core Ultra. It's an absolute game changer. Let's get back to Park Bidgin. Moving into our next sweater that everybody needs in their wardrobe is the Beloved Quarter Zip. The first option we have here is the Banana Republic Italian Merino Half Zip Sweater. This is going to be the best bang for your buck in terms of price to quality material because they actually are using a 100% Merino wool. Now our next option, a tad bit more expensive, you have Suit Supplies Merino Half Zip Sweater which is absolutely beautiful cut, minimalistic zipper detail, definitely one of the more refined quarter zips in this list. And one quarter zip that I've recently picked up that I'm absolutely in love with is this Ralph Lauren contrast panel quarter zip in wool. Because it fits so well, you think this is a thin sweater and it's lightweight, but it's not at all. It's actually my heaviest quarter zip that I own. The quality on this is immaculate and that padded shoulder detail really just makes this item stand out. Now another option that we also have from Ralph Lauren is the beautiful cable knit quarter zips. They have them both in cotton and in cashmere. So you can choose depending on your budget. They come in a plethora of different colorways, which is fantastic. But with these, I would honestly wait about a week or two to see what the Black Friday sales are. I do remember they went on Black Friday sales last year, but they did sell out super quickly. So if you don't want to take the chance, I'd probably buy them now, or you could take your chance and wait for Black Friday and potentially not go. And our final quarter zip on the extremely premium end, We have this beautiful blue cable knit cashmere quarter zip from Luca Filoni. This one is super thin in comparison to the Ralph Lauren ones, but it's still very warm. And just the blue color way on this is, chep's good. Now, moving on to our next knitwear item, which is the sweater polo. And by this point, I think all of you guys probably own one. If you have been watching this channel, you haven't bought one. What the fuck are you doing, mate? Look, I'm wearing one right now. Look at how freaking good this one looks. So our first option we have here is the khaki green Polo color wool sweater from Mango. Damn, I love this color. Pair this with brown, cream, white, beige and you're gonna be left with an outfit made in heaven. The wool blend feels excellent on the skin and this polo sits at the perfect length. Now our second option, very similar style but it includes ribbing texture which is the ribbed cotton sweater polo from Banana Republic. Third, we have this sweater polo, potentially the best sweater polo I've ever received in my life. Look at the fit on this. It's sexy. Was a polo, it would literally be this. I don't even have to tuck it in and it looks like this. Promise you, if you manage to pick this up, this will be treasured in your wardrobe. It is treasured in mine right now and I have so many clothes. Now another similar sweater polo we have from Suit Supply. This is the Off White Reagan Longsleeve. This one is a blend of wool and cashmere. It's still very soft and warm. This one only comes in this off white colorway so that is the biggest downside. It's just one color. Now, moving into our more formal sweaters, these are going to be your mock necks and your turtlenecks. Everybody needs these because there's going to be certain events that you need to go to where you need to be a bit more dressed up. So the first option we have is a ribbed 100% Reno mock neck sweater from Banana Republic. It looks to be as thin as that ribbed Abercrombie one from earlier. So this is going to be perfect to go under a gelet or even a jacket that's more slim fit. The second option here is the knitted sweater with wool structure from Mango. the same aesthetic just with a different pattern. This one is made with a wool blend. It is not 100% wool, so keep that in mind. Now if you want a thin 100% wool turtleneck, you can look at a pure extra fine marina wool roll neck turl jumper from Marks and Spencer's, offering some great value here for the materials used. Next we have the Suit-Apply Wool Cashmere Mockneck. I've had this one for the past two years. It is held up fantastically. Fabric is in great shape. It is is still fitting nicely, and I love that ribbing detail around the neck. And finally, if you want something that is more relaxed fit, we have this relaxed mock neck from J.Crew and Cashmere. This is gonna keep you very warm. This is the ideal layer for a cold day. And again, like most of the knitwear from J.Crew, this is ridiculously soft. So I hope you guys found something in this video that you actually like. Keep in mind Black Friday is coming up in about two weeks from now. I will be making a video then too, but just keep that in mind because some of these things might go on sale, but you'll have to be quick. So if you got some value out of this video, I appreciate a like and a comment, and I'll catch you boys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " It is officially trust fund fall, baby, which means you guys are gonna need a good selection of old money aesthetic outerwear items. We're talking beautifully slim tailored silhouettes that are guaranteed to get you tons of compliments from the single grandmothers, of course. Who else did you think I was gonna say? Single horny grandmas in your area, two kilometer radius. So in today's video, I'll be sharing with you guys what I believe are the best old money aesthetic jackets to be wearing for fall that aren't gonna make you look like you're 95 years old. And as usual, everything that I show in today's video will be linked in the description below as well as alternatives. And for your reference in today's video, I am six foot four, okay, maybe I'm five foot eight. I'm 150 pounds and I'm wearing a small in everything that you see. The starting off with one of my favorite jackets for fall is the hybrid knit cardigan. The reason this is one of my favorite items for fall is just because of the detail, the padded front, the knit sleeves, the backing. It's just so much texture and it's incredibly versatile. If you guys wanna get a casual look with this, You can wear it with some denim jeans, or if you want to get a semi-formal look, you can add some trousers. Now some options that I found for the Hybrid Nick Cardigan, you're about to have an orgasm right now listening to these words. Coming in at just over $100, these two that you see here are actually from Massimo Duty. Now before I could even finish that sentence, they're sold out. You guys already fucking sold them out. This navy and the black one are both from Massimo Duty, which is an exceptional deal. Just over $100 for an item like this. as I've discussed before, it's virtually impossible to find anything in this price range for the hybrid knit cardigan. I also found this one, cotton rich zip up knitted bomber, which is from Marks and Spencer's as well. Now in the middle price bracket, you have the hybrid quilt and knit zip through jacket from Rhys, it comes in black, as well as this super sick soft gray colorway. And then moving into the ultra high end, we have the virgin wool bun from Grant's Saso. This colorway is gorgeous, much more reasonably priced in comparison to Aurelian jacket It looks almost exactly the same. You also have Ralph Lauren's purple label, hybrid knit cardigan for a super understated look. And then if you prefer flexing when you've dropped over a thousand dollars, there's always big boy, Moncler. Next up, we have the corduroy jacket. It is an extremely clean looking garment, especially when you pick one up in a darker color, like a black or a brown. It's got that classy rugged vibe to it, but it still looks refined when you pair it with some nice formal undergarments. Now the one that you're seeing right here is from Massimo Dutti. Boys, I'm super impressed with Massimo Dutti. I bought quite a few items for this video from them. And the fit as well as the quality is fantastic. So they're killing it over there right now actually. For some other options, we have the Harrington jacket from J.Crew with this sweet collar detail on sale on the site right now for $148, which is fantastic. Now, if you're looking for a over-shirt type look, you have this one from Mango, which is the corduroy over-shirt with pockets. And finally Ralph Lauren has their Belford corduroy jacket in navy and your typical beige color. I suggest not going for the beige one though, just because it doesn't look nearly as formal. Moving on, we have the Gillet, one of my favorite items as you guys know, I use it all the time and I get readies with me, it's just because it is so easy to use. You throw it on over a quarter zip, you throw it on over a crew neck and you instantly have a pretty decent looking outfit. Now if you are gonna buy a Gillet and you want to achieve the old money aesthetic, you wanna go for something that is made out of fabric rather than a nylon or polyester version. Go for cotton wool, cashmere, corduroy. Now the one that you're seeing right here is the Ralph Lauren Hounds To Double Knit vest, which unfortunately I sold out in my last video. Can find it at other places though. I did find it on Simon's. So if you live in America or you live in Canada, you can still pick it up. I'm not sure about Europe. I know on the American website it is sold out. So I'm sorry. You gotta be quick. But some other options are the Codden Ridge Zip-Up Quilted Jalai with Stormwear from Marks & Spencer's. John Henrick also has an affordable flannel vest. We also have the Hybrid Quilt and Zip-Through vest from Reese. And if you want something super thin, you can go for suit supplies, mid-brown, zip vest. Now getting up into the more hefty price ranges, we have the Canada Goose Garcin Vest Wolf. Personally, I wouldn't spend any more money on an item like this, but if you have lots of disposable income, you have the Arillian AUR1 body warmer. Now, before we move into our next jacket, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video partner Geology. As you guys know, we have partnered with Geology before. Last time we spoke about their award-winning skincare products, but not only does Geology sell amazing skincare products, They also are a 37 time award winner in skin, hair, and body care. And just like with the skincare, you can go onto their website, you can do the quick quiz and geology will create a custom hair care routine tailored to your needs. They offer shampoos for all various types of issues, whether you have dandruff, you have dryness, you have damaged hair, literally everything that you can think of. And their body wash, dude, mine is the Bergamot Jupiter scent and I absolutely love it. This is completely honest, this is the body wash that I use, it smells freaking fantastic. It's free from harsh chemicals, it leaves my skin feeling hydrated rather than stripped which is what you look for in these types of products. It's the same goes for their hair care products as well, always feeling hydrated after using the product and not stripped. Also if you are into natural aluminum free deodorants they have a few on their website that you can choose from as well. So if you guys are interested in any of geology's products you guys can use my code brand in 70 for 70% off your first trial set and let's get back to the jackets. Next up we have probably my favorite jacket on this entire list which I don't actually And that is the bomber jacket, but not this type of bomber jacket. This one is more trendy. It's more oversized. It still looks nice I'm talking about this one's more refined slimmer tailored silhouette. It's got the stand-up color looks more like a Harrington jacket Some reason most of the brands call this just the bomber jacket even though it doesn't really look like one This is the one we're talking about and these are extremely difficult to find in the lower price ranges because these are typically made from suede Which as you know suede is ridiculously expensive if it is real However, I have found some jackets that look similar aren't made from the same material, but you're gonna get similar look So the first option we have is this one. I don't even know how to say the name. It's spelled BVNARY men's cotton bomber jacket from Walmart of all places Walmart has this I can't find this anywhere else But Walmart has almost the exact same jacket what we also have something similar from the Banana Republic Factory, which is the honeycomb jacket and it's actually 40% off now mango has this suede effect jacket which has a zipper. So if you prefer zippers you can get this one from Mango that looks kind of similar too. Now as we move up in the price range we have the Harrington jacket in cotton corduroy from j crew. If you want some texture you can even get a British tweed bomber jacket from the house of Breuard in the charcoal herringbone colorway moving into our real suede option. Reese has this beautiful suede Harrington jacket in the khaki green and dark brown colorway. If Reese didn't charge me duty fees I would probably buy this jacket but because my duty fees would probably cost $400 is not worth it until I go to the US. And then we also have this Italian brand called Pini Parma which has some wool and suede options if you're wanting to splurge on a lifetime jacket. And I'm not even going to give it any more from this point on because it absolutely gets ridiculous how expensive these can go. Here's some insight from Ralph Lauren. Now moving into a very similar jacket but a lighter version of this we have the suede shirt jacket. Most of the time you're going to wear this to some sort of indoor event with with a beautifully thin sweater underneath. Now, mine that you're seeing here is actually a safari jacket. So it's a little bit more mature, more formal. The typical suede shirt jacket looks like this. Now, some alternatives that I found starting with the fake suede options. We have the regular fit jacket from H&M with the suede effect material. Mango also has a suede effect over shirt with pockets. Now, moving into our real suede options, we have the button suede leather jacket from Massimo Dutti, which looks gorgeous. I personally would have bought this one, but they don't have my size. And continuing into our more premium options, we have a suede jacket from Marks and Spencer's. And then you have this other suede jacket from Billy Reed. Now our next jacket is the quilted jacket. This is the closest we're gonna get to flirting with the grandpa cord. Now I will say though, these things are poppin'. You can find these everywhere. Mango's got them, J.Crew's got them, Ralph Lauren's got them. Now if you're going to the countryside or you happen to find yourself going to a polo match or you got a girlfriend that owns horses. This is something that you would definitely wear. However, the color you choose will definitely lessen that countryside look. Now, if you get a black over a navy and a brown, the black is gonna give you the more metropolitan urban look. A one you're seeing me wear here is from Ralph Lauren. And when you pair it with a crew neck and some denim, it looks great. And in terms of price ranges on these, don't spend any more than like $300 on something like this. There's no high quality materials used here. Spending more than $300 USD is just a waste of money on this jacket. Moving on to the overcoat. Now it's no secret if you're somebody who can pull this off, AKA not midgets like me, that overcoat looks bloody fantastic on you. Now if you're on the taller side, pairing an overcoat with a turtleneck, a mock neck, or a beautiful ribbed crew neck and some trousers, gorgeous combination. You're gonna be able to find these at virtually any store that you look at, but some specific ones that I have found that look fantastic are the John Henrik single coat, which is a blend of cashmere and wool. Also includes some polyester, so it's not 100%. J Crew has a ribbing tin top coat in a wool blend, which is 95% wool and 5% cashmere. So you get any good materials used in this one. Or you have the goat suit supply, which has plethora of different options for overcoats on their website. So I hope you guys were able to find a jacket or maybe a few that you're gonna wear this fall. Enjoy today's video. Please smash the like button and comment which jacket is your favorite out of all these. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " So lots of you probably wasted tons of money on items that didn't need to be largely invested into and some of you probably cheaped out on things that you probably should have dropped some cash into. And as someone who has actually had the privilege of being able to have both some dirt cheap items as well as some very expensive items, I now have the wisdom bestowed on me as to what is worth it and what is not. Which is why today we're gonna go through virtually almost every fashion item there is and rank it into a tier list of investments so that when you guys decide that you wanna go buy something you can reference this video and you can see whether your boy Brandon thinks is worth it. So today's tier board looks like this. We have four tiers starting from the very bottom. We have the low tier investment. Our price range here is from the 10 to $100 range. These are your basics, frequently worn items. We're spending a lot of money, doesn't provide any additional value. Moving up, we have the smart spending category. This is from the $100 to $300 range. These are items where mid-range spending gets you good quality, durability, as well as versatility. The third tier, we have premium picks. This ranges from the 300 to $800 range. These are high quality investment pieces that are essential for those who prioritize craftsmanship and materials. And our final tier is the big splurged tier. This is 800 plus. And these are gonna be your cornerstone pieces that actually justify their high price tags through superior materials, craftsmanship, and their timeless appeal. So now that we've covered these tiers, let's rank these guys. Some of you guys definitely just got some PTSD about the last tier. It looks more like Drake than Drake himself. We have the epitome of a Ralfor. Hold on, legal girls. Those are the curbsaw for 10,000s, girl. Ranking, yeah. So starting off, we have socks. Definitely low tier investments, something you're gonna replace quickly, get super dirty. Unless we're talking a dedicated crispy sock, of course. Maybe you wanna splurge a little bit more. Vicuna wool, cashmere, something that feels nice and soft. I'm kidding. Now, the Jalei, I would say, $100 to $300 can get you a gray Jalei. You don't need a cashmere or a wool version of a Jalei because if you're wanting to be warm, you just get a proper jacket. So you can definitely find some nice cotton ones or suede ones in fake suede in the $100 to $300 range. Next up, we have the hoodie. Now the hoodie is almost always gonna be made out of cotton. You don't really see anybody who's rocking hoodies made out of cashmere or wool. So I would say that you can find a great hoodie in the $75 to $125 price range, especially brands like Abercrombie that make very comfortable hoodies, as well as ones that look great. It is going to be in between the two categories between smart spending and low investment, but I'm just gonna put it into the low investment just for the purpose of this video. The Hybrid Knit Cardigan. Now you guys know how much I love the Hybrid Knit Cardigan. Nothing gets me harder than a Hybrid Knit Cardigan. So that being said, it seems that only high-end brands make these, which is really odd. You would think that the lower tier brands would make them, but for some reason they don't. It doesn't seem to be a very popular item. So that being said, I would say that this is more of a premium picks item is definitely gonna be in the $300 to $800 range. Now do I think it is worth it to spend that amount of money on this item? I think they are overpriced for sure, but considering that you can't get any good quality ones until you're in that $300 to $800 price range, I'm gonna have to put this in the premium picks. Next, we have shorts. Now, shorts, unless you're living somewhere that's hot all the time, is not gonna be an investment really, and in terms of quality. Most shorts look pretty much the same. So I would say that this is gonna be in between the low investment and the smart spending range. I would say very similar to the hoodie. $50 to $125 is gonna get you a perfect pair of shorts that will last you. So I'm gonna put this in the low investment, but again, it splits between the two. Next up, we have sweaters. And this picture kind of just categorizes all sorts of sweaters, mock necks, quarter zips, cardigans, turtlenecks, et cetera. All the different types of sweaters. Now you guys know I preach that you invest into your sweaters. Always look for a 100% wool cashmere because the whole purpose of a sweater is to keep you warm, as well as you want something that's comfortable and wool and cashmere are gonna provide both of those things. Now, it is not something that I suggest that you overspend on. $400 is gonna be the max you want to spend on a cashmere sweater because they do get ruined over time. They pill. It is going to happen. So you wanna keep it within the $100 to $400 price range. So I'm gonna put this in the smart spending because most of the time you're gonna find it within the $100 to $300. $400 is on the high end. Sandals. Now sandals are gonna go into the smart spending category. $100 to $150 is gonna get you a perfectly fine sandal that is not going to fall apart. So a bergen stock is what I'm thinking of when I'm thinking of a sandal. So that is gonna go into the smart spending category. Here we have a picture of a varsity jacket. Now again, just like the sweaters, the varsity jacket just categorizes all sorts of casual jackets. I'm talking things like your denim jackets, your twill jackets, corduroy jackets, varsity jackets, anything that's not gonna be any high quality material like cashmere wool, leather or suede. Now this is gonna go into the smart spending category because within the $100 to $300 price range, you should definitely be able to find some really high quality jackets. You're mainly looking at stitching and actual fit when it comes to this price range for these jackets because like I said, they're nothing special in terms of materials. Next year we have boots and this categorizes all sorts of boots, Chelsea boots, military boots, leather boots, whatever all the other boots are, Choka boots. So this is gonna go into the premium pick section because $300 and up is going to be your safe price range for finding something that's going to fit you nicely, that's going to be using high quality materials that's gonna last you a long time and that's actually gonna be comfortable to wear. You might be able to find something in the 250 range, but I think you have a safer bet looking in the $300 to $800 range for getting something that's gonna be good. So that is going into the premium picks. I want you guys to take a shot for every time I say high quality after this video. You guys be fucking blacked out by the end of this video, man. It's gonna piss me off how many times I'm saying this now. Denim jeans. Now I have both expensive pairs of denim jeans and cheap pairs of denim jeans. I didn't buy the expensive ones, I've got those sent to me. So I'm gonna say this unbiasedly. Denim is denim, bro. I know there's gonna be some guy in the comments like, bro, Japanese denim's so much better, bro. I don't think it's worth it. I'm gonna say $50 to $125 is the most that you're gonna wanna spend on a pair of denim jeans. So we're gonna put that in the low investment just because most of the price range is in the low investment category. So before we move into rating our next item, I'd like to say big thank you to today's video partner, Blumont. Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a quick hair styling video using their new rebranded line. As you can see, my hair looks atrocious because this is actually what it looks like when I just wake up. So for the purpose of this video, I didn't style my hair and check out their new containers, by the way. They are square now. And if you guys have used Blumont before, you're used to seeing it look like this. They've got this unique square packaging now, snap lock feature for opening and closing. And then they also stack on top of each other. Which is really nice for when you're putting them away. Okay, let's get into actually styling our hair. We are gonna kick things off with the volume cream, which is a pre-styler. You want your hair to be damp for this, and we're gonna get my hair damp real quick. So like I said, this goes in damp before you blow dry. This is gonna give your hair some volume, texture, and definition, which is really going to elevate the final look. So once you've applied it to your hair, you're gonna take your blow dryer to activate it. And this is a super important part to make sure that you get a nice finish. I mean, look, just already after the pre-styler, my hair looks a million times better than it did before. Now that it's dry, we are gonna go in with the matte cream clay. This is a post-styler, it's lightweight, so it doesn't feel heavy. Plus it's also got shea butter in it for smooth texture and a nice matte finish. And there you have it, this is the before and after. Super easy, tons of volume and texture definition. If you guys want to grab any of these products, you can use my code BALFOR for 10% off at checkout. Link will be in the description below. And let's get back to rating these items. All right, now we have the duffel bag. Now the duffle bag is something that you should invest in. Everybody should just have one nice leather duffle bag. Leather, not canvas. Don't spend your shit on some Louis Vuitton monogram canvas bag that costs like $20 to put together. You want something that is made out of genuine leather. So that being said, if you want something that is made out of genuine leather that is gonna last you a very long time, this is going to be between honestly premium picks and splurge. Now 800 plus, don't be looking at any designer brands. If you want something that's actually going to be super high quality, you're gonna want to look at something that is handcrafted. I would look at a brand like Frank Clegg. I didn't even need to look it up. Frank Clegg is going to be in that higher price range. If you want a one-on-one bag made or something like that, but for the most part, $300 to $800 is going to get you a great duffel bag that's going to last you a lifetime if you take care of it. So that is going to go into the premium picks section. Sneakers. Now sneakers, I do believe you should spend more than just $100 on a pair of sneakers, but you don't need to go overboard and go 300+. I have a pair of sneakers that I had sent to me because I had done a collaboration with Harry Rosen and the Brunello Cuccinelli are over $1000. Now do I think that they're any better than the Axlore Gatos at a $250 price range? Not at all. Shoes are going to get ruined regardless, but you still want something that's going to look nice, that's going to be high quality because they will last you longer, but they will still get ruined. So don't invest too much. I'm gonna put this in the smart spending section. Next we have the winter jackets. These are your parkas, your bombers, your down-filled jackets that are meant to keep you warm. If you were somewhere that gets extremely cold is definitely worth it to invest in a winter jacket. Winter jackets that have down-filling, most of the times are coming from higher-end brands like Canada Goose, Montclair, where I know Canada Goose, I'm not sure about Montclair, but Canada Goose has a lifetime warranty with their jackets. So they are worth it in terms of actually keeping you warm. and lasting you a very long time. So I would say that you're gonna be looking from the $500 to $800 range to get yourself a jacket that's gonna last you a long time. This is an investment for sure. And that is gonna go into the premium picks section and between the splurge as well. T-shirts, low investment, Uniqlo, $30 for a T-shirt. And it's something that you just constantly replace very quickly, because they get ruined fast. Belts is another one that I wouldn't say it's necessary to spend a ton of money on a belt. between $50 to $120 is gonna get you a genuine leather belt. So that is gonna go in the low investment as well. Next up, we have the Taylor Trouser. Now out of this entire list, I would say that the Taylor Trouser is the most important thing to invest in. If you guys watch my content, you know how many people talk about my pants, all my suit supply pants, everybody's always commenting on them because they look so good. They fit perfectly. That's the beautiful thing about a custom Taylor Trouser is you can spec it out to whatever you'd like it to look like as well as to fit your body perfectly. A pair that I bought two years ago looks exactly the same way it did when I first bought it. It is basically indestructible. I don't even think Wolverine's claws could cut through the material. It will last you a lifetime, guys. So I would say that this is gonna go into the premium pick section. 250 to $400 is gonna get you a fantastic pair of tailored custom trousers. Okay, now we have dress shoes. These are your monk straps, your oxfords, loafers, all the different types of dress shoes. you want to spend a decent amount of money on these things because the cheaper ones are always gonna hurt your feet and they're just not gonna last. I would say that this is gonna go into the premium pick section. You're gonna wanna be spending around $300 to $800 on a good pair of dresses. And remember, you're not gonna be wearing it all the time unless you're James Bond. So it is something that will last you probably a lifetime if you spend a good amount of money on them. Now we have the button up or button down shirt. I would say that you can get a good quality button up button-down shirt for the $60 to $125 range. If anything, I'd be spending most of your money actually on the tailoring process of getting this shirt to fit you properly. Cotton is fine for a shirt. So we're gonna put this in the smart spending category. It also, like I said, you can get it in the low investment area, but just for the sake of this, we're gonna put it here. Next up, we have coats. These are your P-coats, your overcoats, your trench coats. Because it is so much material and you always with a coat like this, It is something that is gonna last you forever, is really a wardrobe staple that you can splurge on. This is gonna go into the 800 plus range because of how much fabric it is. If you're looking at wool or cashmere, it is gonna be in the upper 800s to $1,500. Don't go and spend 2K on an overcoat, but within 800 to $1,500 is a perfectly fine price range to spend on a high quality jacket. Man, dude, I can't say high quality anymore. It's pissing me off. I don't know, what other term could I use, guys? exceptional quality. Okay, now we have suits. Most suits that are made of fine materials are going to be starting in the 800 plus range. That is going to go right into the splurge section just because you're not going to get anything great nor tailored well for less than that. Hats, beanies, toaks, low investment, don't need to spend a lot of money on that. Polos, I would say you're going to be looking in the smart spending section just to get something that's actually going to fit you properly. You might be able to find some in the low investment as well, but most of the time they don't look that great under $100. So I'd say that anything between 100 to 150 is going to get you a nice looking Polo. Underwear, low investment, just make sure you go for cotton or bamboo to make sure that your Johnson is healthy. Chinos always going to be made out of cotton. You don't need to invest a ton of money into Chinas. I would say $60 to $120 is going to get you a perfectly fine Chino. So that is going to to go into the low investments section. This other one here, this symbolizes things that are made out of suede or leather. This is automatically going to put you into the premium picks section because it is the most expensive material that you can buy. It can even get into the splurge section, but I would say that once you get into the splurge section, you're paying a lot more brand tax than you are for actual material wise. I'm going to put that in the premium picks section. Definitely worth it for sure though to have some sort of leather or suede jacket in your fall or winter rotation. And finally, we have swim trunks, swim trunks, low investment. You don't need to drop a ton of money on it. $10 to $100. I even buy the ones from H&M. You end up going to a lake or something, you slip on a rock and you ruin them. So that's gonna go into the low investment, guys. So I hope you've enjoyed today's video. Let me know in the comment section if I made any mistakes or what you disagree with, and I'll catch you guys in the next video."

        "transcript": " There are particular brands that are consistent within my content and I tend to jam them down your throat because that's how much I believe in the quality that you're getting as well as the fit. However, there is one brand that seems to stand out a lot more than the others in my content. Buy a few brown suits, buy a few white pants. Well boys, we finally did it. We are collaborating with Suitsablog. But I'm not gonna be staying here for this entire video. I'm actually going to leave the apartment. I'm going to the LA location, which is gonna be my first time ever to LA and we are going to look at the new collection as well as they're gonna put me in some sort of outfit. So pretty excited for this, boys. I gotta leave at 3 a.m. though. I'm just gonna suck. So catch you guys in the morning. I got the hottest fucking pimple right here. What do you mean by like, what do you mean, significant? Dude, when you stand in front of the mirror, you like that, it like makes it look like it's like- It's like volcanic. Retrooting off my head. My boyfriend and I are on our honeymoon. Hi guys, we made it to LA. Absolutely exhausted. Thomas and I went to bed at I think 11.30 last night and then we had to wake up at 2.40am. So got to this hotel. We're probably gonna sleep for maybe the next two hours and then we're gonna go get get something to eat and go explore what LA has for us. So guys, we've just arrived at Suit Supply LA. We're going to meet up with our friend Brandon, who's going to take us through new collection. Let's head right in. So this is our friend here. You want to introduce who you are and what you do here at Suit Supply. How's it going everybody? I'm Brandon with Suit Supply. I'm going to be style lead for the West Coast. I take care of basically all the outfitting for our team, but also the styling that you're gonna be seeing today on our lovely Brandon Obey. Yeah, his name's also Brandon and he dresses better than me. Maybe he should take over the video. There. Put your fingers, bring her to the moon. Girls, what y'all trying to do? All right, how do we feel? Feels good. I'm not typically like a jean wearer, but these look really nice actually. Yeah, so these are actually gonna be our Charles Denham. So they're actually gonna be a beautiful straight cut on us. Easy way to dress it up a little bit more formal if you wanted to, like you have here with a nice Belgian loafer. Or if you wanna make it a little bit more casual, you can even wear these at the sneaker on like a weekend go to. Yeah. Oh. Change. This really well actually. So right off the bat, we have this beautiful bomber jacket right off the top. I'm saying right now, you have the cinching on the interior of the sleeve, so it's not gonna drop too far. And of course it's an outer wear piece, so you do want it to kind of just sit right at the top of the arm. It's a perfect length as well. Yeah, doesn't need to have anything else done to it really. Yeah, and of course we added it with the beautiful camel and crew neck here with a little bit of a thicker ribbing on the actual neckline So we get it almost like a mock neck appearance But it still stays refined enough to sit under a jacket or a bomber like this pop the collar if you want to showcase a little bit more Edge to the look and make people understand that you mean business. Do you mean business? Yeah, I feel like a freaking boss right now I imagine me walking in just like boom Sick and I love this cashmere sweater. Yeah, it's like one of my go-to pieces I have so many of these and then the jacket just fits perfectly as well I love that it's not like too long and typically fine most jackets are gonna have an issue with length But like right off the rack this fits really well and like I said, I'm a fan of the denim I'm not typically a fan of the denim, but these ones look really good. All right, so this is the second look So here we went with a little bit more of a more casual vibe for sure Especially adding in this beautiful white tank top with the double zipper come up a little bit show some silhouette pop that collar up in the back, and just add this knit over the shoulder to go with a more laid back wire. That looks fire, dude. Looking like you now. Yeah, man. Well, he knows how to style. That's the trick. The last trick you need in the book is throw the sweater over the shoulder. Yeah. So, we've just come back from the suit supply LA location. Absolutely amazing experience. store is super clean, aesthetics on point as always, and customer service is fantastic. Also, you guys wanna get a hem or a waist adjustment done on your pants. It takes about 30 to 60 minutes, which is crazy. I got mine done in store while I was there. Usually I wait an entire week, and they said if they have anything more extensive to do, taper, et cetera, you're gonna be looking at around three business days, which is still fantastic. So now what I wanted to do is actually build some outfits using their new collection, because no offense to Brandon Thompson, but I know that's not the way that you guys style yourselves so I'm gonna build some outfits that's more my style. Let's get building some branded Belfort outfits. Starting off with our first outfit I've gone with this great clean casual look. I've used their mid brown zip vest which is camel and it's made out of cashmere. It's extremely lightweight, nice thin layer. I've added it over top of an off-white marino ribbed crew neck for a nice texture clash. For the pants you guys have seen these multiple times now these are my custom suit supply wool trousers with the side to adjust her detail. And then for the shoes, we've gone with the light brown suede sneakers. Outfit number two, I've decided to absolutely break fashion rule 999. Don't wear black and brown together. Whoever said that's a idiot. It's like one of my favorite color combos to be honest. So what I've gone with is their dark brown bomber jacket, pure cashmere, absolutely beautiful fit on this jacket. It's got the nice cinching details as well. Carried it with another rib, merino, crew neck, but in black again, I'm wearing my custom trousers. And then on the feet, I've gone with a dark brown suede penny loafer to give this outfit a slightly more formal look. Oh, fit number three, another casual look. I've gone with their mid brown rib half zip sweater. Again, it's made out of wool and cashmere. Paired it with the dark gray straight leg jeans that Brandon styled us in. And then I've added some light brown suede sneakers on the feet. Now for outfit number four, Taking that sick black bomber jacket that Brandon had styled us in, added the black Merino ribbed crew neck underneath. I've gone with some off white denim. I've added their black belt to create some contrast. And then I've gone with the black suede sneakers. And now for number five, I've gone with the mid brown zip vest once again. And underneath I've added the camel crew neck that Brandon styled us in. I've added a belt and some off white denim. And then on my feet, I've gone with the black suede sneakers but this absolutely gorgeous color combination. So guys, I wanna say a big thank you to Suitsupply for sponsoring us finally. This was a match made in heaven. I also wanted to say thank you to you guys for making this happen. Because obviously without you, we would never have such an amazing collaboration. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, please smash the like button, drop a comment on what pieces that you like the best in their collection and I'll catch you guys in the next video."

        "transcript": " So today, you guys have willingly sent me in your outfit photos to be rated, criticized, and ranked into a tier list by yours truly. I apologize if you didn't make it into this video. I got a ridiculous amount of people sending me photos, so if you guys like and comment on this video and it performs very well, make it a promise and we will do a part two. So this is what today's tier board is looking like. We have smash in the number one category, which means that if your outfit was a chick, cheeks would be getting clapped for sure. Second, we have clean, which which just means your outfit looks clean or I would personally wear it myself. Third, we have almost there, which means you might need to change one thing, you might need to add something, or you might need to change the fit of your garment. And finally, we have needs major improvement, which is just what it sounds like, needs major improvement. So just remember guys, this is my personal opinion style is completely subjective. You guys wanted to be in this video, so I'm gonna rank things accordingly to the way that I like. Let's get into this video. All right, moving into our first victim. You know, and buddy's head is thinking, I know when the hotline bang, da da da, that can only be one thing. Buddy looks more like Drake than Drake himself. At beard is fresh though, I won't lie, I wish I could grow a beard like that. Anyways, the outfit is super clean. Proportions are perfect. The color choice is obviously great because it's just black on black. I like the loafers. The only thing that I would change with your outfit, dude, is get rid of the chain because you've gone for a more smart tailored look and then you've got a blazer as well. I would just get rid of it. Just go with your watch and that is a very clean outfit nonetheless. So that is gonna go into clean. Well done, that's a good rating for the first one. All right, next, we have the epitome of a Ralph Lauren boy. This is what I imagine when I think Ralph Lauren. You definitely got the aesthetic appearance wise. Now, for your outfit, I actually like your upper layers. Ralph Lauren polo, linen shorts work really well together. The one issue I have with your outfit is the footwear and socks choice. It doesn't really work together considering you have quite a smart look up above. I would just go with some non-branded socks, at least if you're gonna go with high socks like that. Don't go with the Nike socks. I know a lot of people tend to do that for some reason. I'm not sure why. And then as for your shoes, I just go with a minimal white sneaker, not Air Force ones. But apart from that, the outfit itself is actually really good. That is gonna go into the almost there section. You just need to change your shoes and it would be pretty clean. Another Ralph Lauren, dude. I love it. So this outfit is clean, dude. There's not much that I would change to your outfit. You got everything down. The proportions are good. Colors fine. The only thing that I would do is just tuck in the shirt, but the actual outfit itself is clean. So that is gonna go into the clean section. Okay, so we got an all black look. This is quite good too. There's nothing really to complain about this one. Ooh, you know what I just noticed? I noticed that you're not wearing a watch. So that is what I would add to your outfit. I'm not a huge fan of boots, but that's personally just because I can't pull it off. I think I look like an idiot, but you can pull them off. So I'm not gonna criticize your boots. Everything looks good except for the watch. So you're going into the almost there section. It would have been clean if you had a watch on. Sheesh, dude, everything is immaculately tailored in this outfit. Everything fits you perfectly and it helps that you're obviously in good shape. My G though, what are those on your feet? Those are the curb scoffer 10,000s, bro. As you're getting hit in the back of the head with those things, Jaws has absolutely left the chat. But apart from those curb scoffer 10,000s, I would rate this outfit very highly. I would personally go for a slimmer, more classic loafer. But apart from that, it is quite good. So that is going into the almost there section. If you had a slimmer loafer, it would have been clean for sure. Cause everything fits really, really well in the color works. All right, this guy was definitely on a date with his girlfriend and he's like, yo, I brought your ass to the flower patch. You gotta at least get a sick photo of me. So I'm personally not a fan of bucket hats. However, I will say because of the choice of the fit of your clothes, how it's more loose fit and the shoe choice, new balance 550s being a more casual sneaker, I think it actually works and it looks good on you. So I'm gonna put you in the clean section. I personally wouldn't wear a bucket hat myself, but it looks good on you. So this is gonna be difficult for me to rate, but I'm gonna try to put myself in the mind of a street wear guy, because I'm not a street wear guy, but I don't wanna be completely biased to my style. So, if I was a street wear guy, this outfit actually works, the colors look great, the proportions are good. However, I will say, is that a rubber band on your wrist? If that rubber band doesn't have any significance to you, and it's just a rubber band, I would stop wearing that immediately. It kinda reminds me of back in elementary, when we used to wear like, baby's bracelets from Zoomies. Do you guys remember that? It was around the same time as the Silly Bands. So that is my biggest critique. Get rid of that rubber band off your wrist if it has no significance, and change it out for a metal bracelet. To suit your aesthetic, I would also add some more rings. I'm gonna put you in the almost bare section, my G. Next. I was about to flame you, but then I realized it's not actually a graphic tee, it's just light coming through the window reflecting onto your shirt. I thought it was a graphic tee for a second. That changes my mind about your outfit. Your outfit is actually good. The proportions look good, colors obviously fine, just black and gray, and I will say the socks and the feet completely add to the outfit. Dude, you killed it. Now I'm kidding. I can't give you a solid rating because you got no shoes on and shoes can make or break your outfit. So you are going to go into the almost there section because we can't give you a clean because shoes can make or break your outfit. Ooh, elegant. Input some Jazz Music Ryder. It's gonna be perfect. So dude, I love what you've done with this outfit from what I can see. The colors are perfect. I actually like the cardigan in this instance. And as you guys know, I'm not a fan of cardigans at all. He pulls it off very well and it looks like you've got some sort of rectangular watch on your wrist which fits the aesthetic of this perfectly. This would be the first smash outfit but because once again, I can't see what you're wearing on your feet, it is undetermined, which can make or break the outfit. So unfortunately, Brodsky, you are going into the almost there section. Dude, this is my exact outfit. I literally have made this exact same thing. You knew I would rate this high. However, I will say it looks like you're trying to show off Your basilisk and your pants. Buddy, keep it in your chamber, Seekers. Dude, you don't wanna see that. Your pants are a bit too slim. That is my biggest critique with this outfit. The colors, everything else works perfect. I like the loafers. It's just your pants are way too slim. He's even got the tinted sunglasses on, that's hilarious. My biggest thing is the slimness. I'd add about two more inches to the width of your pants. For you, it would have been a smash too, but you are gonna go into the almost there section. Now, before we move into our next victim, let me share with you guys a skincare company called Geology Today's video sponsor. Now geology makes skincare ridiculously simple and effective. Rather than wasting a bunch of your money on products, you're not sure going to actually help you achieve the goals that you have for your skin. You can go onto geology's website, take a 30 second quiz, and they will make a custom skincare program for your goal. Now these days my acne is not as bad as it used to be. I'm more focused on the anti-aging side of things. I prefer to not have my skin flapping around in the wind, like a curtain when I'm older. So they created me a custom program around anti-aging using high quality ingredients like retinol, hyaluronic acid and nice cinnamon. But if you're acne prone, you're oily skin, you're dry skin, you have dark spots, dark circles, they will create a custom skincare plan for you. And one other thing that I really like about geology is that they actually label what step you are on in your skincare and what to do next. I know what I'm doing at this point in terms of what comes next, but for the average person or the brand new person to skincare that doesn't know, it's really helpful to have that. So if you're interested in geology, you can use my code to get 70% off personalized skincare trial set and there's also 50% off add-ons as well waiting for you. Now let's get back to rating these fits. Again dude, I can't see the shoes. Why aren't you sending me full outfit photos? Anyways, if I'm gonna rate it just from the Neesa, it looks all right. I would just add some sort of wrist accessory. You need some sort of bracelet. I don't know if it's necessary for you to add a watch with this style that you're going for. You look like you should be in the next Twilight movies is that Bella right next to you? That's gotta be Bella dude. This is like some Twilight field for sure So because I can't see issues you're gonna go into the almost there section as well Smash dude. That is the first smash out of boy. I am surprised that there's no granny panties laying all over the floor dude Come on, bro, but he's not wheeling. All right So again, we have the same issue as one of the other guys that we just went by Is the pants are way too slim dude and the fact that your polo is a little bit more oversized It just accentuates how skinny those pants are. Pants themselves are actually cool. It's just the fit of them So if you had about two inches more again, just like the other guy It would flow a whole lot better, but everything else looks good and you got all your accessories on So I'm gonna put you in the almost there section. I Don't know any underage girls, bro. Don't look at me like that All right, dude, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry There's quite a lot for us to improve in your outfit here So your upper layers are actually good. You got a nice leather jacket on. I like the black shirt that you got underneath. The biggest issues I have with your outfit are all underneath the waistline. So the jeans, the jeans they need to go. No more holes in the jeans, okay? And for the shoes, those are the like, the back to the future Marty McFly shoes. And they're not Nike Air Max. We are going to change out those pants for some black pants. We're also going to change out your shoes for a nice black slim axelari Gato. Now look at your outfit. You're pulling, you're pulling legal girls, bro. So because there is so much for us to change in your outfit to make it look better, you unfortunately are gonna be the first person that goes into the needs major improvement. Again, this is just my opinion style subjective. So if this makes you feel confident and comfortable in what you're wearing, till you're wearing it, don't change it because I put you in the needs major improvement, all right? This is just my opinion. This one, super simplistic outfit and you're just missing all of your accessories. You got no necklace on, no watch, no belt. Not that you need a belt always, but I'm just saying that you don't have any accessories on. That is what you're missing in your outfit. the clothes themselves are actually very nice. So just add some accessories. We're gonna throw you into the almost there section. Dude, I feel like you're about to whip out a silence pistol out of your jacket and just shoot me 10 times in the chest. Look, he's even reaching for it. Jokes aside, the outfit looks completely fine. You are gonna go into the cleaned section. Okay, this next one, super simple outfit, nothing to critique here. Maybe just tuck in the shirt, that's about it. So that is going into the clean section, just the black and white outfit. Ooh, I like this. I like the Swade Chelsea boots in the brown. And is that a plaid jacket? Or my eyes just playing with me. I like this outfit, dude. Smash. Second smash of the video. Just steam your pants, okay? I know they're brand new, but just steam them. Okay, immediately with this outfit, my eyes just gravitate towards your pants because you got some extreme baggage going on and it is super wrinkled. Now, so the first thing I would do, take your pants to the tailor, get those hemmed. That's gonna make it fit you better. Second thing, you are wearing an Apple Watch and it doesn't look like that's your workout gear. So don't wear an Apple Watch. It doesn't add to the style of your outfit. It's better to just not wear a watch at all than to wear an Apple Watch in my opinion. But if you can't afford to do so, get yourself a regular watch. You don't have to spend more than your smart watch that you got on and it's gonna look a whole lot better with your outfit. And another brother to brother conversation, this goes for everybody that's listening. His polo would look a lot better if he put on a bit of size. So if you're not already going to the gym, go to the gym, put on some size just in general. The better your body is, the better clothes you're gonna look on you because it's made for a mannequin that's usually in pretty good shape. So you're trying to make yourself look like the mannequin. So for you, just because we had to change a few things, we're gonna put you in the needs major improvement. However, I will say the colors and the actual items themselves are fine. It just needs to be tailored differently. This is super clean, dude. I like this a lot. The only thing that would change with your outfit, just because you've gone with lighter colors and this is obviously some sort of vacation outfit, you've got white pants on and then your Birkenstocks or are like this taupe color. I would go for a different watch, maybe a silver watch, or go for a watch that has a suede strap that's more similar to the color of your sandals. But apart from that, it's a very clean outfit. So this is gonna go in the clean section. All right, buddy, we see it. You've been hitting the gym. You look good. Keep going. Dude, you broke fashion rule number one. You never mix Nike and Adidas together. All right, that looks a whole lot better now. So your outfit is clean. Apart from that mistake, everything looks good. I can't criticize it. It looks good on you. We're gonna put you in the clean section. Well done. I actually really like this outfit. I like the color choice. Everything fits pretty well. I would just say tuck in your shirt a little bit better next time. And I like your watch too, dude. Super clean outfit. That is going into the clean section. Fuck. I had to look. There's nothing much to say about this outfit. Just looks like your average finance, bro. The shoes match the belt and the watch strap. It looks good, dude. You're going into clean. Okay, this one's pretty cool. I like the shirt that looks, I'm not sure if that's an Abercrombie crochet shirts or something, but an all white look looks actually pretty good. As long as you add texture to it and it's not just all the same texture, it looks quite nice. This is going into the clean section, got all the accessories, good job. Damn, now this is some style, smash! All right, gee, you're gonna let go of the tensing in your jaw, stop looking at me like that. Mr. James Bond over here. Okay, again, what is it with you guys wearing Nike socks and all these other brands? Let's remove that check mark. All right, now it looks pretty good. I love it God, can you guys just buy some socks that aren't Nike socks, like some plain socks? You know what, I'll do you a favor. I'm gonna put some plain socks in the description below for you guys to get. But apart from the socks, everything looks good together. I like the color choice and the shoes look cool too. So you are going into the clean section, my friend. Okay, with this one, I really like the color way. This looks very similar to an outfit that I've made before. Now the one thing I will say is when I'm looking at your pants, it reminds me of when the sunlight is reflecting off a pool and there's ripples in the water. I don't know if it's the dude, yeah, they're definitely too long. You just need to get these hemmed and probably steamed and this is gonna go into the clean section because apart from that, the outfit is actually nice. This one, plain and simple, just white and black. Everything looks fine here, nothing to criticize. You know what, with this outfit, I wouldn't say that I could pull this off, but it looks really good on you. And the fit of the pants fits well, even though it's a looser fit pants, It does fit well. There's not like too much baggage. And I like the salmon colored shirt. Everything works together really well on you, dude. I'm gonna put this in the clean section. All right, this guy definitely shops at suit supply. I know a suit supply polo when I see one. This might even be the suit supply shorts as well. I like it. I like it a lot. But again, I can't see your shoes, boy. This is gonna go into the almost there section because it is undetermined. That would have been a smash for sure if you were wearing some white sneakers. And that brings us to the end of today's video. I hope you enjoyed it. You had a little bit of fun with this video. I sure did. And if you want to see a part two, make sure you comment and like this video so it performs well, and I promise I will do a part two. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you!"

        "transcript": " Today, I'll be going through all the essentials that I would have if I was going to university or college from tech accessories all the way to style accessories. Now, I will not be going through your stationary goods. I assume you guys already have those, your pencils, your notebooks, and I will be accommodating for all types of budgets for every man we will have from the brokiest of the brok all the way to the ball and international students. And as always, everything will be linked in the description below. So, starting with the thing you're gonna put everything in, your backpack. Now this is a style channel and we tend to prioritize style over utility. So the aesthetics of this backpack is going to be important as well as the ergonomics to fit all of your tech binders and stuff in. So starting from cheapest to most expensive, some options that I've found, we have this one from Amazon called the Tuzwala Canvas laptop backpack. It seems to have lots of great reviews, lots of pockets, the colorways are quite nice as well. The next option we have is the Herschel Heritage backpack. It's a 24 liter and it comes in a very nice tan and black colorway, tan and navy, as well as the ivy green chicory coffee colorway. I'm definitely a fan of Herschel backpacks. They do have some quite nice aesthetics for the bags. Now if you want something that's a bit more stylish, clean looking, you can go for the Monos Metro backpack. They have a nylon version as well as this vegan leather option which looks amazing and it's only like a $25 difference. So if you have a little bit extra money I'd go for the vegan leather option. Now, if you don't mind spending a bit more so you can get a real leather option, we have the Hudson backpack from Coach Outlet for $229. Just make sure that you get a leather one and not the canvas one. Canvas backpacks are never worth it because canvas is super cheap. Just make sure you get the 100% leather one. And moving into our more expensive backpacks that these are only gonna be leather, we have the non-branded Parker backpack from Leatherology that comes in four different colors and it's about $350 USD. Now, money isn't an issue. You also have Graham's 28 backpack, which is their 151 Stealth backpack. This looks absolutely stunning. It's got the Italian pebbled leather exterior and it's got its signature buckle that looks very sick. And if you want something that's a bit more classy, you have the Coach Gotham Hitch backpack in this brown colorway, just so you guys know spending any more money on your backpack over this price range is not gonna get you any better quality. This is really as high as it gets. If you go anymore, you're just gonna be paying a lot of brand tax. So the next item you're gonna want is some headphones, specifically noise canceling headphones. I couldn't imagine trying to study and you just got all this noise around you, you're trying to focus and it's so distracting. So having a pair of headphones that are noise canceling are gonna be super important for your studying. So some great options starting with some serious value. We have the Soundcore Q35. It has hybrid active noise cancellation, 40 hours of battery life and a customizable sound app. It's an absolute insane deal at this price range. We also have the Sony WHCH720 and noise canceling wireless headphones, which are supposedly Sony's lightest headphones yet. So if you care about having a lightweight option, this is amazing. And moving into some of the more popular options for headphones, we have the Bose QC45s. I absolutely love these headphones. I had them previously and then they go stolen from me at the gym, but they're so comfortable. So if you care about comfort, these are absolutely incredible. the one con is they only have a 24 hour battery life versus a 40. We also have the AirPods Pro if you want some earbuds for the smaller form factor. It does offer some noise cancelling as well. It's not nearly as good as any of these earphones, but it can get the job done. And remember guys, you can buy a lot of this stuff used too. So don't think that you need to go and buy these brand new. Look on Facebook Marketplace, just make sure they're legit. And then moving into the top dogs, we have the Sony WH-1000XM5s, which are apparently some of the craziest noise cancelling like headphones and even the previous generation model, the XM4 is great too. And if you're super ballin' and you wanna be in the Apple ecosystem, you obviously got the AirPod Maxes, which I have. And I thought it was a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a pair of headphones, but then when I go at them and I saw how fast the connectivity was, like the second you turn it on, it's like instantly connected to all your devices and the noise canceling is next level. I was like, okay, I can justify this price, but for most people, not a viable option. Next up, we have the laptop case And especially if you are the person who likes to just take their laptop out with no backpack at all. If you accidentally drop your laptop, you're fucked because most of things in university, you are doing everything online. So you're going to need a good laptop and you want to protect it. Now some options that I found that are really sleek and stylish are the comfortable laptop sleeves from Amazon. It is faux leather, but it looks beautiful. We also have the moth laptop sleeve, which can expand and turn into a stand, which is pretty convenient. We also have this Nilkin 15.6 inch laptop sleeve case, which not only expands, but it also has a mouse pad that comes with it as well. Super useful. And then on the other hand, we have these other ones which are more style, more than utility. You have the full grain leather laptop sleeve from Leatherology. You can also get your initials put on it, which is a pretty cool option. And then we have Graham's 28 Italian leather folio case, which has lots of pockets for other accessories and chargers as well. Now number four is a camera for obvious reasons. The boys finna be making some movies. Now I'm not talking about that type of camera. I'm talking about a disposable camera, a DigiCam, maybe a Polaroid, something that is inexpensive because you guys are going to make a lot of memories in university and college and it would be nice to capture some of those things. That's one thing that I wish I did when I was younger was just take more photos to capture the memories because I've just forgotten about so many amazing times that I've had. So something really inexpensive like the Kodak Fundsaver, a Fuji film, quick snap flash. If you have a slightly larger budget, maybe you can get a Instax Mini or a Polaroid Second Gen or you can even get like a second hand DigiCam. And it'll give you that nostalgia vibe and a very small form factor. You can just snap away, just point and shoot. Next item is air tags. And if you're not into Apple, then you can go for a tile. But having these are essential just for anybody in general. But if you are a student especially, You're gonna be going to so many different places, so many different classes, and you're gonna bring your stuff with you, so you always wanna make sure that you have a good idea of where your stuff is. You throw it on your keys, throw it in your backpack, or maybe even one in your laptop for safe measure. Number six is a fragrance atomizer. Super clutch. Comes in a nice small form factor. Rather than carrying your 100 ml fragrance bottle with you, you can take this, give it some back shots, fill it up. And then once it's filled, throw it in your bag, and then throughout the day, in this nice small form factor, you can just apply it when you need to. Number seven is a foldable charging station. Now, if you're in the Apple ecosystem, this is catered towards you because this is for your AirPods for your phone and your Apple Watch. You can charge them all at the same time and then you can also fold it up when you are done with it. You don't need to have multiple different cords and especially if you guys are living in a dorm, having this on your nightstand is going to be extremely useful to have. Now there's plenty of options on Amazon at all different price ranges, so I'm going to I'll leave those in the description for you guys to choose from. Moving on to the next item is a tech bag. Now this is going to be essential for all of your cords, all of your chargers, especially if your laptop case doesn't have a lot of room to put this stuff in. Having this, even your foldable charging station, if you get one can go into this bag. Some options that I found is the Bellroy Tech Kits. We also have PGY Tech's Tech Accessory Pouch. It's waterproof, it's got lots of pockets. And a nice cheap one that I found is the Inatech Electronics Organizer for travel. And for the guys that just like leather stuff and they wanna spend more money, you also have the tech organizer from Leatherology. Or if you want something that you can actually attach to the side of your body like a sling bag, you have the Grahams 28 Theory Essential cases, all in different sizes. The next thing you guys are gonna need is a power bank, something that's strong enough to charge your laptop, your phone, and all your other accessories. So there's a certain optimal range that most laptops are gonna require for you to actually charge it, which is 62 100 watts. So one that I have here is the Shark Geek 140 power bank. And I just really like the fact that it's transparent. It just looks sick. But you can definitely find some more affordable ones from the 62 100 watt range, which I'm gonna leave in the description for you guys as well on Amazon. And finally is a toiletry case, especially for those of you guys that live in dorms or you're traveling frequently between campus and home, you're gonna want a bag that you can just throw all your toiletries in. And this is just essential for anybody in general. There are plenty to choose from on Amazon at all different types of price ranges. Bellroy has their toiletry kit. Monos has a very nice vegan leather one. And if you want a real leather one, you can also look at the coach outlet. So those are the 10 essentials that I would have if I was going to college or university. Now I probably missed some. So if you guys are students, please leave some other essentials that you would need for some of the other guys here to help them out. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " If you haven't already noticed, majority of stores have already started their summer sales to get rid of all their summer stock. They've moved into their fall 2024 collections. So if you're thinking it's way too early to start purchasing things for fall, good luck buddy. When fall actually starts, all the nice stuff's gonna be gone. I had to wait an entire year to get these Ralph Lauren quarter zips again. An entire year. I will not make the mistake waiting till fall again. And I want to make sure my audience, without dropping any of the other names about the other guys, I want you guys to get the best pics and then those guys can get her sluffy seconds after we're done our raid. And as always, everything that I mentioned in today's video is gonna be linked in the description below. So starting with our first item, the one that I waited an entire year for, the beloved quarter zip sweater. Now there's various different styles of quarter zips that you can choose from depending on how you prefer to dress. If you like to dress quite formally like myself, then I'd suggest you go for a cable knit quarter zip like these ones from Ralph Lauren If you do like these buy them right now, dude I swear that once this video hits about 50k, they'll all be gone. Like if you don't buy them right now, they're gone So good luck now if you're not a fan of the cable knit sweaters If you think it's a bit too formal for yourself Then you can go for some other textured quarter zips like the ribbed quarter zip or the waffle knit quarter zip And if you prefer a super clean minimalistic look you can go for a plain quarter zip Which can look extremely elegant as well Now the key thing with any of the sweaters that we talked about today guys, if you can afford to get a cashmere or wool option, get that over the cotton. Point of building a wardrobe is to make sure that it lasts. You don't want to have to go and rebuy these again next season. Now if you're in high school and you don't have the funds to do this, do not buy it. Always go for the more affordable option. Moving on to our next item, which is the gilet. Particularly the cotton wool, suede and cashmere ones that they are extremely difficult to find regardless of the time of year. The typical the nylon one is always pretty easy to find. The polyester version always has Zara or any of the fast fashion brands you can find them. And the reason for these other ones being so popular is that they're so easy and comfortable to wear. You can wear them in the spring, in the fall time without overheating. You can literally layer them over anything. T-shirts, long sleeve shirts, sweaters. There's a reason why this is the starter pack for the Finance Pro. It's ultimate versatility. So some options that I found that are really nice going from least to most expensive, starting with the John Henrik Brown Corderoi vest. Then we have the Hybrid Quilt and Knit Zip-Through Jollet from Rhys. The Ralph Lauren Hounds 2 Double Knit Jollet, which is the one that I have. Then we also have this Goat Suede Jollet from the House of Brewer. Suit supply has a zip vest and cashmere. Then we also have the Garson Vest wool from Canada Goose. Caramel AUR1 Body Warmer from Aurelian and the Galene Down Vest from Moncler. those last ones are obviously meant for the ballers. They're extremely expensive. Next up, a very similar item to the Gillet. It's basically the same thing, just with sleeves. This is the Hybrid Knit cardigan. These are extremely difficult to come by. I had searched far and wide on the internet and I can't find any that are like extremely affordable. They're all pretty expensive. So forgive me if you guys know of any that are cheaper and you wanna drop them in the comment section below for some of the guys here really appreciate it because I can't find any. The reason it's so popular is because you look put together when you put it on. You literally only need to wear a t-shirt underneath. You throw it on top with some nice trousers or a pair of jeans and you got a pretty elegant look. This is something that I can imagine Jason Statham wearing when he's not wearing his suit. He'd be like, Yeah, I'm gonna wear the hybrid coat again. I'm gonna fuck your bitch, I That's my Jason Statham impression. I've been working on that for a while boys. So at the moment the ones that I can actually find on the internet starting with the most affordable, like I said forgive me I mean, most of these are expensive. The Reese hybrid quilt knit zip through jackets. They come in multiple different colors, which is sick. It is not made out of wool or cashmere, but it's gonna give you the same look. Now, as we bump up in price, you're gonna have the Colin R. Nano down mixed media bomber from Maccage, which is rated up to minus five degrees Celsius. Next, we have the Canada Goose hybrid knit jacket. And out of all the ones I'm gonna speak about, this is probably the best bang for your buck. It is still expensive, but at least it is made out of wool and then it's got down feather in Canada Goose. It's known for their down feather and being like some of the warmest jackets on the market. So I believe this is the best bang for your buck. You're gonna buy one. Another option is the Moncler padded wool cardigan. If you really like Moncler, this is a good option for you. And if you have some serious bands to spend, we have the Ralph Lauren purple label hybrid full zip sweater for the true old money enthusiast. You guys are probably broke after listening to that spiel there. So please drop some affordable ones in the comment section. Now the next item that sells out very quickly are nice bomber jackets. Your cotton, twill, suede wool bombers, they're so difficult to get your hands on. I much prefer bombers with the collar rather than the varsity style collar. It's just easier to dress up. The varsity one still looks nice. It's just more of a youthful look. If you want to dress more casually, I'd suggest those ones. So some great options that I've found is the faux suede jacket and shirt collar from RW Co for the guys that don't have a lot of money to invest in real suede yet one for my guys that like the varsity style is the hybrid Interlock jersey bomber jacket from Reese. We also have the short-faced double wool Jacket from Arquette the single-collar short bluisin Whatever it's called from Uniqlo and a beautiful suede jacket that I'm looking at from theory is the wide zip jacket They have a huge discount on right now. So it is extremely tempting to me But I've spent a lot of money recently So I'm gonna hold off a little bit and you also have a black wool bomber jacket from suit supply Sandro Paris as usual have beautiful tailoring in this area with their zip up jacket now before we get into our next item I wanted to share with you guys a clothing brand that I recently stumbled across called cotton today's video sponsor They are an ethically sourced and sustainable clothing company. This isn't gonna be your boring regular integration You guys will actually want to stick through and watch this because they sent me five really sick items that we're about to dive into So the first one, starting with a pair of pants that we all obsess over, that's right. We found another police say pants alternative boys. Look at these. This is their ribbed Nile ribbed pant. It's so freaking comfortable. It offers a very similar comfort to a pair of sweatpants. I'm going to be wearing these on the plane all the time when I go travel. It has the beautiful ribbed texture. It's got drawstrings on the inside that allow for a nice clean look. It's also got this two pocket detail on the front here, which adds some really nice interest. Next, we have the Sunset Polo, which is what I'm wearing right now. It's absolutely perfect for our current season. Again, the comfort is insane. It's got a more relaxed fit. It's made from 100% BCI cotton. And something that I've never seen before is these pockets on the front of a polo, which is very interesting. I like it. For item number three, we have the Men's linen camp collar shirt, which is super sick. It comes in this Puritan gray. It's extremely easy to style with a pair of shorts or a linen trouser. It has a nice boxy, relaxed fit, which is exactly how I like my camp colored shirts. Number four is the Cairo linen pants in the natural colorway. It has a beautiful, relaxed fit, nice and lightweight. And if you guys have not been able to find a lighter colored linen pants, this is definitely a great option as this is an essential in every guy's wardrobe. And finally, number five, we have something to rock this fall. This is their Rugby Half Zip sweater in the ash and ivory colorway. It's a great casual item. This is definitely something you can catch me wearing for night out with the boys. And what I really like about these pieces is that when you touch them and you have them in your hand, you can feel that it's quality material that's gonna last you a long time, which is what we look for when we're building our wardrobe as I always preach. So if you're interested in cotton, you can use my code brandonbala415 to get 15% off your premium essentials. I'll leave the link in the description below. Now let's get back to our full items. Our next item is a sweater, which is the cable knit crew neck or the ribbed crew neck. So these are pretty difficult to find because people just love texture big time, including myself. Cable knit crew neck is absolutely perfect for your more formal events or business attire. You can throw a nice shirt underneath and have the collar popping up. And I'd say that the ribbed crew neck is a little bit more casual. You can wear these with a pair of jeans. You can throw yours your lay on top or your nice bomber jacket and you've got a pretty nice outfit. So some options that I found for cable knits. We have this one from Mango. This is a cotton one. It is their tennis version, which is pretty nice for the price. Tommy Hilfiger also has a nice slim cotton one. Moving into our wools and cashmere's, you have Ralph Laurence Cashmere Cable Knits for your formal events. We also have a felted Merino Cable Knit from Everlane. If you like a more relaxed option. Another similar Cable Knit Crewneck sweater we have from the Theory Outlet towards our top end. We have the Aurelian Light Beige Winter Button Sweater. It's not quite a crewneck, but it does look pretty damn good. I had to include this in here. We also have a cashmere cable neck crew neck from Fran. Now as for your ribbed options, we have the ribbed round neck from Mango. They've got a fantastic selection of colors and at a very affordable price. We also have another well-fitted cotton fisherman's thick ribbed sweater from Paula Janes. Everlane also has their no-sweat ribbed crew neck. If you want something fancy, something made out of wool, you have the wool city crew neck from Aurelian, and you also have a fisherman ribbed crew from Billy Reed. Our next item is the suede shirt jacket or the suede trucker jacket. It's basically a very sophisticated dressy overshirt. So if you are more into the streetwear aspect of things, this is definitely not going to be your cup of tea, but for the guys that like to dress a little bit more mature and elegant, this is definitely going to be right down your alley. Now before I share the options for these jackets, just know that real suede costs a lot of money. It's like a leather jacket. If you want a real leather jacket, it's going to cost you a decent amount of money, but It's one of those items that you purchase one time and it lasts your lifetime. So some options starting with a faux version first for the guys that don't have a budget. Faux means fake by the way. It's not going to be real suede, but it's going to give you the same look. We have the suede effect over shirt with pockets from Mango. Second, we have Zara's faux suede jacket for a more casual look. Now when we move into our real suede shirt jackets and trucker jackets, we have the Banana Republic suede trucker jacket or the suede over shirt from Massimo DUT, which is the one that you're seeing me wear right here. We also have this suede Eden jacket from Reece. You have the classic Ralph Lauren suede trucker jacket and shirt or even the Billy Reed patch pocket suede jacket. The next item that sells up particularly fast is actually a footwear item and that is the suede sneaker. Even some of the options that I'm gonna share with you guys, I can already see that some of the sizes are going. So we gotta be quick on these. A pair of suede sneakers is going to match so perfectly with all of these items that we've talked about for fall as well. It's something about the soft textured material that not only compliments the rich, earthy tones of the season, but also adds a touch of understated elegance to every outfit. So some of the options that I have found for suede sneakers are the Suit Supply Italian calf suede sneakers. I have both of these, one in the black and one in the beige. Both very beautifully crafted, comfortable sneakers. We also have Aurelian's Cambridge sneaker, which you guys saw in my footwear video. I just recently picked these up. These have been absolutely excellent as well. Axler Arigato also has some clean 90s that come in suede. Oliver Cabell has some affordable brown wax suede sneakers and then Massimo Dutti has some split suede sneakers on the cheaper end of things. Vegabond has some suede sneakers in their Paul 2.0 model and then on the high end we have the common projects which have some suede sneakers in the Achilles low version. So guys, those are all the items that I recommend that you buy right now because I guarantee you a month after this video drops, it's all gonna be gone. So if you made it to the end of this video, Please drop your boy a like and a lovely comment, and I'll catch you guys in the next video"

        "transcript": " So by this point, if you're up to date on my videos, you should have everything that you need to build a perfect summer wardrobe. But some of you, even with having everything that you need, you just don't know how to formulate the outfits. Or maybe you just want some summer inspo. Fair enough, it's me, Brian and Balfour. So today I've built 10 extremely clean summer outfits that you guys can copy that are guaranteed to get you guys the single moms and the grandmas. They're gonna be weak in the knees for you. Don't brand me all, he's lying all. And as always, I'm gonna leave all the links to the items that I wear in today's video in the description below as well as alternatives to create similar outfits. Let's get into this. So starting off with our first outfit, it's including shorts. Don't get used to it, buddy. There are gonna be many of these in here. So for this first outfit, I've gone with a black suit supply ribbed polo. Look at the fit on this. It's absolutely absurd. It fits like a glove. And just look at that beautiful texture as well. For the shorts, I've gone with these surprisingly really affordable green elastic waist comfort linen shorts from Boohoo Man. I'd say it's about a six inch length. Very comfortable, super stretchy. And for the shoes, I've gone with the black axle Arigato Clean 90s to match the polo. My accessories, I'm wearing the Tiso PRX, the main side Taylor cuff bracelet, and the gold Aegis Trilogy pendant necklace. Outfit number two, as you can see, I've gone with some serious texture in this outfit. I'm using the Massimo Duty linen cotton shirt, which is look at how gorgeous the material is. It fits so well, it's nice and comfortable, it's not super heavy. And then I've paired this with some white please pants from Boohoo Man. These are like the ultra poor man's version of the EC Miyake pants. I guess the job done though and they look quite nice. For the feet, I've gone with my Axl Arigato Rush sneakers to continue that more relaxed fit vibe throughout the outfit. And for my accessories, I'm wearing a chunky silver bracelet from Lupin and a main size silver frame pendant necklace. Now for this next look, I've gone with this real Mediterranean look with this linen over shirt in the Navy from Massimo Dutti. Super lightweight, breezy. Underneath, I'm wearing a benevolent wife lover, and I paired it with some suit supply linen trousers. On the feet, I've tried something new, espadrilles. I might be butchering that, but I think they're called espadrilles, and they're kind of sick actually. They got this rope on the bottom, it kind of looks like a suede loafer at the same time. Definitely fits the Mediterranean vibe perfectly. For my accessories, I've gone with a leather Orson bracelet from MainSight and the Aegis Trilogy. Penta-Nicholas, MIT's OPRX, paramedic 80. Now for outfit number four, We've gone with a smart casual look. It's given some subtle sailor vibes with this Massimo Duty Polo. Horizontal stripes definitely are not easy to style, but the fact that it's navy makes it easier because horizontal stripes are going to widen your frame or going to give the illusion of widening your frame, but navy because it's a dark color is gonna give the slimming effect so it kinda just cancels each other out. And look at the beautiful fit on this Polo. I think Massimo Duty fixed their sizing because previously their stuff didn't fit the greatest and it was a bit long, but everything that I bought from them recently seems to fit really well. Now for the pants, I'm also wearing some Massimo Duty beige cotton linen chinos. And to keep it casual, I'm wearing the Axl Origato Clean 90s in the white. Accessory wise, I'm wearing my Longines Dolce Vita and this silver Piper Link puff bracelet from Mainside. Oh, no. 5. I absolutely love this color combo. I've gone with the Olive Dribbed Polo from Mango and I've paired it with my linen suit supply pants. And to tie all these colors together, I've added my Orillian suede cambered sneakers. Yes. That's right, boys. ordered from them. If you guys watched the last video, I wasn't sure on a really, and I never purchased from them before, but because I hadn't, and a lot of you guys were interested, I decided to send it and just hope for the best. The hype's definitely real. Look at that suede. That suede be moving. So from the feedback that I got, is that as long as you actually get what you want, you're chilling, you're gonna be happy with your experience. The issues come when you wanna return it. So make sure you get your size right, and the item that you actually like. And for my accessories and this outfit, I'm wearing my Tiso PRX with my gold pendant necklace. Now outfit number six, I've gone with something quite a bit more formal. This would be the perfect brunch outfit. I'm wearing a blue slim fit linen shirt from Massimo Dutti. I've paired it with some gray chinas from Massimo Dutti as well. And I finished off the look with some brown suit supplies suede loafers. For the accessories, I'm wearing the Longin's Dolce Vita with a silver main side bracelet. Now, this next outfit combo is one of my favorites because it's so simple and it just always looks elegant. And that is a really well-fitted black t-shirt. This one is from Banana Republic. This is their premium t-shirt, I believe. And you wanna pair it with some white pants. In this case, I'm wearing some suit supply cotton trousers. And then for your feet, you want to add a beige suede sneaker. And the beige suede sneaker is the Aurelian Cambridge sneaker. Accessories, I'm wearing the Longin's Dolce Vita and the silver main side bracelet. Outfit number eight, I've decided to do something a little less formal for my street wear, guys. I gotta get at least one outfit for you guys in here. So I've gone with a black camp collared Okin' Fort Relax Fit shirt. Underneath, I paired it with a white lover, and then I've also added some Abercrombie white linen drawstring shorts. On the feet, I'm wearing some Axlore Gatto Dice Lowe's in the green, and I've also added a green cap from Abercrombie to match the shoes. And on my wrist, I'm wearing the main side Taylor cup. Outfit number nine, super clean. It's got the laid back look, but it's still got that pull up on your bitch and get her on my yacht type vibe. I'm wearing this lightweight, flowy, Cuban color long sleeve from Club Monaco. I paired it with a wife lover and I'm wearing some navy pinstripe cotton trousers on the feet I've gone with some suit supply suede loafers in the beige and on my wrist I've paired my main side Taylor cuff with my Tiso PRX and my ages trilogy necklace on my neck now for a final outfit I've gone with a vacation look. This is something that I'd wear pulling up in Greece I'm wearing a blue patterned camp collar shirt from club Monaco with a wife lover underneath and I paired it with some drawstring white linen pants from Abercrombie. To continue the flow of the outfit on the feet, I've gone with some Steve Madden Maven sandals. For accessories, I'm wearing a lupin silver chain bracelet and some bar pendant necklace that I actually got at the thrift store. So boys, go pick up some single moms and some grandmas now. You ain't gonna get denied wearing these fits. It's impossible. You look too clean. And if you enjoyed today's video, please leave a like, leave a comments underneath this video.

        "transcript": " Today, we will be curating the perfect shoe collection so that you always have something to match your occasion. We like our shoe collection like we like our favorite actors. Versatile. So before we deep dive into curating your perfect shoe collection, I wanna make it very clear. You don't need to go out and buy all of these shoes and you don't need to buy them all at the same time. I'm simply giving you guys suggestions for the perfect shoe collection, something that you can accumulate over time so that you have something that is versatile. Second thing, I will be including the importance value in the corner right here because there's certain items that you're gonna need to invest more money in because it's just not gonna last you if you cheap out on it or it's just gonna end up hurting your feet. And as always, all the links will be in the description below. Starting with good old reliable, we have the white leather sneaker. I believe the white leather sneaker is the first shoe that anybody should purchase in their shoe collection. And because this is a shoe that you're probably going to be wearing 80 to 90% of the time, I recommend that you guys invest a little bit more heavily into the sneaker. So some of the best sneakers in the white, slim leather sneaker category while having excellent quality, we have the Accelori Gatto Clean 90s. You guys know I have multiple pairs of these. You also have the Coyote Capri white sneaker, which apparently is one of the best in its price range for the quality and the materials that they use very similar to the common project, supposedly, which is our next sneaker, the Common Projects Killies, which has claimed its title for a very long time as one of the best leather sneakers. We also have the Oliver Cabell low, which is offering one of the best price points for a white leather sneaker that is high quality. And if all of these are out of your price range, you don't really care too much about quality. You just want something that looks decent. It's gonna last you maybe a season or two. Then you have something like Thursday boots, Premier low top white sneaker or the Aldo Kobe. The second sneaker is the chunky sneaker because although the slim white leather sneaker is extremely versatile for color, if you're gonna be wearing baggy fits or you like to wear something more relaxed every once in a while, even like myself, you're gonna want a chunky sneaker because if you're wearing a slim leather sneaker with something that's more relaxed or baggy, it's like having chicken legs and wearing the baggiest shorts in the world. It looks extremely odd. So the design is really gonna come down personal preference with these but some of the ones that I really like are the Axelore Gato Rush sneakers. Super clean, not everybody has these, I just bought them. They also give me about a two and a half inch lift so wearing these I'm six foot four now. I'd be doing the most. I'd be grabbing onto the frame of the door doing those TikTok thirst traps. Dude the ladies fucking love me now. We also have the Axelore Gato Dice Low which is basically the nicer version of the Nike dunks. Of course we have the Air Force One, we have the Air Max 97s, I'm also a fan of a few new balances, the 550s of course, and the 2002 R, and finally we have the Jordan One Retro Low. Number three, and this mainly applies to the classy boys like myself, you like to wear polos, button down shirts, trousers. Well for you guys, I would recommend that you get yourself a suede sneaker, and the reason I like the suede sneaker so much is is because it doesn't make the outfit look too casual. You can still maintain a dressy, classy look, but be wearing sneakers. And in terms of price range, I have not found any that are under $300 that are actually quality. I bought these ones from Banana Republic for $200, thinking that $200 is probably gonna get me a decent shoe. These are shit. They've already started falling apart within the first five wears. So I would say that you're gonna have to find something above 300. Some of the best options out there right now, Axelorigato, Clean 90s, I have a pair in the brown suede. There's also a brand called Aurelian, which if you guys are into the, is money aesthetic. You would know this brand. I've seen it everywhere all over Instagram. They have the Cambridge suede sneaker, which looks extremely nice. However, I don't know how reputable this brand is. I've never shot from there before. I've heard mixed reviews, so I'm not sure whether I should pull the trigger or not. But if you guys have ordered from them before, let me know in the comments below. But apart from Merilion, Suit Supply also offers some suede sneakers. There's also this other brand that I just recently found called Del Toro. They got some really sick stuff, which I'm gonna talk about later on in this video as well. They also have a suede sneaker called the Sardina sneaker. And then at the very top end, you have Brunello Cuccinelli. They have ridiculous amounts of options if money is not an issue for you. But if all of these are out of your price range and you just want something to kind of replicate the look, you understand that it's not gonna be the best quality. It's probably not gonna last you very long. Well, then you can buy the same ones that I bought from Banana Republic or you can look at the Massimo Dutti split suede sneakers as well. Now the next shoe is the dress shoe. And this is gonna be very opinionated on what style is best because there's so many different styles, loafers, oxfords, monk straps, et cetera. But for myself and I imagine most of you guys you're going to want a loafer. And chances are any of these companies that sell nice loafers are also going to have the other styles as well that are quality. Now, your dress shoe is definitely something you want to invest more money into because if you get a poor quality dress shoe it's really gonna hurt your feet, it's not gonna be comfortable at all. And a good quality dress shoe can last you years, like almost a lifetime if you take good care of them. So you're typically going to want two pairs of dress shoes, a black pair and a brown pair. Suit supply has great options for dress shoes. Grant Stone Traveller Penny Loafer is also very nice. You have the Charles Tywhit, a brand from London that has some quality saddle loafers and a brand that I desperately want to add to my collection which I mentioned earlier is Del Toro. They have these really sick X detail patterns on all of their shoes. So their loafer is definitely something I want to get into my collection. It's just the custom fees are gonna be ridiculous in Canada so I haven't ordered yet. And on the baller end, you know you're gonna get a high quality product if you're shopping at Brunello Cucinelli, Zegna or Ferragamo. Now for our cheaper alternatives and be warned, these might mess up your feet are the Aldo Sinclair and the Massimo Duty Penny Loafers. And number five is a pair of sandals, strap sandals to be specific. You don't need to invest a lot of money into your sandals, guys, you're most likely going to be wearing it to the beach, they're gonna get wet. So investing a lot of money into these is not essential at all. My personal favorites are the Birkenstock sandals. They look great, they're not ridiculously expensive. There's also the Steve Madden Mavens, which I've been showing you guys recently. It is the Hermes Dup. Suit supply has a dark brown slipper if you want something a bit higher quality. Del Toro also has some really sick sandals called the Amalfi Cross Over Sandal. And of course you have the Hermes Sandal at the top of the line if you want the status even with your sandals. The next shoe is the Suede Loafer, which is ideal for the summertime if you guys are going out for a nice brunch, for a nice dinner on a hot sunny day. This is definitely your shoe. I would say for investment, you can definitely get away in the mid-range section of price. You can get away with an Aldo Alto, you can get away with a Massimo Dutti suede loafer. Massimo Dutti even offers a wide range of different colors. However, I will say is nowhere near as comfortable as the suit supply loafers, which are slightly more expensive. If I was you, I would just save until you can afford the suit supply ones because they're so much more comfortable. I have four pairs of these, so you can trust me. The other alternative is Del Toro, which they have some beautiful suede loafers. I would love to get these. Like I said, I just don't want to pay an absorbent amount of duty fees. However, both suit supply and del Toro don't offer a wide range of colors in the medium range price, but you have the brand like Aurelion. Like I said, I've never shopped at Aurelion before, so just be careful. But they seem to have quite a few different colors that are quite nice. And then at the very top of the pyramid, you have the Loro Pianos, completely unnecessary purchase because the suit supply ones are exactly the same. But if you want the LPs, get the LPs, bro. So once you gradually get all of these shoes, I would say this is a near perfect shoe collection. If you guys disagree or you think I should have added another shoe, drop it in the comments below. Please like the video and subscribe if you enjoyed it and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you."

        "transcript": " In the past few years of my life, a loss has happened. I built a social media following of just under three million people across all my social media platforms. I've traveled to multiple different countries. I've had my family house burned down. I've moved into my dream apartment. I've even started to see my hairline receipt. So quite a lot has happened and quite a lot has changed. And over these past few years, I've gained some extremely valuable lessons that I wish somebody would have told me sooner so I didn't have to wait to learn them that I could just get them right away. Which is why today I've compiled eight extremely valuable lessons I wish somebody would have told me sooner, so that hopefully if you guys listen and you implement some of these things, maybe it can change your life as well. So the first lesson is question all of your beliefs. Now, I'm gonna give you guys a really easy example, but you wanna apply these same things to all of the other beliefs as well. So let's just use what is the definition of success as an example. From 99% of us, and I was guilty of this as well, when I thought of the successful life, I thought of mansions, supercars, women, luxury travel, shopping sprees, right? A lot of us think that that's what success really is and it's easy to believe that because that is what social media glamorizes, but is that actually what success means to you? Maybe success isn't any of those things. Maybe success is just being able to wake up every single day and truly enjoy what you're doing, genuinely have interest in what you're doing. Maybe it's you're a father and a successful life to you is raising kids that you can actually be proud of. Maybe success to you is just actually giving yourself up to God and fully accepting Him into your life. Maybe success is just being able to be yourself. You're not having to put on a facade. You are extremely genuine and authentic. Maybe that is what success is. So the main point is to align yourself with your own thoughts and your own definitions. You don't wanna end up going through life, believing something, just to waste a bunch of time trying to go and chase those things. And then you finally end up getting there and it just leaves you completely empty and unfulfilled. So always question what you believe. Second lesson, be kind and generous to everyone you meet. Now, it seems like it is so common sense, but I promise you 99% of people walk around so fucking selfish. They don't care about anybody else but themselves. They don't bother to remember people's names. I am always forgetting people's names. They don't ask people how they're actually doing. They don't give genuine compliments. They don't do that. 99% of people don't do that. So when you are genuinely interested in somebody else, you ask them questions, you give them genuine compliments, to remember their names. This amazing thing happens because it is so rare. All of a sudden, they're like, I really like this guy. I'm gonna start doing things for this guy because I like him. All of a sudden, you're getting reservations at restaurants that are fully booked. The tailor's getting your clothes done before anybody else's, even though they came before you. You're going to the fast food restaurant, they're putting more food on yours than anybody else's. Concierge downstairs is coming all the way up to your door to hand deliver packages. These are experiences that I've had just from being kind, generous, and genuine person and being interested in other people. It's an amazing thing that happens and you don't do it for that reason. You just do it because that's a good thing to do, to be a kind person, but you get all of these benefits from doing it. You will never experience anything negative from being a more kind and generous person. Lesson number three, 99% of people will not believe in you unless they have done something extraordinary themselves. Don't expect people to believe in you guys. When you go and you say you wanna do something that most people have never done, they've never even thought of doing before. They're not gonna believe in you, and they're most likely going to say something negative because it's this weird self-projection thing that happens because they personally don't believe that they would be able to achieve it themselves. They say you won't be able to do it, but it's just this projection. It's their own insecurity. It actually has nothing to do with you. Like I said, it's them actually thinking that they couldn't do it themselves, that they're gonna say, yeah, that's probably not gonna happen, man. That's so unrealistic. So the main point of this lesson is do not tell anybody about your ideas. Don't tell anyone unless they have either done it themselves or have done something extraordinary themselves as well because only they will understand that anything is actually possible if you give it enough effort, enough focus and you find the right people. Lesson number four is health needs to be a number one priority over everything. Let's take Dana White for an example. The president of the UFC from an outside perspective like we were talking about earlier with the success thing, you would think that this guy has absolutely everything. He is a massive company, billionaire. He's obviously got lots of nice cars and homes and he gets lots of women as well. So Dana wanted to check out his health one time. So he reached out to a guy named Gary Breckel, who's a very popular guy in the health industry. And Gary took Dana's blood and analyzed his blood. And from analyzing Dana's blood, told Dana that he only has 10.4 more years to live in his life. down for three hours and told me every single thing that was wrong with me. Dana was 52 years old at the time so that would bring him up to 62 years old. You think for a millisecond Dana was thinking about all of his accolades, the money he's earned, the fame, the status. There's not a fucking chance he was. He was just thinking holy crap I have 10.4 years to live. I'm only living till I'm 62. And what I find a lot of people do including myself is we start to get lazy on our health when we start to achieve more. You start to gain some momentum in your career and you crave that more and more. So rather than cooking a healthy meal at home, you start ordering Uber Eats because you're too lazy to cook. You want to spend all the time working or you stop going to the gym as often because you want to get in a few extra hours of work and you're like, ah, an hour and a half at the gym. I could trade that for working and I could be more productive. And what we need to remember that when we're doing this, we're actually preventing ourselves from operating at the highest level. You're more tired. You can't think as clearly. And eventually you do it for so long that you have some serious health problems like Dana. I couldn't bend over to put my socks on because my legs were so screwed up. I would wake up in the middle of the night and throw up almost every night. There's this extremely popular quote from Confucius and it goes like this, a healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one. Once you're sick, there's nothing more that you want than just to be healthy again. So remember that when you decide that you wanna eat unhealthy, you wanna skip the gym. Just remember, health is the most important. You can't achieve much if you're dead. Lesson number five, the nuances of life will typically be the best lessons will make you the strongest and are gonna be the most memorable. So like I said at the beginning, my house had burnt down this year. So this is a great example of how there can be beautiful lessons that come out of a terrible situation. So my house, to give you guys backstory, was burnt down because of my neighbor's hot tub. It ended up taking them both of our houses. Wasn't even our fault. And now our insurance company is really screwing us over as well. So it has not been an enjoyable experience on that end. One of the most beautiful lessons that came out of it was, I realized how little materialistic possessions matter at all. The only thing that mattered after my house burnt down was my family, my friends, and my community. The other lesson that I learned was, it actually restored my faith in humanity. We had so much help from neighbors, from people we didn't even know were donating to help us. It was this beautiful experience that I guess even myself didn't think like anybody would do that for us. And it was really eye-opening experience. and I'm like, wow, people are actually really good still. And so my story is a very extreme circumstance, but this goes for any experience that you're having, that you're struggling with, because most of the time, you're gonna look back at it, you're gonna say, wow, there are a lot of beautiful lessons that I learned there, I wouldn't trade it for the world, I'm glad that it happened, or you actually, I can't believe at the time I even cared about that situation, because you've moved past it, which you always do, it's just not a big deal anymore, but it builds your character and it makes you stronger. Now after going through the house fire, of course I don't wanna go through one again, but if I were to go through one again, I wouldn't be nearly as bad off as somebody who's having their house burned down for the first time. So you build strength through the tough times, guys. That's the number six, you need to be more urgent. Time is not going any slower. We are only getting older. We're only getting closer to death every single day. As Gary Vee says, you're gonna die one day. You're gonna die. It's inevitable for all of us. And I see this so much with a lot of my friends, with my brother's friends, even with myself at times, where I don't have that sense of urgency and I just get into the analysis paralysis. I'm like, oh, maybe I would like that, maybe that is what I want. But then you don't end up trying it or you eventually end up trying it and you regret it because you wish you would have started when you had actually thought about it. So as soon as you think, you might even be slightly interested in something. You need to go out and try it. You need to be curious. So many people say, I don't know what I wanna do. And they've tried one or two things within their lives and they're like, I'm stuck. Dude, you haven't tried anything. How are you supposed to know what you wanna do? So as soon as you have that thought, you need to go out and try it. Obviously, the person that goes out and tries things the quickest is the one who's gonna get the results the quickest. The seventh lesson is allow yourself to have humility. I used to have an enormous ego and the ego is still there. I don't know if it's possible to fully remove it, but we can always lessen our ego. And one of the most beautiful things about being a human being is to have humility because we're all imperfect. the only person that's perfect is God. And our ego gets in the way of so many beautiful lessons because we always think we know what is best for ourselves. So there's three things that happen when you start to lessen or remove your ego. The first thing that happens is you start to learn more because you actually listen and you're more open-minded to learning. Second thing, you will connect with people easier. I'm not super smart by any means, guys. I'm not intelligent. My IQ is probably extremely average. My maths are terrible. My spelling is atrocious. It takes humility to say that, but by saying something like that, a few of you have probably just connected with me because you feel the same way about yourself. And the third thing that happens is you become more authentic because you're less concerned keeping this facade of. You can truly be yourself because there's no ego there. You're not trying to impress anybody anymore. You are who you are. And that allows you to focus on having more genuine conversations and genuine relationships with people. and it allows you to be more critical with your self-improvement because you're being honest with yourself. And I won't take credit for this because I saw this in a YouTube comment section one time and it said, one of the single greatest sources of wisdom is realizing how little you actually know about everything. And that is so true. And the eighth lesson is, anything is actually possible. I'm at the point now, dude, where you could literally tell me anything and I would believe that it's possible for you. 99% of people could listen to what you'd say and they'd say, that is impossible. that is never gonna happen in a million years. And I would say if you put in enough focus, you actually believe that you can do it yourself and you get the right people to help you, that it is possible. There has always been somebody that has done something that people said was impossible. Plains, wifi, electricity, we have all of these examples in front of us, yet we still doubt ourselves. And the reason I have this belief that anything is possible is because I've started to do it for myself. At one point in time, I didn't think that being a YouTuber was like very realistic for myself until I started actually putting in 100% effort. And it comes with the achievements of doing the things that you didn't think were possible. And then your brain starts to realize there's so much opportunity. And it's like you start to gain so much self-belief and you realize that there's literally nothing I can't do. I can do anything as long as I put in 100% effort. And I truly believe that I can do it. You will achieve it. It's only a matter of time. So if you guys feel right now that there's nobody that believes in you, I believe in you. I know that you can do it. I know that you can literally do anything that you put your mind to. As long as you're honest with yourself and you're putting in 100% effort, it's only a matter of time for it to happen for you. So I hope this video helped you guys. I really do help that some of these lessons are going to improve your life. And if you guys enjoyed it, I'd really appreciate a like and a comment and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " So I haven't done one of these in a very long time and quite a lot of my life has changed recently. So I figured one of the best videos we could do now is a Q and A, just update you guys with what's going on in my life, the new things that I'm doing. So getting the basic things out of the way first. My name is Brandon Balfour. I'm 24 years old. I live in Vancouver, Canada. I am a five foot eight, I weigh 150 pounds. I bench press 600 pounds. My dick is 12 inches long and I am a straight male. Very straight male. I don't know why I always get asked if I'm gay. I don't know if it's because I look that good. I'm just joking. I always get asked if I'm gay. I have no idea why, but I promise you guys, I very much like women. And I also forgot to mention I was born in England. I'm part Chinese, Danish, and Portuguese. So that gets the basic stuff out the way. And I'll get to the questions. So the first question, do you see yourself staying in Vancouver or moving stateside, et cetera? So if you guys follow me on Instagram, you would know how much I've been complaining about Vancouver weather recently. It has been absolutely atrocious. It is like the worst weather we've ever had at this time of year. It is June and there's a literal storm outside right now. And it's been like this for the past, I don't even know how long, three weeks. It's just ridiculous. So I definitely see myself moving. I don't know where exactly I want to go. I need to go somewhere with Sun though. The only reason I've been staying here for the past 23 years was just because this is where my parents settled down. Now I'm at a point in my life where I can move wherever I'd like and I can work from there. So I'm going to start experimenting, go checking out different places. The next place I'm going to right now is Florida, I'm gonna go check out Miami. I'm not a huge party person, so I don't know if I'm gonna like that city. I'm mainly going there just because of the weather as well as taxes, but I'll need to figure out whether I even like it first, and then getting visas and things like that will be a challenge, but yeah, I definitely plan on moving out of Vancouver. I don't wanna stay here much longer, especially with taxes here and how expensive things are, it's just getting ridiculous. If you weren't a content creator, what job would you want to have? If I wasn't a content creator, I'd 100% be doing some sort of sales job. And the reason I would choose a sales job is just because you're unlimited to how much money you can earn. Your growth is not stuck. Unlike working in most corporate jobs, you've got to have seniority to earn more money. You've got to be there for a very long time. You're also usually capped out at a salary that you can earn within the company. And I just love the fact that within sales, commission-based, it's based on your own performance. You could be the newest guy in the sales office and make more money than the top sales guy just based on your own skills. So I love the fact that self development is the factor in terms of how much money you can earn. The more you put into yourself, the more you learn, the more money you can earn. And I just love that. And you also don't have to go to school, which is another benefit of doing sales. What's your favorite going out drink? I rarely ever drink. I probably drink once or twice a year. I don't think it is beneficial in any way, shape, or form, but there's certain times where I don't have anything to do. I'm on vacation, so I'm like, okay, I'll have one drink. And usually that's a Moscow mule. I love Moscow mules. I'll actually just go and ask for a virgin Moscow Mule without the alcohol just because I love ginger beer and the lime, but for some reason they just won't sell it to me. I've literally asked for a virgin Moscow Mule. They're like, sorry, we can't do that. I said, why? I'm gonna pay for it. You can't just not put the alcohol on it? They're like, no. So I usually get a Moscow Mule that's my favorite going out drink if I'm going to drink. What is your education slash degree? So my education level is grade 12, max. I didn't go to university, I didn't go to college. There's nothing that I needed to go to university four to become. Obviously I'm doing my dream job right now which is the content creator and there's nothing you can go to university and be given after four or five years where you're like okay you're a certified content creator now, but I can't start filming it. No you can't, it's just getting out there, posting, learning from experience, watching youtube videos on how to use your camera, how to speak better, how to communicate. So obviously there was nothing that I needed to go go to university four, which is why I just quit after grade 12 in terms of education in the schooling system. And I self taught myself a lot of things and I read lots of books and I learned that way instead. How big the titties now? I think I'm still at a small C cup. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, trying to get to the double D's boys. It's gonna take a while, but I think right now, if I'm being honest, probably the smallest C cup. BMW mods list. You guys know I'll sit here and talk about my car all day long So I have quite a few different mods and I'm probably gonna forget a bunch because there's a lot to go through But I'll think of the main ones. So I have a stage 2 MHD 93 tune I didn't want to go with ethanol I don't want to have to find an e-gas station all the time and do the conversions for the gasoline mixtures and stuff So stage 2 93 is what my car is on. I have active auto works catted down pipe I have a full AWE exhaust system, front splitter, rear diffuser, lowered on dyno springs, MST cold air intake, Vossen wheels, custom Alcantara steering wheel, carbon fiber parts on the inside, yellow DRLs. I think I've gotten most of them, probably a few other things that I'm missing, but the main ones were those. What's your workout split? So my workout split for a very long time was push-pull legs. I was doing that for the last three years and I would say over the past year I have just mainly done push pull and the reason I've done mainly just push pull and I've skipped legs is because my legs aren't twigs to begin with and It was so difficult to fit into pants already at five foot eight It's virtually impossible to find pants that fit properly now add big quads to that equation and you're not finding anything I trained legs once every two weeks just to maintain and I can still fit into my pants There was a point where none of my suit supply pants were fitting properly anymore. They're pulling super hard on my quads I'm like I'm not wasting $300 on another pair of pants when I have a perfect pair here So I stopped training it just enough to that shrunk down ever so slightly and I could fit back into them And now I just maintain my legs at that size and it looks fine. My legs aren't tiny. So we're good in that department How much do you bench? I told you at the beginning I benched 600 pounds Now realistically guys, I haven't trained bench press in a very long time I found that that movement it just it's not good for your shoulders So I haven't trained bench in maybe three years. I train incline bench though The reason my titties look like titties is because I train all incline movements I've never done a PR on incline bench, but I can rep about 215 for 6 to 7 reps and as usually the minimum amount of reps that I'll do for any of my movements is 6 to 7 any more than that It's like strength training. I focus a lot on hypertrophy and higher rep ranges Well, this is a really good question. How important to your personal growth was moving out? It was extremely important and for those of you that don't know I moved out in February I'd been previously living with my parents even though I could have probably afforded to move out a year prior I didn't because I was too afraid to do so, but that was the reason I moved out. I was too comfortable at home I knew that in order to take it to the next level. I needed that level of uncomfortability I needed that recurring income coming out of my bank account to push me to the next level because eventually You become comfortable at this level and then you got to push yourself ever so slightly again I'm already starting to get comfortable with the rent here And I know eventually in order to get to the next level after that I'm gonna have to do the same thing again and that doesn't necessarily need to always involve adding more expenses to your life Because that can be extremely dangerous as well But always looking for some sort of route to cause you uncomfortability to push you to the next level because I think for most of us We can push ourselves to a certain extent, but if you don't have any uncomfortability. It's very difficult to keep going up. You almost always have to constantly add more uncomfortability to get to the next level. That was the reason I did it. I was too comfortable at home. Second reason was I needed more lighting. I needed a bigger space. I wanted to make better videos. If you guys haven't seen the apartment tour, my apartment is 99% windows. I have a 180 degree view of Vernabee in Vancouver, which is where I live. I can see virtually everything. I don't use any external lighting. All the lighting you see in here is just from natural lighting. So that was one of the other reasons why and the final reason was I just didn't think that I could become the man That I wanted to be while being dependent on my parents and for those of you that live at home Probably feel like that as well You can't fully become a man if you're depending on your parents You need to become an independent individual to become the man and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to move out because it is Extremely expensive and most people aren't earning enough money to move out at least being able to take care of your own bills at least pay for your food, pay for your space, that's gonna give you almost the same sense of feel as being independent and living on your own. And there's some people that don't wanna move out at all and they wanna live with their parents, which is fine. But like I said, if you can pay for your expenses, that's gonna give you the same type of feeling of being independent. But if you can afford to move out, 100% do it, it is extremely important for your own development. And I wish it's an experience that all of you guys will get to have in your lives. Ferrari or Lamborghini. I don't know if I can give a statement because I've never driven either of them yet. Keyword yet, I will drive one fairly soon. But I've always been a Ferrari fanboy. I think Ferrari just has a better range of vehicles. They have the 458, the 488, the 488 Pista, the A12 Superfast, the F12, the F8 Tributo, the 296, the LaFerrari, and then Lambo's got the Huracan, Huracan STO, Lamborghini SVJ, which obviously is a lot of people's dream car. I love the SVJ that would be the one Lamborghini I would get. I just think Ferrari has better vehicles, appearance wise, as well as the range of vehicles that they have, they just have more. So I'd say I'm a Ferrari fanboy right now, but like I said, I don't know if I can give an actual opinion because I haven't driven either of them. It might change in the future, who knows. One advice for upcoming adults. The best advice I would give you because I see a lot of people deal with this, even myself, earlier on was, what do I wanna do? And you get into this analysis paralysis period where you're just like, I just don't know what I wanna do. So then you don't do anything. So the best advice that I would give you is just go and try everything as fast as you possibly can. Time is not waiting around for us to make decisions, guys. If you're not making a decision, time is just gonna keep going by and you're gonna get older. We're getting closer to death every single day. So as soon as you have some sort of interest in something, go try it out as fast as you can. If you don't like it, it doesn't matter. Move on to the next thing. Just keep trying it as fast as you can. Cause the person that does that obviously is gonna get the results that they want sooner in the person that just thinks about it and sits there and is like, oh, I just don't know what I want to do. Well, you haven't tried much. So how would you know what you want to do? So the best advice I'd give you, go try as many things as you can and do it as quickly as you possibly can. Do you like riding your motorcycle? Dude, it is so funny. So for those of you that don't know, I just recently bought a motorcycle. I don't even know if you can consider it a motorcycle because it is the slowest motorcycle you can buy. It is a 125 CC engine. It's called a Hanna-Grom. Tiny bike, it's basically a moped. And that was the reason I had bought it and my friends bought it as well. I just know personally, I shouldn't hop on a 600 or 1000 because I'm gonna kill myself. I know I'm too stupid. My car is fast enough for that, so I don't need to go and upgrade to a big bike like that. As long as all of us stick on the groms, I'm not gonna feel the need to go and get a bigger bike anyways because we're all gonna be going the same speed. But the grom, because it is so small and so easy to maneuver, it feels very nostalgic for me. It reminds me of back in the day when you'd have your bicycle and you go to your friends, I was usually to drop them out front, Pick them up and then you just go roam the earth and your parents have no idea where you've gone. That's what it reminds me of. It's a very freeing experience. You don't really have to follow the rules of the road either. You can just like hop onto the sidewalks and hop wheelies super easily, although you should be safe and you shouldn't do those things. I do. Just because that was the whole reason we bought them was to stunt them. I've only been riding for about seven days. I can already pop a decent wheelie. It's just a blast. If you have the opportunity to buy a grom, you definitely got to try it out, dude. It is so freaking fun. If you're not responsible, don't upgrade to a 600 or 1000 CC. I'm not responsible, so I won't do it. What's your main source of income? Now, I think this is quite obvious, but I'll answer it anyways. My main source of income comes from my social media platforms. I had mentioned in one of my previous YouTube videos that I did real estate and I do have some money in real estate, but it doesn't actually add much to my income. It's maybe 5% of the money that I earn comes from real estate. Most of my money comes from social media. You guys have been watching my YouTube videos recently. I've been including a sponsorship in each one of my videos. The reason I've been doing that guys is because people think you make a lot of money from YouTube, you make no money from YouTube. At least in my niche, I make $400 per video on average. It's not even enough to pay my brother and I post only two times a month. If that was the case and I live here in Canada so you wouldn't even be able to buy a month worth of groceries for $800. So you have to take on sponsorships as a creator and I will say I do really appreciate you guys and I'm making a big deal out of it when I do post sponsorships, because in order for me to earn any money to make more videos, I have to take on a sponsorship. But I will never, ever promote something that I think is negative, something that I don't personally use or would think is beneficial to you. I've been offered large amounts of money for gambling, liquor, sex stuff. I've said no to all of them. There's people that would take that and promote that, and I would never do something like that to you guys. Unless it is gonna be beneficial to you guys, or I personally use it myself, I will never promote anything. So apart from that rant, I make my money from all of my platforms now. Only YouTube recently, I started making money from those sponsorships. Previously, all of my money was coming from TikTok sponsorships and Instagram partnerships. Sorry guys, I had to switch up the audio here. My mic just died. The next question was cars you wanna buy and anything you're planning to buy. Cars I'm planning to buy within this year, I think I'm gonna get the M3 competition. And this is annoying thing that happens once you become a car guy. You just crave more power. It's not like my M340i isn't fast enough. It's got 500 horsepower, but I'm like, no, I need 800 horsepower. It's like this never ending thing. Like what am I gonna go to a Bugatti next? It's like, oh, it's so annoying. I think the next car, M3 competition, I'm gonna do probably the same mods that I have to my M340i, just a 93 tune, which would probably get me to about 700 wheel horsepower, which is ridiculously quick. But like I said, it seems like power is never enough for a car guys. We'll have to see. I think in the future, maybe two, three, four years down the line, there's quite a few cars that I wanna get. There's gonna be new cars by the time I can afford to go and buy those. As of right now, if we're basing it on the cars that are on the market, Lamborghini SVG I'd love to have at one point, the A12 Superfast, F8 Tributo, McLaren 765 LT, Porsche 911 Turbo S, there's so many different cars I would like to try and drive in the future. Those are the ones that I'd like right now. If you had to choose between old money and street wear forever, what would you choose? Is that even a question? Of course I would choose old money. It's just the classy way of dressing. Why would I why would I choose street wear? I don't think there's many people that would choose to dress street wear for the rest of their lives. Imagine being 60 years old and dressing in street wear that would be ridiculous. How to know that you are in the right direction? Everybody's direction is gonna be different. Everybody has different goals in life, but I would say that you know that you're going in the right direction if you actually enjoy what you're doing at the time. And this is the thing you guys need to realize too is there's gonna be points in time just like with mother nature that the seasons change and there's different seasons in your life. You're going to enjoy doing something for a certain period of time and then maybe a few months or a few years down the line it doesn't give you the same fulfillment or enjoyment that it once did then you just need to pivot and try something else. It's this interesting thing because this roadmap of life is not just one direction you just go like this. It's not linear it's this weird roadmap that will go side to side sometimes you'll go diagonal then you come back down and then you go straight up and then you're over here and then you're over here. That's the beautiful thing is just when it doesn't feel right anymore you just know it's time to pivot. A lot of people end up finding themselves stuck where they're like I don't like this moment why do I not like this and they battle with themselves and they feel bad about it rather than just changing the direction because you've changed as a person you're at a different time in your life and it's time to try something new. To answer your question like I said at the beginning you know the direction that you're going in is the right way if it feels good to you. What's a small thing that makes you happy? Honestly just Watching a movie with my brother or having the boys come over. I have a big projector screen here So just watching a movie is always a good time and I definitely don't take those little moments for granted It's always very pleasurable experience Just hanging out with friends and your family and enjoying a good movie So we watch lots of South Korean movies now actually because Hollywood just comes out with just dog shit movies these days There's no storyline to it. Those of you that have watched South Korean movies We'll just know they're just ten times better than Hollywood ones Hollywood ones used to be good a long time ago, but now they just have these massive budgets and they put it all into CGI with no storyline, hire all the craziest actors, and it's just not very good. We watch a lot of South Korean movies and I enjoy watching them a lot with friends and family. Do you wish to start a brand in the future? Most definitely, actually very soon. I'm gonna start working on something now, boys. So be prepared within a year's time, hopefully I'll have it ready to launch. I'm not gonna say what it is, but I do have something to cook enough. So hopefully we'll have something come to fruition. So I'm gonna cut the Q and A off there. I feel like we've answered quite a lot of questions. I hope you guys have gotten more insight into my life as well as maybe you'll learn something from maybe one of the things that I said and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " So I live all the way over here or 90% of the year it looks like this But very recently the ice caps have started to melt Which means it is finally hot enough to drop the summer 2024 wardrobe video I'm definitely the first person within the niche to drop that hold up one second Okay, we're good. I just wanted to make sure you Harry So today I'll be sharing with you guys the ultimate summer 2024 wardrobe as well as I'm going to include a multitude of alternatives to the things that I wear in today's video in the description below so there's something for everyone to get. So starting with shorts. I bet you guys have all been waiting for the day that you hear me say that. So there are four types of styles of shorts that I recommend for you guys that I think look best. The first pair of shorts is the drawstring linen short and these typically come in a more relaxed fit or loose fit. He's worked really well if you like to wear more relaxed fit upper garments you relax fit camp colors your classic fit Or you relax fit linen shirts look really nice with these as well The second pair of shorts is for my old money. I did it good aka me We have the tailored side adjuster shorts You can get these in cotton or you can get these in linen or if you can't afford another pair of these tailor side Adjuster pants then you can just take your suit to play pants that you bought from winter time cut those bitches in half Did you imagine dude spending that much money just to cut them in half for summertime? You just gotta recycle them all the time. So these shorts look best with your slim fitted garments. So your slim fitted t-shirts, your slim fitted polos, your slim fit linen shirts. I would typically wear these to an evening event if you're going out for a nice dinner. These are definitely the shorts to wear. So the third pair of shorts is the board short. Now for those of you that don't know what the board short is, it is essentially a pair of shorts that can be worn casually or can be worn in the ocean or the pool as swim shorts. They're typically gonna come with a button and a zipper. And like I said, it's more of a casual option. So I wouldn't be rolling up to dinner in these. This is more for a day out where you're going for brunch or you're gonna end up in the pool or in the ocean at some point throughout the day. And the final pair of shorts is swim trunks. Now for swim trunks, I suggest that you go with a vibrant color. It's kind of like an unspoken rule that you don't show up to the beach wearing a pair of black swim trunks. It's just lame. You go with the vibrant blues, vibrant green, orange, pink, purple. You can virtually go with any color, but the neutrals and it's gonna look good. Trust me, get a vibrant color. Now moving on to my favorite section, pants. I don't know why I hate shorts so much. I think it just looks weird on me. I'm not 100% sure why it looks weird on me either. I just really don't like shorts. So if we're talking pants, we're obviously talking linen. We're not gonna be wearing wool trousers for sure. You're gonna want two different pairs of linen pants, your midday pants and your evening pants. Now, midday pants, you're gonna wanna go for something that is very relaxed, something loose fit like these Abercrombie ones. You can have a drawstring, you can have belt loops. It doesn't really matter too much. The main thing is just make sure it's relaxed fit because in the peak hours of the day, you're not gonna want something that's too restrictive that's gonna get you very hot. Now, for your evening time, you're gonna wanna go for something a little bit different, something that is nice and slim, tailored. Maybe you like pleat, so you go with something pleated. You can go with belt loops, or you can go with side adjusters, but you wanna make sure you have some sort of dapper trouser for the evening time when you go out for a nice dinner. Now, we're gonna move into our tops. And if you're somebody who just likes a very simplistic look, you don't wanna have collars, you don't wanna have buttons, I suggest you guys get some nice slim fitted t-shirts, a few different colors, some in black, gray, brown, beige, navy, oatmeal. Now if you do plan on going this route and just wearing t-shirts all the time, make sure that you remember the importance of accessories. We're also gonna get into the importance of that later on in the video. Now the next shirt we have is the classic linen shirt. Now just like our pants and shorts, you're going to wanna choose a fit according to the way that you typically dress. So if you like to wear looser fit, lower garments, you're gonna wanna go with the classic fit linen shirt. It's a bit looser fit, much more conservative cut. Now if you like to dress with more tailored lower garments, then you're gonna wanna go with a slim fit linen shirt, especially if you wanna tuck it in because you don't wanna have that massive excess roll of fabric around your waist. And when it comes to colors, don't be afraid to go loud with this one either. I like to wear blue, I like to wear green linen shirts, but of course get yourself a white linen shirt first because that's a staple in every man's wardrobe. Moving on to our next shirt, which is the camp color shirt. And I personally love the loose fit, more relaxed fit camp colored shirts. Pair these with a nice little white flover underneath, which you're seeing me wear right now. And again guys, it is summertime, so don't be shy of the patterns, the bright colors. You can get these in so many different fabrics. You can get in linen, cotton, polyester, and crochet if you like texture. Here are these with your loose fit linen shorts, your board shorts, or your loose fit pants. It's a vibe. Next top we have is the Polo or the Polo Cartagena. Now these are gonna be your more formal attire tops. And whether you choose the Johnny collar, which is the one without any buttons, or just the one with the buttons, doesn't really matter. Both of them look quite elegant. And in terms of styling these, you're gonna wanna style these with your tailored linen shorts or your tailored linen pants. Now, we move into our footwear section and I highly recommend that you buy yourself a pair of dressy sandals. Now, dressy sandals is typically going to have leather straps or suede straps and this is just gonna give you the most versatility for all of your different summer outfits. You can wear these at any point in time and you're not gonna have to worry about looking like a slob. Next, we have the sneaker. Now, it doesn't need to be white, although white sneakers are always gonna give you the most versatility. I have personally kind of gotten bored of white leather sneakers recently. So I have switched to a light beige suede sneaker. It's not gonna be as versatile as a white leather sneaker, but it is still going to give you a lot of versatility. Light beige can go with a lot of different colors. So if you're like myself, you wanna wear something that's different, this is a great alternative to the white leather sneaker. And the final footwear item is the suede loafer. I've repeated myself a million times about these already. So I'm not gonna explain myself, just trust me and buy them already. Now we move into our accessories. And this is super important because obviously in the summertime, you're wearing less layers, so your outfits become more simplistic. Now we're going to counter that with our accessories. At a bare minimum, you're gonna want some sort of wrist accessory, whether that is a cuff bracelet, a chain link bracelet, a leather bracelet or a watch. And then I'd say also wear some sort of pendant necklace and a pair of sunglasses as your bare minimum when going with any outfit. And a key tip from a guys that have watches, I'm gonna give you guys a sauce cause some people don't know you can do this, but switch out your watch strap for something that is more summery. You don't even need to buy a brand new watch. You can switch out your straps that you have on your watch for something that is more summery. I previously had a black leather alligator strap on this Longis watch. It looked like a fall winter watch. You definitely couldn't wear it in the summertime. It just didn't go with the outfits and the colors. And then I switched it out for this suede beige strap. And now it looks like a summer watch. It looks completely different. And I didn't even have to buy a brand new watch. I spent $100 on this watch strap. And now it's something that I can wear all summer long with all of my summer outfits. And then when the wintertime rolls around again, I'll just switch it out for the black one. It's perfect. You save money and then you also have an accessory that's going to suit your outfits as well as the weather outside So that is everything that you need to look like an absolute stud this summer if you guys want specific accessories to buy I just did this video recently just over here and apart from that. I'll catch you guys in the next video"

        "transcript": " They're probably just as confused as every other dude is in skincare. You're seeing these influencers, these celebrities, attributing their glass skin to this elaborate 20-step skincare routine, and they swear by it. They swear that if they didn't have this amazing skincare routine, they would look like Deadpool's left nut. A warrior has nothing to be ashamed of. When in reality, 80% of the results, or even more, is going to come from just three skincare products. And just like Pareto's principle, 20% of efforts is going to get you 80% of the results. And this is the same scenario. So what are those three products? Well, before we even get into the three products, there's three things that you guys need to be doing. This is the most important before you even get into skincare, because without doing these things properly, it's gonna be virtually impossible to have nice skin. The first step is to get your diet in check. I do not give a shit if dermatologists say that food doesn't impact your skin. It certainly does, and I know this for myself, my brother, my friends, a bunch of followers I've talked to, as soon as you cut out your processed foods, your sugars, your seed oils, your skin is gonna look better than it ever has before. And not to mention another byproduct of just doing this, you're just gonna get shredded in the process as well. So it's an added bonus of doing that and getting your gut health and that bacteria healthier again. Two is your sleep. Lack of sleep is going to promote and increase the stress hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is going to increase inflammation as well as sebum and oil production which is going to result in clogged pores increasing your acne. So you wanna make sure you're getting about 78 hours of sleep every single night. Go to bed at a consistent time and you also just want to make sure you're reducing stress as much as you possibly can in your life. Go to the gym, go to the sauna, meditate, yoga, do all the things that help you de-stress, and overall, doing all of these things is going to really improve the health of your skin. Step number three, make sure you are doing your basic hygiene, things like your bed sheets and your towels, you wanna be washing those with hot water weekly, because obviously, if you're using these things frequently, or you're sleeping in your bed for eight hours, there's gonna be so much oil buildup as well as dead skin cells, so that's going to cause acne, you're constantly putting your face on there, so make sure that you got those things under control. Anything that is touching your face, you're gonna wanna make sure that it's clean. Like your phone, for example, apparently it's got more bacteria than a toilet seat and that's going to go on the side of your face when your on phone calls. So make sure that you're wiping that down with the Lysol Wipe every once in a while as well. Alright, so now that you got those things sorted, let's move into the actual skincare. So I'm going to discuss two different types of skincare. The typical science-based dermatologist recommended skincare, which is the one I've been using since I started skincare. And then we have the fully natural skincare routine for the people that don't want to put any unnatural products on their face. First step in any skincare routine is the cleanse. You're gonna do this once in the morning and once at night and for those of you that don't know how to cleanse It's as simple as getting your face wet with lukewarm water taking about a quarter-sized amount of your product pumping it into your hand And then massaging it into your face for about 30 to 60 seconds But you're not just gonna choose any cleanser guys everybody has different skin So you need to get products that are meant for your skin type So typically each individual is going to fall into one of these three categories You're either going to have dry skin you're going to have oily skin or you're going to have a combination skin type which is a combination of both. You're gonna have an oily T-zone and you're gonna have dry cheeks. Order to find out what skin type you have. You're going to wash your face with water and that's it and you're just gonna leave it for the next hour or so. And then you're gonna go into a well-lit area like your washroom, you're gonna take a look at your face. Now, is your face shiny? If your face is shiny, then it is oily. Now, if your face looks really dry and flaky, you obviously have dry skin and then if you have combination skin, you'll know because your cheeks are gonna be really dry but your nose and your forehead and your chin are gonna be shine. Starting off with my oily skin people. Generally, you're gonna wanna use a foaming cleanser. Now you can get away with a non foaming cleanser. I just found that a foaming cleanser worked for me. The best one I was trying to remove the oil. Key ingredients you're gonna wanna look for in your cleanser are salicylic acid and niacinamide. Now it's important to note that when you're using an ingredient like salicylic acid that you work your way up in strength. You don't wanna start off with the highest percentage of salicylic acid if you've never used it before cause it can be a powerful ingredient depending on how sensitive your skin is. It might not react well. So start off with something lower and then you can work your way up as you go. By I will be leaving all the best products for each skin type in the description below as well. For my people with the dry skin, you're gonna want a non-foaming cleanser. And the key ingredients you're gonna want to look for in your cleanser are hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin, and aloe vera. It doesn't have to include all of these, just look for a few of these ingredients. And for my people with normal to combination skin, you guys can get away with just a gentle cleanser. Now for those that want the fully natural solution, just wool to wool do mate. Just wash it as if you had a cleanser on your hands and that's it. Nice and simple. So when creating your ideal skincare routine is essential to listen to your skin's needs and adapt accordingly. Similarly, when life challenges arise, which they eventually do, it's crucial to tune into your emotional needs and seek the support that resonates with you. In the past, I've had many friends come to me and ask for help and I've tried my best to help them, but ultimately I am not a professional, I am not a therapist. So it's always best to go the professional route. Speaking to a therapist can be a safe space to express your thoughts and feelings without the fear of judgment. It's an opportunity to gain a fresh perspective, learn new coping mechanisms, and work through the obstacles that are holding you back. But however, I understand that the first step can be daunting, you don't necessarily know which way to turn, and that is where BetterHelp comes in. As the sponsor of today's video, BetterHelp is an online therapy platform that makes it easier to connect with licensed therapists from the comfort of your own home. Now whether you prefer phone calls, video chat, or messaging, BetterHelp has a variety of different ways that you can communicate with a therapist, ensuring that you can find a method that works best for you. They have over 30,000 therapists within their network, so BetterHelp can help you match with a professional that understands your unique needs and provide you the support that you need. And if you don't like this therapist, you feel that you don't get along with them, you can easily switch to one of the other therapists within their network and no additional cost. So remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not of weakness. So if you guys feel that you need to speak with somebody, you can go take the first step, go to betterhelp.com slash brandonbalfour, or you can use brandonbalfour at signup for a special discount off your first month of therapy. Your mental health matters and you deserve support when navigating through life's challenges. Let's get back to the video. Now, moving on to the second step in the skincare routine, which is to moisturize. Again, you're gonna do this once in the morning and once at night time. For those that don't know how to apply moisturizer, apply a nickel sized amount into your hand. What I like to do is I just take it on my finger, apply some to my forehead and my cheeks, and then I massage it into my face from there. For people with oily skin, you're going to want to look for moisturizers that have some of the ingredients like cellulose, like acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, or a retinol. Now, if you're going to use a moisturizer with retinol, I suggest that you save that for the evening time. Apparently it can have a bad reaction with the sun. So if you get one, save that one for the evening time and have a separate one for the morning. For my people with dry skin, you're gonna wanna look for moisturizers that contain ceramides, hyaluronic acid, glycerin, niacinamide, shea butter, and aloe vera. Again, it doesn't need to have all these ingredients. I'm just giving you a list that you can look for when you're buying a moisturizer. And now for combination skin, you're gonna wanna look for ingredients like galactic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, vitamin B5, and ceramides. For my fully natural peeps, you can actually use aloe vera or you can use beef tallow. Now apparently beef tallow works really well as a moisturizer because it's saturated fats, closely resembles the natural oils that your face produces. It contains vitamin A, D, E, and K. And it's also non-comidomic, which means it's not going to clog your pores. That's actually what I have on my face right now. I've been using it for the past two days because I've seen a lot of people recommend it. I don't know if it works so far. I mean, my face is definitely moisturized, but I don't know if it's going to cause me to break out. So I'll keep you guys updated with that. But so far, seems to be doing a very good job. And the final step in the skincare routine is the sunscreen. Now it's important that you guys buy a mineral sunscreen and not one of these other sunscreens that contain any of these ingredients that I'm listing up on the screen right now. You can take a screenshot of this and use this for your reference because some of these can be extremely harmful to your body. Now, when applying sunscreen, obviously you only need to do it in the morning unless you live in like fucking Norway where the sun never goes down. And you're gonna wanna apply a generous amount sunscreen to your face, I'd say about a quarter size amount should probably be enough. You will have a bit of a white cast. You might look a little bit like Edward from Twilight, or you can get a tinted sunscreen. That's the one that I use if you have a bit darker skin, but if you have pale skin, you're gonna look even paler, but it is going to protect your skin so that you prevent sagging skin and dark spots as long as you can. For our honorable mentions, like I said, these other products are not necessary, but if you would like to use them, they might slightly increase the appearance of your skin, and that is exfoliants and hydrating serums. Now, what a chemical exfoliant is gonna do is basically going to exfoliate your skin without you having to use your hands to exfoliate or using a scrub. Exfoliant ingredients are like salicylic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, or even retinol. And with an exfoliant, like I said before, these can be quite strong, so you wanna do a test patch on your skin before you go about going all over your face. Try it out on your skin, see how it reacts first because they can be quite strong to begin with. And when it comes to application, just read the bottle because I think every exfoliant is probably going to be different in terms of how frequently you should be using them as well as how to actually apply them. And when it comes to actually using your exfoliant, you're going to use this right after you wash your face. Next, we have a hydrating serum and a hydrating serum is exactly what it sounds like it's going to do. It's just going to give you some extra hydration. Typically, a hydrating serum is going to have the ingredients, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide. To apply a serum, you're going to apply two to three drops on your face and then you're going to pat into your face rather than rub and you're You're also gonna bring it down to your neck. That's also a key tip for all of your products. Bring it down to your neck as well. And in terms of when you're gonna apply this, this is gonna be right before you apply your moisturizer. So that is everything that you actually need to do and to use to have a good skincare routine. I am not a dermatologist by any means. Do your own research before using any of these products, but this is what I found has worked for me. You guys found this video insightful. Please drop a comment and a like, and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " A woman has makeup, lip fillers, and a BBL. Men have their clothes, their accessories, and their hair. Some guys have their hair. All right, you're challenging me to a fight. A man without accessories is like an eagle without wings. You might look kind of dope, but you ain't fly. Pun intended. So today I put together seven accessories every guy must have as well as alternatives for everyone's budget. Everything will be linked in the description below that we talk about today, guys. A first accessory every guy should have is a watch. Now, just because you see all these guys on social media rocking Rolexes, protect-filled leaves, or Richard Mills, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy a watch just because you can't afford one of those brands. And besides, what's the deal with the Richard Mill anyways? Shit looks like you might pick it up in your next McDonald's Happy Meal. I'd rather wear a fucking Ben 10 watch, no cap. The point is, the watch is there to compliment your outfit. It doesn't matter how expensive it is or what brand it is, it is there to look stylish. So I personally have two watches, the Tiso PRX Powermatic 80, which I think is probably the best watch for under $1,000 based on design as well as materials used. I also have a Longines Dolce Vita And between these two watches, they suit all of my different occasions. Now, some great alternatives to these watches, which I assume most of you guys are gonna be looking for something under $1,000. We have the Orient Bambino, the Timex Marlin Jet, the Seiko Cocktail Time, the Waterloo, Seiko SPB155, the Tiso Purex, Powermatic 80, and the Mido Multi-Fort Patrimoni. Those are all fantastic watches, they're extremely versatile. The next accessory is a leather duffel bag or a leather backpack. Now, if you're a student, maybe you'll want to prioritize the leather backpack, mainly college, if you're in high school, don't bother buying this stuff yet. You don't have enough money or ask for it for Christmas. And if you're not in school and you're like myself, then buy yourself a nice leather duffel bag. The most compliments I have received in my entire life from both men and women have been my double Ds. I'm not kidding all the time. But what I was actually gonna say is my coach, Gotham Duffelbag, in this beautiful brown colorway. It is a close second in compliments to my chest. So whether you're going traveling, you're going on a weekend trip, or you're going to school, you want to get yourself a nice leather backpack or duffel bag. I will warn you, a real leather item is not cheap guys. This is not canvas, this is not nylon, this is real leather, so be prepared. Some options for leather duffels are the Kessler Large Duffle from Leatherology, the Ted Baker Sapiano Leather Duffle, the Graham Leather Overnighter, the Polo Ralph Lauren and Black Smooth Leather Duffle Bag, the Carl Friedrich Khaleesi Weekender, Coach Gotham Duffle, which is the one I have, or the Coach Trekker 582. And on the high end, but insanely great quality, is the Frank Clegg Signature Travel Duffel. Now for your backpacks, you have the Coach Outlet Sprint backpack, the Coach Hitch backpack, the Slowen backpack from Lotherology, and the Buckner leather backpack from Fossil. Moving on, you will need a pendant necklace. Now a pendant necklace adds visual interest and draws your attention down to your neckline. In my case, it draws your attention down to my triple Ds. Assuming you guys have a similar style to mine, you'll want something that is minimal. There are quite a few options when it comes to pendant necklaces in shapes and designs. You go for a circle, a bar, a rectangle, or even like mine, a combination of three different things. The one that you guys see me currently wearing is the Aegis Trilogy, a gate necklace from MainSci. Key tip, if you guys want your necklace to be short like mine, so when you wear a polo or you're wearing a tank top, it's going to sit above and you'll always see it. Go shop in the women's section. Most of the time they have the exact same necklaces, but with a shorter length. Next accessory I think you guys should get is a cuff bracelet. Now the reason I love the cuff bracelet is because there are days that I don't feel like wearing my watch, but I don't want my wrist to be completely bare. The cuff bracelet is that perfect accessory that just adds a bit of flavor to your outfit. And the one that I am wearing is the Taylor cuff from MainSide. It's kind of got this belt-like closure that is really elegant and aesthetic. Kind of reminds me of side adjusters, but for your wrist. Some other options that I think are extremely nice are the Annex cuff from MainSide, the Rector Gold cuff from MainSide, the Crafted London Classic cuff, and the Sterling Silver Knot cuff from Dex and Sal. Now, before we move into the next accessory, you guys are always asking me how I style my hair, which is why today I've partnered with Blumon. I'm sure you guys have heard of Blumon before. They are a hair products company. They have all types of products for different hair types, but because my hair is curly slash wavy, I'm gonna teach you guys how I style my hair today using their products. So the first things first, I get my hair damp. Usually just come right out the shower, pat dry my hair so it's still damp. This is essential for pre-styling. It's gonna make sure that your products actually work properly. The next step is I go in with their cloud control oil. I take four drops and I apply that through my hair thoroughly. It contains 12 different types of oils essential for healthy hair growth, frizz removal, and hydration. Now after that, I go in with their rebound curl cream, and this is what's going to help you achieve that curly, wet look as well as give you a nice hold. So I use about a quarter sized amount, and I rub it through my hair, and I apply it thoroughly throughout, and I just do this little scrunching motion that helps make more defined curls. And then after that, I just let my hair air dry for about 20 minutes, and you are left with this perfect, curly, wet, hydrated hair look. So if you guys are interested in Blumont's products, actually have a code 10% off if if you use Balfour at checkout. And let's get back to the video. Next accessory every guy needs is a leather wallet. And I've said this before, I personally like to go with loud colors when it comes to my wallet, just because it's so small, it's also easier to find, but it's just kind of a personal preference. A neutral one can also look nice. In terms of designs, my two favorite designs are the card holder and the pocket organizer. They kind of serve different purposes. You might only need one. I personally use both of mine. My credit card holder is just for daily use. And then my pocket organizer is for when I go traveling and I need to hold more cards as well as cash that comes in real handy, and it still maintains a nice slim profile. Now some great options for card holders is the Coach Card Case in signature leather, the APC Andre card holder, the Kenzo Paris Lucky Tiger card holder, the Acne Studios leather card holder, and the Ami Paris card holder. Now for the pocket organizers, a few great options are the Coach card holder wallet, the Bellroy Slimsleeve, Mason Margiela for Stitch's card holder, and the Bottega Veneta flap card holder. Now remember guys, I'm just giving you options. You don't have to buy these. Some guys are gonna be like, oh, this is way too expensive. And then there's guys that watch this channel that are like, okay, I'll buy the most expensive one. So I'm trying to give options for everyone. Don't get upset with me if these are out of your price range. I'm supplying some more affordable ones as well. Now the next accessory is a pair of sunglasses, but not your average pair of sunglasses. A pair of gradient sunglasses. Now I don't know what it is, but personally I think gradient sunglasses look more stylish. It's something about the fact that you can kind of see my eyes that makes it look better than just your average pair. There's probably not many people out there saying this, but I put you guys on this. Get yourself a pair of gradient glasses. These things are way sicker. So because sunglasses are so subjective to your actual face shape, I can't tell you exactly the sunglasses you should buy for yourself, but I'll give you some companies that do have gradient sunglasses. The ones that I'm wearing, and you see me wear all the time from a company called Explicit Poets, they have majority gradient glasses, but they are mainly for slimmer faces. So if you have a wider face, you might wanna look at some of these other brands. Ray-Ban also have some gradient ones. Yes glasses, Carrera sunglasses, Tom Ford has them, Dita, and of course you have the pioneer gradient glasses, Cartier. Now the final accessory is a belt. Now as you guys know, I personally don't wear belts because most of my pants have side adjusters, but majority of you I imagine are going to have out loops. So I suggest you get yourself a black or a brown belt or a cream one depending on which color you wear most often. Something with a nice slim belt buckle. Don't go for any crazy designer brand guys. You don't need to spend a ton of money on a belt. $100 will get you an absolutely fantastic belt. So that is the seven accessories I believe every guy should have.

        "transcript": " I don't even need to explain why dressing well in the gym is important because you guys that follow me already know the importance of dressing well in every situation Especially when your dream crush looks like this half the time at the gym Demand them to consider a five-star hotel smoking I want to be wearing something that is suitable for the approach a man can dream All right, let's be honest most of us aren't gonna go up to our gym crush and approach it in idealistic world We would so let's just stick to the part of looking good So in today's video, I'll be sharing with you guys everything that you need to build a gym wardrobe something that is functional as well as looks good So starting with our pants our first pair of pants is the suit supply wool trouser Could you imagine wearing suit supply wool trousers to the gym you're like I only wear old money aesthetic clothes I was actually a pair of joggers or sweatpants and the sweatpants that I've been using for the past four years are the Abercrombie essential joggers the ones with the cuffs on the bottom extremely soft Rooming the thighs for the boys with the thick thighs and it also allows for decent mobility I stretch in these all the time and I've never had any issues with mobility and in terms of similar sweatpants from other brands We have the chill sweatpants from aloe the steady-state joggers from the lemon Jim shark heavyweight joggers or the everlane Retract sweatpants as well your joggers. I personally use the Lulemon soft jersey tapered pants and the pace breaker pants I'm mad. I've only recently got into the lemon dude. Holy shit. Their stuff is nice specifically their pants I used to think it was only for women. I stepped in there the other day bought these pants I was like, oh What have I been doing this whole time the soft jersey tapered pants just like the name says or the softest most comfortable pants to ever grace my thighs and the pace breaker pants although they're not as soft as a soft tapered jersey pants they do fit extremely well So if you like the more technical look you want the nylon ish polyester material is a really good option now for your alternative options We have the aloe conqueror revitalized pants the Abercrombie YPB Gym to grocery tapered jogger the Gymshark studio joggers and the Nike therma joggers and moving on to our shorts I definitely recommend that you get anywhere between a seven inch to five inch length inseam unless you're Mexican controller then obviously You want to go for a Capri personally myself? I go for a six to five inch because I'm a bit of a slut and in terms of what brand you go for really any of them look pretty Nice you can go for Jim shark Lululemon asrb Abercrombie Nike they've all got great stuff on to our tops starting with the cheapest and my personal favorite item to wear is the Rib tank top the aka the wife lover and the reason being I like the wife lover so much is because they fit extremely well it shows your v-taper they're extremely comfortable and when you get a pump you look absolutely fucking massive because it reveals a lot more of your body obviously I personally get mine from Haynes I think they cost about $19 for a pack of six you do not expect them to be great quality and they're not they're pretty shit actually I just couldn't care to pay more for a tank top and remember if you're buying them you got a size up times two so if you're small go for a large now I get the rib tank top isn't for everyone maybe you're newer to the gym you don't want to be wearing something like that you You don't feel comfortable in it, or you just don't like being a douchebag in general. Then for you, I'd recommend an athletic t-shirt. Key flex, rep shirts are what I like to wear, as well as the Under Armour Men's Heat Gear Short Sleeve. Really nice fit on both of these shirts. The Under Armour one is very well fitted. It is a condom shirt, I mean, compression shirt. And the Nike one is a bit looser of a mesh material. So before we move on to the next item, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor NordVPN.

So if you're my guys that don't even want to show a little bit of bicep or tricep, then obviously you got to be long sleeve is the only other option for you. And I personally don't own one because I tend to get quite warm when I train. But you can go to any of the major workout companies and they'll have a nice long sleeve for you. Next we have our first pump cover, which is the quarter zip. And I personally love to wear the Nike quarter zip. Super comfortable, stretchy, and it's going to help you get your muscles nice and warmed up. And honestly, I think they look quite silish, especially if you get in black. So I definitely recommend that everybody gets one of these for sure. Moving on, everyone's gonna need a generic hoodie or a crew neck For when it is really cold to the quarter zip is more of a spring and fall item is not gonna keep you that warm So if it's cold as mornings, you're probably gonna want something a bit thicker I think the Abercrombie hoodies and crew necks are your best bet when it comes to price fit and quality Now moving down to the feet. I personally have two pairs of shoes now You don't need two pairs of shoes you could definitely get away with one pair of shoes But I like to have two one for my upper body days just a comfortable sneaker I wear the air max 97 and then on my leg days I will use the converse to have the nice flat bottoms now if you're really serious about training you're gonna be doing Sumo's dead lifts squats a lot then maybe for you you might want to look at a proper lifting shoe something like the fast lift power G380s the Nike Romelio for weightlifting shoes or the Reebok Nano X4s And finally we have the hygiene section and a deodorant is an absolute must. I personally wear an antiperspirant Now I know it's not the best to put under your underarms But I rather not smell like shit for the hour or the hour and a half that I'm at the gym So what I'll do is I'll use the old spice antiperspirant I'll put that on for the gym and then when I come home I'll have my shower I wash off that deodorant and then I'll put on my native deodorant which is completely fine now as for a Fragrance is definitely not an essential. I don't wear any fragrance to the gym But if you'd like to wear fragrance to the gym some great options are Chanel alert on sport Mont Blanc legend spirit Versace poor on or Paco Robon Invictus, so I hope you guys enjoyed today's video You have some stuff that you can now wear to the gym Everything will be linked in the description below if you'd like to shop and I'll catch you guys in the next video"

        "transcript": " Come on in boys. Welcome to the new apartment All right right off the rip you come straight into this open concept kitchen, which is incredible This is one of the best parts about this place is that the whole layout of this entire apartment is very open concept over here We have fridge believe it or not It's actually a hidden fridge as you can see we have absolutely nothing in here Ryder and I never eat we just starve ourselves Fat be fast we do actually fast for quite a long time like most of the days We're not eating until about four o'clock, and then that's it. We just eat one meal steak or pizza Pizza's what gets you shredded anyways over here finally. I've wanted a gas stove for so long I've just been using induction and if you guys know anything about cooking steaks in order to cook a nice steak You almost need a flame so that you can Nothing's burning when you're basting your butter on top you can keep the flame on it with it when you have an induction one You take it off and there's no heat because you have to have contact with the burner at all times So absolutely love that we finally got a gas stove over here. We have an air fryer It took me 22 years to get an air fryer. I didn't even know they existed But this is literally a blessing rather than I use this all the time This is basically what we use to make our food whenever we do eat We just throw it in the air for our leave it, keep working, come back and it's done. And over here we also have a microwave as well as more cupboard space and usually we just eat here. We don't typically eat in our little dining area. We usually just stand here and we eat our food like that. Alright, coming over here we are in the workstation. This is where Brandon does his work. He does his editing. He does his meetings. He does his scripting. He does his purchasing of his clothes. to the right here you will see the arch mirror that you see me take my selfies in in the mornings when i give you guys the links it's just like this bang perfect lighting coming from the window here actually all around this building is like 100 windows so it's perfect lighting in here at all times now moving over here we have a fake plant i'm kind of in a dilemma right now i don't know whether i should buy fake plants or real plants i do have two real plants which we'll get to after and they seem to be dying and it's not because of my lack of due diligence it's actually just because They fucking hate me. I don't know why anyways, so we got a fake plant over here on top of the desk We have the watch winder. This is a watch grinder my brother got for me for Christmas You guys saw that in one of my videos recently. We have the 365 day journal this is where all the scripting gets done. I still like to do my stuff on paper I don't really like to do it on Docs I just prefer to sit there with a pen in the right and just makes it a lot easier And I also remember things better that way the actual monitor that all the work gets done on is an LG 38-inch ultra-wide monitor. We have a Logitech mouse as well as this K2 keychrone Look at that. We have a Ferrari Novitech absolutely beautiful car That is the dream vehicle right there and then underneath we have the money mat Which obviously has put here because this is where all the money is made This is actually from AliExpress if you guys want actually any decor whatsoever go on AliExpress You can get tons of different things on there You just have to be willing to potentially wait your lifetime to receive them. That's all so chair IKEA Desktop is actually from Home Depot. So this isn't come together These are vivo legs I bought those off of Amazon and then I just took a countertop from Home Depot and I placed that on top and then the The actual workhorse is the Apple MacBook M1 Max. And yeah, that's my desk. Nothing too fancy, just pretty simple. That's where all the work gets done. Moving on over here, we have a $2,000 blank. No, it's actually 2,000 yen probably. This is again from AliExpress. I don't know why I bought this. I kind of just fell into the hype of the Hermes blankets and I'm like, I'm not gonna drop two grand on a fucking blanket, that's ridiculous. Underneath the blanket, we have this Zara Home. This is a Zara home, a blue clay chair. Just got this in the corner. Absolutely beautiful, super aesthetic. Behind we have one of the real plants and it's doing quite well over here. And I think the reason one of our other plants is dying is mainly just because it's not hot enough in here. We don't really have, dude, the fact that you're like leaning in so hard right now is making me laugh. It's hurting my forearm. Guys dying behind the camera. He's got a full rig in his hand. I don't even know what I would say. Moving on to this, which is this absolutely spectacular view outside, we have a 200 square feet patio, which doesn't have anything, because I only recently moved in here a month and a half ago, as you guys know. So I don't even have any outdoor patio stuff yet, but we plan on doing quite nice outdoor patio set, barbecue, maybe some of the artificial grass as well. Absolutely spectacular. We have virtually no buildings in front of us. So we get this like almost 180 degree view of the mountains. It's quite the scene. Just stand here and scream. Ah! Yo, do you hear that echo? Yeah, that's crazy. I've never done that before. But as you can see, if you take a look above, the ceiling here is ridiculously high. I think it goes up to about 25 feet. And that's one of the main things that I love about this place is the fact that we have extremely high ceilings. So we'll come back in. There's also another door here, which you can go in through that way, but in order to do this tour, I'm gonna come in through this way. but he just transported. He just teleported over there. All right, so moving on into the best part of this apartment, which is the living room. This is where all the boys can come over and hang out. And the really nice thing about the kitchen actually is the fact that you can be all the way in the kitchen and I can still talk with you way over here. I've never had that experience. Ryder, go all the way back. So I can literally sit all the way over here and I can talk with Ryder. It's absolutely incredible. I love the open concept. But anyway, get your ass over here. So as you can see, it is floor to ceiling windows, which was my ideal apartment when I was creating my dream life, when I was journaling. This is exactly what I envisioned for this place. You're flooded with light at all times, so it doesn't really matter what time of day it is, apart from night, you come down here and it's almost like the sun is in the fucking building. Moving over here, one of our favorite parts, something that I personally installed, don't tell my landlord, because they might kill me, is this projector screen, because I didn't want to get a TV. I wanted to have, you know, just completely open concept. I didn't want anything blocking the view. So we have this projector screen, which I have a projector that I roll out, connect my laptop to, and we just project it on here. We haven't really experienced it in the summertime, which is gonna be a bit difficult, obviously. It's gonna be lighter. So we'll just have to push our movies a little bit later. Moving over here, one of my favorite parts about this apartment is the statue of my penis. As you can see, the length of the girth is all the same. They just put this here to accentuate how grandiose This place really is, as you can see. Pretty realistic. Don't ask me how I fit it in my pants. A magician never reveals his tricks. Over here, we have this that I bought from Wayfarer and it's not actually supposed to go like this. I made this to be this way, because it looked kind of cool. It actually is supposed to go lengthwise along the ground. These are two separate things, but I put them together to make this little shelf over here. Marshall speaker, some decor pieces, a light. I've also got LEDs that run along the top of the windows as well as along the back here, which you're not gonna be able to see obviously because it is daytime. And then another thing that is absolutely exceptional about this place is this beautiful couch. This came from undisclosed location. I'm gonna gate keep this one, I'm kidding. I bought this from a place called Scan Design. My brother used to work there and this is called the Madrid sectional and it is a modular couch. So all these pieces move individually, which is amazing. When the boys come over, this whole thing can be turned into a circle if we want. We could literally sit, have the fucking campfire in the middle. Over here, I get a lot of questions about this specific blanket. Again, another AliExpress piece. I buy almost everything you're gonna see in here decor-wise from AliExpress. It's a stussy blanket, don't know if it's real. It just looks really nice. This as well, this knotted pillow. Again, from AliExpress. We have this lamp here, which is from Ikea. And it just fits perfectly into this space because we wanted something that would come over top and that is the ideal lamp for this location. On the walls here, you will see I am a Porsche whore, for some reason, it just seems to be everywhere in this place. Porsche 911 Turbo, also from AliExpress, and they're just framed in some Ikea frames. On here we got another Porsche 911 Turbo Lego, Ryder and I set this up, and we haven't played with Lego since we were children, and we didn't realize how fricking long these things take to build. It actually took us like a full eight hours to build with the two of us. And underneath, Tom Ford book, yeah, basic bitch. Moving over here, these are actually night stands from my room, they are from Zara home as well. And I just thought that it would look really, really nice in this corner, because I actually have a bunch of nightstands already. Cause a lot of this stuff actually came from my previous place that I was living in. We just moved a lot of this stuff over. This gets a lot of questions. And this is a multi tray, again from AliExpress, just a valet tray. Another lamp there, our half dead palm tree. This is the one that I was talking about. It's like almost dead. I don't know what is going on with it. It's got serious issue. looks sick, all the freaking leaves are just falling. And I am watering it. And it's not like you need to water these a lot. They're palms, they're meant to be in hot weather, which might be the reason, because it's quite cold in here. Then we got Mirror on the Wall Ferrari F40. Over here, we have the dining table. And like I said, we usually eat over there. We rarely touch this spot. And when we're watching a movie, we have Amelia Fanati's night. Sit here and watch it on the projector screen. So this table here is just an Ikea table. Can't remember the exact name. I also got some Ikea chairs, some decor pieces, Rolex book, and some placemats from China. They're not actually from China. Everybody just assumes they're from China because they got, maybe this isn't even Chinese. So we haven't even thought about that before. What if it's like a different language? They're just like, that's Chinese. I don't know. It's probably is Chinese, but they always say, did you buy that in China? I say yes, because it makes the story a bit better, but they were bought from here. Moving over here, we have Ryder's bedroom. Bed's just back there. Yeah, way in the back. Now we actually used to rent this out to Harry Potter. It's up. Now. Long time ago, but he moved out into a bigger place now. He's doing quite well for himself. Moving over here, we have another closet. Nothing special to see, just my shoes, just mine, not Ryder's. Ryder has to keep his shoes in his bedroom upstairs. His mind takes up the whole closet. And then just over here, just a regular, you know, powder room, nothing special. Now we go upstairs, because there is two floors to this apartment, which is absolutely sick. Let's go. So come here. This is Ryder's bedroom, the full-time editor's bedroom. You wanna give him a tour of your bedroom? No, no. So this is Ryder's bed. It is a single bed frame because he's a small dude and this guy can barely lift like 10 pounds. So he had to go for the IKEA single mom bed, little side table there, his workstation. This is where I tell him his work sucks when he's sitting here. You're fired. You're fired! Move out! So then over here, you got his closet. And behind the door, you have a hidden washroom that always smells like shit because Ryder likes to take dumps. You gotta close this down, you can never leave this open. So then, yeah, just Ryder's washroom, shower, you know, just a basic washroom. Now we come into the master bedroom. This is where I arise every day. We'll come over here first. So as you can see, ow, these are all my closets. Finally, I have a space for my clothes. I actually don't have that many clothes, believe it or not. Right now, you can take a look. I don't have as much as you guys probably thought I'd have because I have rebuilt my wardrobe from scratch. I only bought back things that I'm actually going to wear all the time, so I don't have a lot. Probably should have out of their closet. No, no, that's okay. So I'm like super full. Well, it looks super full, but there's not that much in there. It's not like Alex Costas wardrobe or anything. All right, moving on to the master washroom. This is absolutely massive. We got a his and hers sink. This is where I do my skincare routine. This is where I do the Flexsoft to make sure I'm still making gains. And the lighting's actually sick too. This light right here is absolutely perfect for the downloading. I'll do a montage of me flexing. Over here, we have quite a grand shower, easily large enough to fit three girls in here at the same time. So if there's any girls watching my videos, You know, my washroom and my shower is quite large. Moving over here to the master bedroom. Take a look first before we even look over there at the windows of this place. I mean, Ryder's also got a sick view in there, which I probably should have showed. But he's got a sick view in his room as well. This whole place has been set up for views. I don't know if you'll be able to see Ryder's bedroom, but it's right there. So when he's sleeping in the morning and he hasn't woken up and I'm like, Ryder, get up. What the hell is taking so long? It's time to work. You're so working. Time to start working. Over here we have this, I actually bought this on Facebook Marketplace. It is the Togo couch, but it's like a fake version as well. I ain't gonna pay like $1,000 for a freaking foam chair. On top we just got some Alex Hormozzi books that I'm currently reading, as well as The Holy Bible, which I read every night before bed. Little stand over here just for this section. I'll typically do any reading just over here. I prefer to do it over here than in my bed, because then I'll probably just fall asleep. And come over here so you can see how big this freaking bed is and how nice this is. Brand new bed. I actually just assembled this yesterday. Didn't buy this. I actually got this sent to me from Article, but I did a collab with them and it is this beautiful raw hide tan colorway. It's the same color as my bag. But as you can see, I love brown. All of a sudden I just have decided I like brown and brown's my favorite color. So everything I'm buying nowadays is just brown. We got an aotted pillow right here. Everybody loves this as well. Again, AliExpress want any cushions, any decor pieces, AliExpress. Over here we have this side table I bought from Simons. It's actually acrylic as you can see is fully see-through. And I got a Porsche book here and some rings, some accessories, you know, a little plant. And then the Porsche art, this is actually metal. And my friend Thomas bought this for me, but you can buy this on Etsy from the sellers. Super sick. This is like a really unique decor piece. And then we just got this here. I'm not fully done decorating this place guys. You'll see that I have some things on the floors just cause we're not fully finished yet. So I still wanna hang that up, probably put it on the wall over here. Over here, we got the YouTube subscriber plaque. Extremely proud of this. It's not even that long ago and we'd hit 100K and then now we're at 500,000, which is absolutely absurd. The only reason I'm in this place like this is because of you guys. I didn't have you, obviously I have to produce good content, but if I didn't have you guys supporting me, just a solid following, I wouldn't be able to live in a place like this. And then over here, we just have a mirror. It doesn't really get used. I use that mirror downstairs to look at myself. That is the entire apartment tour. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you enjoyed it, please smash the like button, drop a subscribe if you haven't already, and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " So you guys gave me absolute crap in my old money winter video saying, We're gonna do the spring and summer essentials video too. You should make one for spring and summer time. So I made the video and I'm definitely the first YouTuber within this space to actually make the spring 2024 video. So don't ever say I've done nothing for you. You're going nowhere. I got you for three old minutes. Three minutes of playtime. However, this video will not just be old money styles. There will be a variety of different styles for you guys to choose from. And as always, all the links to the items I showed today will be in the description below. Let's get into this video. So, starting with our pants. Name of the game is lightweight. Baby! So that being said, the first pair of pants you're gonna want are some lightweight cotton trousers. My personal choice are these white suit supply trousers. Cut to absolute perfection. And these will perfectly go with any of your dressy attire. They don't need to be suit supply. They could just be any cotton trouser that looks nice and slim fit. Next up, you need some linen pants. An absolute essential for anywhere that is going to get hot in the springtime. The little extra breeze that you get in your non-sack is worth the extra money. Color-wise, you'll need a few so that you have options to go with your tops, white, beige, black, and olive, and I would buy them in that order if you're going to get all four. Now, depending on what you like to wear, you have an option of different fits. You got the one with the drawstring, which is typically going to be a lot breezier. It's going to be a more loose fit. And then if you like the Udmoney aesthetic style, you could go for your more tailored linen suit trouser, like these ones. Moving on, nothing screams spring more than some light blue denim jeans. You wanna make sure that you get a really nice light wash because these are gonna be easiest to style with other colors. Now if you get something that's a bit too dark, it's a lot more difficult to pair with other colors. And yes, I did say colors. I will be wearing colors throughout this video. I will be wearing colors throughout spring and summertime. I know it's weird. I'm not gonna be wearing shades. I'm actually going to throw in some greens and some blues. A final pair of pants that you'll want is either a cream denim or a white denim. Now assuming that you're probably gonna pick up a white and either your linen trousers or one of your cotton trousers, I would just go for the cream denim. and this is gonna serve as your pants for your more casual outfits. Now, moving into our short-sleeved tops, you're going to need some nice t-shirts. Now, the t-shirts you could buy could be like the ones that I really like are the knit versions. It's a knit crew neck t-shirt. They look a lot more sophisticated, a lot more classy, but they are quite a bit more expensive. So if you don't have the large budget, then I would just go for some unique loaties because most of the time, you're gonna be wearing something over this anyways in the spring. Now, because spring and summer is a time that we get a little bit more vibrant, we try to match the environment. would be on our hot girl summer vibes. You're definitely gonna wanna pick up some vibrant camp color shirts and some pattern camp color shirts. Now you got lots of options when it comes to the material choice. You could go for a crochet knit one as a really beautiful texture. You could go for a linen one. You want something that's lightweight and that's breezy. And then you also got the polyester version. It's just nice and flowy. Next up, I recommend buying some sweater polos. The ultimate spring essential. Once again, just like your camp color shirts, you got lots of options when it comes to design choice. You could get ribbed for her pleasure. or you could get something fun pattern like this green one. And moving into our long sleeves and sweaters, because spring is not always going to be sunshine and rainbows. There's gonna be days where your nips can cut through glass. So that being said, our first long sleeve is going to be the long sleeve sweater polo. And now you got two options when it comes to which design you want. You could go for the Johnny collar, which is the typical one you guys see me wear, just the V-haller without the buttons. But I also did just pick up these ones from Ralph Loren with the buttons. It's in this mesh material, so it's nice and lightweight. And I love the blue color. just works so perfectly for spring. The next thing you'll need is some lightweight button down shirts for your formal outfits. I'd definitely suggest you pick up a few colors. I'd get one in blue or one in green, and then I would go for your basic white and black. Material wise, you could go for linen if you need the breeziness, if it gets a little bit cooler in the springtime for you, then go for a cotton or a mesh material. If you want something extremely stylish and versatile for the cooler days, we have the navy long sleeve polo cardigan. Not this bullshit. This. Much nicer, no? Very similar to the sweater polo, but slightly thinner with buttons that go down the center, creating this absolute masterpiece of a garment. Now, moving into our sweaters, you'll want some thin quarter zips or some zipped cotton cardigans for when it's quite brisk out. Now, as long as you keep these thin, like the ones that I'm showing here, you shouldn't overheat in these. You can just rock them with a lightweight tee underneath paired with your denim or your cotton trousers, and you will be absolutely fine. Our final item before we move into the footwear section is the Gilles. Again, you want to keep it thin and not overly bulky. And you can really pair these with every single item that we discussed previously. Your short sleeves, your long sleeves, your sweaters, they will pair perfectly. Got a few options too when it comes to material choice. You can go for a suede, you can go for a nylon. You could even go for a cotton as well. Into our footwear, your boys need to pick up a suede loafer. How many times do I need to tell you this guys? Look at how sexy these things are. These are the brand new suit supply suede loafers and the light toe, probably the easiest colorway to style. I also have the light brown, the dark brown, and the navy as well, because these are the ultimate shoe for the spring and the summertime. Now, these are not cheap by any means, guys. I know they're not cheap, but I have yet to find one with the same materials Italian calf suede for cheaper. Now, if you guys know of one, let me know, bro, because I would love to save money too. But as of right now, I have not found any other brand that sells the same type of materials for a better price. The next thing you want is an ice pair of sandals. Stop walking, your flip flops, your thongs, whatever you call them, they look like shit. Buy yourself an ice pair of sandals. I found these Steve Madden ones. They're called the Mavens. They look super classy. You can actually wear these with your formal outfits too. And it's basically the poor Madden's version of the Hermes ones. I don't know if you guys have seen the Hermes ones before, but they're like a million dollars. So save yourself a million dollars, buy these ones from Steve Madden. They look exactly the same, probably not as comfortable, but these are only a hundred bucks and they're gonna get wet and get sand on it and shit anyway. So why would you buy the Hermes ones? Final shoe is obvious. It's the white sneaker. There's only one that I'm ever going to recommend to you guys. This is the best slim leather sneaker on the market. The Axlera Gato Clean 90s. Now moving into our fragrances, You're gonna want something that is light, something that is fresh, citrusy, aquatic, soapy. It's clean because you don't wanna be wearing any of your winter and fall fragrances in the spring and summertime. It's just going to be too much. So some really great options are like Chanel, Elur, Alm Sport, O Extreme, Dior Alm Sport, Aqua de Geo Profondo, Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Intense, Hermes H24, and Fico de Amalfi by Aqua de Parma. And that is everything that you need to have an absolutely perfect spring wardrobe that will last you for years to come. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, please drop it a like and comment, and I will catch you guys in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " If you've been following me for a while, you've probably got a pretty solid wardrobe by now. I think we have the Ralph and Mesh shirt. You may also be broke, but you may not know when to wear these certain items that you have because obviously certain occasions call for certain outfits. You're not gonna show up to hang out with the boys in a suit and tie, just like you're not gonna go for your first job interview in a clubbing outfit. So I've created 10 outfits for 10 different occasions that I believe the average person will go to at some point in time. FYI, all the links to the items that I show in today's video will be in the description below. So starting with our first occasion, and we have the fancy dinner. Now when you think of a fancy dinner, you're thinking evening time, dim lighting, candle lit. So what you wanna do is embody that into an outfit. I like to choose darker colors, so I go with either navy or black. I wear a nice button down shirt with a pair of trousers and some loafers. And when it comes to accessories, I'd probably go with a watch. If you like rings, maybe you can add two rings as well. And remember, if you're there with a woman, you wanna make sure, I mean, regardless if you're there with a woman or not, I would still do this, but if you're there with a woman, make sure that you're rolling up those sleeves so those forearm veins are popping. cause you can imagine you choke slamming her onto the fucking bed. Kidding, only with consent. And for your fragrance, I'd go with something a bit seductive, a bit mysterious. So out of my personal collection, I'd probably choose Tom Ford and Noir or YSL Tuxedo. Next occasion we have is the club. Now I know you, you're gonna be busting up a move on the dance floor, so you're gonna be sweating up a storm. Okay, more realistically, you're probably just be jumping up and down doing fucking nothing but bobbing your head. You're still gonna sweat, so you wanna make sure you're wearing something that's breathable, that gives you mobility, like a cap color shirt, maybe a crochet shirt. And I personally go with a bright color or something that is patterned because it's just cooler most dudes in the club Which is wearing black and super boring you're not gonna stand out if you just wear black so wear something That's pattern that's colorful and as for your pants Maybe go for denim or go for a drawstring Trouser something that is still gonna give you mobility as for your shoes a sneaker that you do not care about getting puked on Stepped on spit on nutted on puked on I'm personally still gonna wear white sneaker You guys know me I just wear white sneakers at all times But if you're smart you'd probably wear something like a converse truck tail or something that's cheap as black that you don't really care Too much about having to replace accessory wise you can go with as many as you'd like and as for your fragrance You're gonna want to go with something that is kind of sweet that's citrusy I'd go for like ultra male or go for Sachi Eros on today. Next one. We have the coffee date now The coffee shop kind of gives me warm cozy vibe So you want to match that again with your outfit so I'd go for colors that are warmer like whites creams Cans, browns, olives. So I'd personally go with something like a capel knit sweater with a gelet over top and then a pair of blue denim jeans and some sneakers. Now this isn't overly casual, but it's not overly dressed up either for the occasion. I think it suits it perfectly. And then when it comes to your fragrance, you're gonna wanna go again for something that is warm, maybe something boozy like Mason Margiela Jazz Club, your ome or Bentley for men. And as for your accessories, a watch, maybe two rings, whatever you feel comfortable with. Next occasion, we got hanging out with the boys. Now, mobility is going to be key with this occasion because you never know what the fuck you're gonna get up to with boys. We're in the sewers of France right now. What type of adventure you're gonna go on? We're in the Venice Canals right now. What type of terrain you're gonna endure, but you still wanna look fly. So when it comes to the pants, I personally choose something that looks like a nice trouser, but is actually something that is very stretchy. So if I have to make some crazy maneuver, I can do it and I end up splitting my pants open or eating shit. On top, I usually just go with a T-shirt with a quarter zip for my shoes. You gotta get something that's virtually indestructible. The new Balance 550 is that sneaker for me. And then for your fragrance, signature fragrance, unless you want to seduce the boys and go for the date night fragrance. If you're not doing something a little bit suss every once in a while, are you guys really friends? Like, let's be honest. And as for your accessory wise, wear whatever you'd like. The next occasion is the beach slash picnic occasion. And linen is going to be your go-to choice for a fabric if it is extremely hot. Now, when you're going on a beach date, you're gonna wanna have your swim trunks on, obviously. And as for your top, I'd go for a either a long sleeve linen shirt or a short sleeve linen shirt. And then obviously you're gonna need some sunglasses as well. Accessory wise, I probably just go with a necklace unless you wanna end up losing rings and stuff like that in the ocean. And then on your feet, just some sandals. Now for the picnic, you could go for the linen shirt as well. Or you could go for a sweater polo. As for your pants, I'd go with a nice linen trouser or a lightweight cotton trouser. For your shoes, either sandals, suede loafers, or sneaker. For your accessories, a casual watch, maybe two rings, a pendant necklace. And for your fragrance, So just want to go for something that's fresh and light, like Dolce and Gabbana, light blue and 10, or Aqua de Geo Profondo, or even Joe Malone, Wood Sage and Sea Salt. Next up, we have the church outfit. Now, if you're not Christian, feel free to skip this, but for me, God is a massive part of my life, so I go to church and I also dress up very nicely for church. I wear a nice button down shirt with a pair of trousers and some loafers when it's a bit colder and I can't just wear that. I'll usually throw one of my Wooler cashmere sweaters over top. As for my accessories, I just wear a watch and in my fragrance, I wear my signature fragrance, your home. The next occasion we have is the brunch date. Now the brunch date is very similar to the coffee date in regards to you want to wear warmer colors. Now the difference between the two is you want to wear trousers instead of wearing denim jeans. As for your upper layers, it's going to depend on the weather obviously, but I'd go for either a short sleeve sweater polo or a long sleeve sweater polo. Then I would add a gelette on top for your footwear. Go with a nice slim leather sneaker or a suede loafer. For your accessories, just a nice casual watch and two rings and for your fragrance, it's going to be the same as the coffee date. The next occasion we got is the job interview. Now for the job interview, absolute bare minimum. You wanna be showing up in a white button down shirt with a pair of trousers, either gray or navy. For your shoes, you wanna wear a formal shoe. And for your watch, go with a nice dress watch, either on a leather strap or a silver band. And for your fragrance, just go in with your signature fragrance. And this is the absolute bare minimum, like I said, guys. You always wanna go into a job interview dressing nicely to make the best first impression. Now, if you're gonna be wearing suits for most of the time, then obviously show up in a suit. Next occasion we got is the gym. Now I'm not gonna make a gym outfit for the douchebags like me because then you just be wearing a tank top and sweatpants, that's what I usually wear. I'm talking about your average Joe Schmoe gymgoer who's more conservative and just wants to wear something that's decent to the gym, that's not too revealing. And I would personally go with a pair of joggers from either Under Armour Nike Lulemon and then an athletic shirt on top from any of those previous brands. And then also a quarter zip to go over top of that when you're warming up again from any of those previous brands. Now for your shoes, you just wanna wear anything that you're actually gonna feel comfortable training in. And as for your scent, I personally just go with deodorant. I don't wear any fragrance because it can be a bit too much sometimes in the gym. But if you really wanna go with a fragrance, I would suggest Chanel Allure Aumspark. That is 10 different outfits for 10 different occasions. If you guys enjoyed this video, please drop the video a like. And if you want another one of these, drop some different occasions that you guys go to in the comment section below. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " Today, I'll be teaching you guys how to achieve the old money aesthetic for winter. Dude, I absolutely hate that term so much. I'm literally just using it for search terms. Let's change the name of it to dressing elegantly in the modern era because we aren't exactly trying to copy this style. Old money aesthetic comes from generational wealth and unless you guys are trust fund babies, which I assume most of you aren't, we're not trying to copy this exactly because if you were trying to, you'd be rocking suits, field jackets, wearing gloves, you'd have a Rolls Royce umbrella and you'd be rocking a side part 24-7. What we're trying to do is take certain aspects from this style and make it more applicable to this day and age. But this is how you do it. The key foundations of this style goes as follows. Number one, neutral colors. Number two, slim fitted silhouettes. Number three, high quality fabrics. And number four is minimalism. So starting with our neutral colors, for those of you that don't know, our different shades of blacks, whites, navies, grays, beiges, browns, charcoal, and desaturated greens like olive and burgundy. And the reason for this is that each color will match its counterpart or go very nicely with it. Next is slim fitted silhouettes. Now this is the downfall for a lot of people because they don't pay attention to the thickness of the materials that they're purchasing. So if we take a look at Ralph Laurence purple label runway photos, which by the way, if you don't know what the purple label is, this is the epitome of old money styles. But even with multiple layers on, they still achieve and maintain a slim fit silhouette. Nothing is overly bulky. So you have to stay very conscious of the thickness and the fit of the materials that you're purchasing. To give you an example of something that would instantly put you out of the aesthetic would be like my North Face puffer jacket. This is way too bulky. But if we take a look at this overcoat outfit, I'm wearing two more layers underneath and it's still slimmer than that puffer jacket. So to reiterate, make sure that you're spending money on items that are slim fit and not super thick because you're gonna want to layer with these and still maintain a slim profile. And the next rule is high quality fabrics. Now, as we discussed before, this is different types of wools, cashmere, suede linens and high quality cotton. Now there is an exception to this rule because just cause you can't afford to purchase wool and cashmere, doesn't mean you can't achieve this style. Because after all, this is just a style and this is something that you can achieve with different types of fabrics. As long as you have the rest of the foundational blocks, you still will be able to achieve this style. And that brings us to our fourth one, which is minimalism. So you wanna make sure that any of the pieces that you are purchasing, it doesn't have any crazy branding on it, even better, none at all. Now, just because we are going minimalistic, doesn't mean you can't deal with intricate knits, clads, or corduroy, because those are actually key for achieving this style. But anything that is similar to a graphic is a violation of the code, your fucking ex-communicado, bud. Now that the ground rules have been laid, let's get into what items you specifically need to build this aesthetic for winter. Starting with our pants. You are going to mainly stick to trousers and chinos. You actually can get away with denim as long as they are cream or a lighter colored denim because they can be dressed up. I personally prefer wearing pleated trousers. You can get away with really any trouser and it's gonna do as long as it's slim. Now moving into our sweaters, our first sweater is the cable knit. Now you guys know you can get these in various different styles. You can get them in quarter zips, crew necks, sweater polos, turtle necks and mock necks. Now I do advise that you buy these in either wool or cashmere because the whole purpose of a sweater is to keep you warm. But also remember to keep this thin because you're going to be layering with various jackets as well. Our second sweater is a thin cashmere or wool sweater. Exactly what I'm wearing. These are typically worn with a shirt underneath. And the nice thing about it is it's thin. You can wear these in the springtime. You can wear these in the fall and it works and it's not too hot. The next sweater is the quarter zip. One of my personal favorites is definitely a preppy looking item. It's super easy to style just like our thin cashmere or wool sweater. It's also easy to style in some of the warmer months as well. And our final sweater is the turtleneck slash mock neck. Now these sweaters are going to be utilized a lot within your wardrobe due to the fact that they are the prepiest item that money can buy, even by itself just worn with some trousers. It looks fantastic. But are you gonna take it up a notch when you start throwing on your jackets? That's when the outfit really starts to come together. And speaking of jackets, Starting with our first and most casual jacket is the gelet. Now with the gelet, you need to be very careful. You don't wanna go overly puffy with this item because you easily can. Most of these are extremely puffy and that's gonna take timelessness away from this item. Well, you can definitely get away with like a slim nylon puffer gelet. The best options, but are often very difficult to find and can be extremely expensive, are the fabric ones. The ones that are made out of wools, cashmere, cotton, suede. Having it in any of these materials is going to instantly make the item look less casual and more elegant. And the gelet is probably my personal favorite jacket to wear on a warmer winter, fall or spring day. It's super easy to style. You just put it on with any of those sweaters that we talked about before and you got sick of it. Before we move into the next item, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, AG1. If you're somebody who prioritizes looking good and feeling good, AG1 is your drink. AG1 is a meticulously crafted blend of vitamins, probiotics and whole food goodness that is a game changer for your brain, gut and immune system. With just one scoop a day, you'll receive mental clarity, sustained focus, and an energy boost that lasts. AG1 isn't just a supplement, it's a lifestyle choice that supports your daily performance and promotes healthy aging. No artificial sweeteners, no added sugars, just pure natural flavoring of pineapple and vanilla, which is great for me because I am extremely picky eater and this tastes pretty good. Within their set, you'll also get the vitamin D3K2 drops, which you'll receive 1000 IU of D3, which if you live in a place like me, where it's not very sunny most of the year, D3 is essential because you're most likely deprived and also 100 MCGs of K2. So if you are interested in AG1, click the link in the description below to snag a free one year supply of AG vitamin D3 plus K2 and five AG1 travel packs with your first AG1 purchase. Let's get back to the video. The next jacket is the shirt jacket, which is kind of like an over shirt. You can get them plain, you can get them as suede, or you can get them in plaid, they look fantastic. Once again, it is key to make sure that this is slim fit because if it is overly big, it is going to look way too casual. To give you an example of the difference in fit, on the right here we have one from Zara and on the left we have one from Ralph Lauren. Now, although these look very similar in style, as you can clearly see, the Ralph Lauren one has a lot more shavings, cut much more nicely. Now, the Zara one looks pretty good too, but it's just gonna be more casual. That's not to say that you can't take this to the tailor and get it altered to look like the Ralph Lauren one. You totally should if you don't have the money to buy a frickin' Ralph Lauren purple label. When it comes to styling this piece, nice cable knit, a thin one, a turtleneck, a mock neck. It's going to look fantastic. And if you want to take it up a notch, you can tuck in this shirt jacket and button the top three buttons, roll up the sleeves a bit, and you're going to be able to expose the sweater underneath, and it's a pretty cool look. Now the next jacket we have is the Hybrid Cardigan jacket. Now this thing is sick because you get the best of both worlds. You get a knit sweater, and you get a gelet all in one. I will warn you guys though, these do come fairly slim, and it can't be extremely difficult to layer something underneath like a sweater because it is so slim. but to be fair, it does look great with just a shirt underneath as well. Now, number four is the shearling jacket. Two of my personal favorite styles. You got one in the brown leather and you got one in suede. These are baller jackets. You got bloody Shawn the sheep on your shoulders. It's gonna keep you nice and warm, dude. It is a sick jacket. Next up, you're going to need a coat. Now, personal preference is going to play a big role here. You can either go for an overcoat, a P coat, or a trench coat. The one thing you gotta keep in mind is the fit. If you are on the shorter side like myself, you are 5'10 and below, you're gonna wanna make sure that you're either buying yourself a P coat or an overcoat that stops at the bottom of your thigh. Now if you're taller than that, as usual, you're chilling, you lucky bastard. Next jacket we have is the Field Jacket. Now these jackets stop around the mid thigh and it's going to be typically scrunched at the middle of your waist to give the jacket some nice shape. It has a simple, functional design that embodies the sense of refined simplicity and is the perfect blend between casual and sophisticated. Now our final jacket is the Quilted Jacket. and I personally don't own one of these yet, as I don't feel that it quite suits my age, although I can definitely appreciate this item. This item is the epitome of old money, as quilted jackets often have heritage that can be traced back to the traditional English countryside attire. Now, if I was 28 plus, I would definitely get one of these in my wardrobe for sure. Now let's talk about footwear. And once again, because we are not copying and we're taking inspiration, I think a nice minimal suede sneaker, a leather sneaker, is going to be perfect for young people who want to achieve this style without having to wear like monk strap shoes and boots. I would definitely consider picking up a brown suede sneaker and a white and black leather sneaker. These should cover all of your semi-formal and casual outfits. Now, if you don't mind looking more mature and you wanna be more true to the style, then you can look at chukka boots, monk straps, leather loafers, or even Chelsea boots. And at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter on how old you are. You're going to need some sort of dress up shoe anyways. So any of those will do except for the chukka boots. Those are more casual. Oh, that is everything you need to achieve this style. If you guys are looking for these items that I'm wearing, it's all gonna be in the description below. And if you are in a place that's hot and you can't wear this, I've got this video that I did recently on the old money aesthetic for summertime. So I hope you enjoyed today's video. If you did, enjoy it, please smash the like button and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See you."

        "transcript": " Last year I traveled abroad six times so although you guys know me as Brandon Balfour on the streets my nickname is Christopher Columbus Now when I go on these trips you guys know me I like to be fly wherever I go However, I only like to bring what I need so most of the time I'm only doing short one to two week trips So I'm usually only coming with a carry-on and a personal bag Now the nice thing about traveling in this way is you don't have to worry about the airline losing your luggage Damaging it or having to wait around that fucking carousel for like 20 minutes for it to show up So I'm quite the expert when it comes to packing lights So today I'm gonna share with you guys some of the hacks that I have found that have allowed me to pack light But also bring everything I need as well as review this sexy ass suitcase from our video sponsor today Sterling Pacific So starting with our two major items We have our carry-on suitcase and we have our duffel bag and starting with the duffel bag This is the coach metropolitan 1941 duffel bag and I personally like to travel with a duffel bag over a backpack I find you can just fit a lot more in it as well as when you get to the fucking TSA checkpoint and the guys screaming at you like a drill sergeant Look, get your shoes off take off your fucking belt Get your laptops on the conveyor belt It's so much easier to just grab stuff out super quickly and you don't have to worry about that dude Because you're like the first person getting your stuff out and I use this duffel bag as my personal item I put all of my electronics in it and a few clothes But it's mainly for the electronics and I put this underneath the seat in front of me so I can have that close to me at all times. Now moving on to our second piece of luggage which is this absolutely stunning refined sterling Pacific 505 II aluminum 35 liter cabin travel case. This thing is incredible. A little bit about the company, sterling Pacific specializes in creating the perfect aluminum luggage with attention to detail tailored to frequent fliers, pilots and other aluminum travel case enthusiasts. Now taking a quick look at this suitcase, it is the definition of class and sophistication. It feels unlike no other suitcase I've ever touched before is unbelievably sturdy and durable. However, it is aluminum, so it is gonna get scratched, it is going to get dented, but if you don't have any battle scars, it shows that you've done nothing. If your suitcase looks perfect, means you don't really travel that much. You also never have to worry about the suitcase becoming unfunctional because they have designed it in a way so that if it were to get dented and stuff, it's not going to affect its function whatsoever. And they've also got a lifetime warranty, so you don't have to worry. Almost every single piece of the suitcase is made from aluminum, the trolley handle, the trolley housing, and even the wheel caps. It's made from 5052 aluminum, like I said, and it is reinforced with A380 aluminum covers, which most companies actually opt for plastic parts here. It also has impact bearing ridges for an added layer of protection to make sure that your stuff stays safe. And something that I absolutely love about this case that you cannot ignore is the handles. Look at it, it is wrapped with beautiful Italian full grain leather. There's no other suitcase on the market that looks this freaking good. And taking a look at the trolley housing, this is also made from aluminum, which to their knowledge is the only suitcase on the market that has that feature. And moving down to the wheel design, it does use a two-wheel design, which might be a downside for some people, or it might be a positive, depending on what you're using it for. The two-wheel design is meant for uneven surfaces. So if you're traveling throughout Europe, you're not gonna have to worry about your suitcase rolling away or just like not being able to maneuver it because it's got four wheels. Obviously it's not gonna be as great in tight spaces, but that's up to you to decide on what you wanna use it for. Now opening this bad boy up, your ears are absolutely blessed with the sound of the double TSA locks. Let me do that again for you. Inside you are met with this beautiful brown interior and at the top here you've even got this zipper compartment which holds a little amenity bag and in here it comes with a pen, freaking leather wax, your lifetime warranty card, a microfiber cloth and your manual. This is luxury bro, like even the unboxing of this thing was a luxurious experience. They've just done such a fantastic job on the design of the suitcase but overall the the experience of owning this luggage as well. Now that we have the two major packing items out the way, let's talk about the packing prep. Number one is where the fuck are you going? Are you going to Hawaii or are you coming to Vancouver? Second thing is what are you gonna be doing? Are you going for fancy dinners? Cause if you are, then you're gonna wanna bring some nice trousers, some nice shirts, or are you gonna be spending all day at the beach? Then you might only need some shirts and some nice swim trunks. Or do you plan on going and exploring the outdoors? Then you're gonna need some waterproof gear and some boots or runners. The next step is the packing formula, which I didn't come up with. I actually found it on YouTube and that is called the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 method. And you do exactly what it sounds like. You count down from five and you go into your closet, you grab as much shit as you can and you throw that into your suitcase within five seconds. I'm joking. So what you do is five tops. Now this is gonna depend on where you're going again. This might be t-shirts, this might be sweaters. Then you're gonna go with four pairs of pants. This might be shorts, this might be pants. Then you're gonna go with three pieces of footwear. Then you're gonna go with two layering items and then you're gonna go with one of each of your accessories. Okay, maybe a bit more than one because we're all stylish guys here. so we got a few accessories to go on. And when it comes to your socks and your underwear, of course, just have one for each day, so you got a fresh pair, unless you're an absolute savage, then you might be able to make it with just one. You're not a savage, bro, don't do that. And one other thing I do is I actually plan my outfits before I go, so I just throw them on the floor, create an imaginary man, and then take pictures of the outfits that I built, that when I'm on my vacation, I don't have to use my brain, because that's the whole point of vacation, to relax. Now, moving on to how the hell you're gonna get all of this into your personal and your carry-on bag. So what I do is I use packing cubes. These are going to be wonderful. It makes it so much easier to pack things into tight spaces. In terms of actually getting it into this bag, all you're gonna do is just roll your clothes up as tight as you can. Put some muscle in there because if you fold it regularly, you're not gonna be able to make anything fit. Next thing you're gonna need is some dust bags for your shoes. Obviously you don't wanna put your dirty shoes on top of your clothes, so you're gonna put it into this dust bag. But before you put it in there, you're gonna jam as much underwear and socks as you can into these shoes to get rid of that wasted space, as well as it's gonna act as a shoe tree to keep the shoe shape and it's not gonna get crushed that way. Next up, you're also going to need a toiletry bag. Now remember that because you're not bringing checked luggage and you're just bringing carry-ons, you can only have a hundred milliliters or 3.5 ounces of fluid in your bag. So what you can do is you can obviously go on Amazon and just go buy a bunch of travel sized options or you can do what I do, which is much better because you actually get to use your own items as you get these TSA approved refillable bottles and you can put your body wash, your own shampoo, your own conditioner, your own face wash in these bottles and then their TSA approved so you don't have to worry about them throwing it out. And then that way you can use your own things and you don't have to worry about affecting your hair, your skin or whatever the issue would be. And the final two cases you'll want is a travel cord case for all of your chargers to keep all of that nice and organized. And the second thing you'll want is an accessory case just to put your watches, your necklaces, your rings, your bracelets in there and make sure they're not getting thrown around together and scratched up. Now that you got all of that done, you just take it, throw it into your iconic Sterling Pacific suitcase and your duffel bag and you're gonna go to the airport looking like an absolute G, and you're gonna get through there quickly while dragging this piece of art behind you. So if you guys enjoyed today's video, I'd appreciate it if you drop a like, and if you're interested in Sterling Pacific's 5052 aluminum 35 liter cabin travel case, I'll leave a link to it in the description below. See?"

        "transcript": " There are certain items that we've all purchased where we thought, wow, that is the best money I ever spent. If only every single item that I purchased would be used or bring me as much joy as this item does. And today, I'm gonna be telling you guys about the items that I've purchased, a few of them that have been worth every single penny regardless of how much money I've spent on it. Starting with my vehicle, the Bugay M34EI. Maybe it's a BMW, maybe it's a Bugay. Some of you, this may have come to a surprise because I've never really talked about this on YouTube before, I am a massive car guy. Since I was like six or seven years old, I've been into cars. I used to bring the books to school, I'd study all the specs, I know the zero to 60 times, model numbers, the horsepower. I have been into cars for a very, very long time. My first car I ever purchased was a Hyundai Genesis. It had like 300 horsepower, which was decently fast for my first car. It was something that you could buy that was relatively quick for a reasonable price. So I got that car when I was 17, and then from 17 to 19, I drove that car, and then I downgraded to a Toyota Corolla. I hated every single minute of driving that car. But the reason I sold my Genesis and I downgraded to the Toyota Corolla was because I started investing all of my money into real estate. So from 1923, I had my money in real estate and by 23, I started doing very well financially. So I decided it was time for an upgrade. So when I turned 23, this was actually back in February. I decided to buy myself the M340i. And if you know anything about to this car and the platform, the B58 engine. It is incredible for tuning. So I've already checked about $20,000 into this car to make it look sick. I've made it faster. Holy f***ing s***. Here I've done downpipes, I've done the tune, I did carbon fiber interior, carbon fiber parts, I did lowering springs, new wheels, everything that you could think of. The car's practically done now. But dude, when I tell you that every time I get into this car, I smile, I hear the back fireman. I like instantly nut in my pants. It brings me so much joy. And I think your joy is worth every single penny. If you are in a financial position where you can afford to buy something that is going to genuinely bring you joy, 100% do it. And if you're a car guy, you'll know that it doesn't matter the depreciation or the headaches that this car brings you. You have so many memories and so much fun with the car that is 100% worth it. Life is way too short to drive boring cars, guys. So if you're into cars, you got the money, buy it. My car was 100% worth it. I can't wait for the GT3 next. Second item is one of those items that gets a lot of use. And that is my Coach 1941 Duffelbag. in this beautiful brown color wave. Would you look at that? It is literally a piece of art dog. Every time I travel or go to a hotel, I throw my clothes in there, I throw my laptop, I throw my camera in there. It's one of those items that you spend a decent amount of money on so that you can have a high quality leather good that's going to last you a long time. And every time you pull it out, you're gonna be like, damn, that's my bag. Look at how aesthetic that thing is. And I'm personally somebody who doesn't like to flash brand. So this bag was absolutely perfect. It is extremely minimalistic. As you can see, there's the tiniest little coach logo here. And that's it. Really the bags craftsmanship speaks all the words. It doesn't need the brand logo to brag. It just looks incredible. Number three, we have my only two watches that I own. My Tiso Purex, paramatic 80, 40 millimeter, and my Longines Dolce Vita. And between these two watches, this is exactly what I love about these, is that they can do different things. So it covers all of my bases. My Tiso Purex does the casual outfits, it does the semi-formal outfits, and then the Longines Dolce Vita does the semi-formal outfits, and it does the formal outfits. These are two very beautifully crafted Swiss watches with that beautiful movement at a reasonable price. And if you are a stylish guy, stylish guy like you, a watch is an absolute essential. Every guy needs a watch. And if you maintain it, you take good care of it. It is something that will last you a very long time and you can actually pass it down to the next generation. Number four, we have my Wimis projector. And yes, it is sitting in my microwave. It was just at the perfect level to project onto the wall without hitting the back of my head. And I don't use this microwave. This room is only used as a movie room and to film my YouTube videos. I have a main kitchen upstairs, so I use that microwave. This microwave has never been used since we've been in this place. But this women's projector was like 300 bucks. I don't watch TV. I watch movies once a week with my brothers. The tradition that we do. And it's incredible. For 300 bucks, I get this massive screen on the wall and I can just chill and watch a movie. There is no point in investing in a TV. This works perfectly fine. It's an incredible little gadget and I use it all the time. Now before we move into the next item, I'd like to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, Ritual. Ritual is a company that sells all types of clean traceable science-backed products. And due to the new year, they're actually doing a massive 40% off sale for your first month to encourage people to become the healthiest versions of themselves this year. And the first reason I really like Ritual is the fact that they are super transparent. Like have you ever wondered where your vitamins come from? Well, Ritual actually breaks down the nutrient sourcing as well as the environmental impact of the materials that they use in their products. There's literally no secrets at all. They show it all on their website. And I am personally taking Ritual's Essential for Men, which is not your average multi-vitamin. It is packed with 10 high quality nutrients like vitamin A, D, omega-3, and zinc. It covers all of the bases in your diet that you might miss. They also use a delayed release capsule technology, which is very easy on an empty stomach, and they put a mint tab in every single bottle. So when you open it up, you're like, damn, the smell's super good, and you actually wanna take them. But Ritual isn't only for men, they also cater to everyone. They cater to women, 50 plus, prenatal, postnatal, teens. So if your interest is snagged 40% off your first month, essential for men is usually $33. So with my code, brandonbalfour40, you actually bring that cost down to $19.80. So don't miss out on this limited time sale and let's get back to the video. Number five, we have this new comfy couch that I just bought. So since I've been here, little backstory, I've only been living in this place for seven months since my house burnt down. And I've gone through three couches already. My first couch was a different color than I expected because it looked different when it was on the screen. Second couch I got was this beautiful brown leather couch, but it was so bloody uncomfortable. It felt like I was sitting on a freaking tombstone. My brother and I ended up just sitting on the ground most of the time. And now finally I bought this couch and my God, does it make a difference when I'm sitting there watching the movie? I can actually enjoy it. And now I find myself sitting there reading a book or on my phone just chilling. So my advice to you, although the couch looks aesthetic, it's most likely gonna feel like a tombstone. So go to the store if you can. sit on the couch before you purchase it or as you may run into the same problem that I had where you're gonna have to go through three couches to find one that's comfortable. And number six is my wool items, my corduettes, my cable nits, my trousers, my sweater polos. They were all 100% worth it, guys. It makes fashion so easy. I can go into my closet with my eyes closed, throw things on. They're typically gonna fit better. They're gonna last you a lot longer. It's gonna keep you warmer. There's so many benefits to buying higher quality items that you can keep for a long time. And especially Merino wool too, because Merino wool doesn't pill nearly as easily as what I found. And then also it just feels way nicer on the skin. Wool can sometimes feel itchy and scratchy. Merino wool doesn't. Number seven is my card holder from Tom Ford in this bright blue crocodile leather. Now I find there's certain items that you want to go bright with. I don't know if any of you guys play soccer, but when I played soccer it was like your cleats. You had to go loud with your cleats. And I find that because the card holder or your wallet is something that's not seen all the time, it's only when you pull it out, you go with a statement color like this bright blue. Every single time I bring this thing out, somebody picks it up. They're like, yo, let me see that dude. I just think sick. Like, yeah, man, that's freaking Tom Ford, bro. It better be sick. Number eight, you guessed it. It's coming. The suits apply Italian cast suede loafers. Now you guys know how much I love these. I preach these all the time. They are the best value that you can get for the quality, exactly the same as the LPs, except the LPs rob your ass with an extra $1,000 on top. These were like $389 Canadian. And for some reason, they're not on the website anymore. I think maybe they just come around within only in the summertime. So when summer comes around again, guys, 100% pick these up, I got these in the tan colorway, the brown and the navy. Best loafers I've ever worn, super comfortable. And number nine is this Rothwell watch winder. Look at this thing. It's a fucking work art. This thing deserves to be right next to the Mona Lisa. Actually, you can get rid of the Mona Lisa. Throw this bad boy in the wall. It's beautiful.

        "transcript": " Since it is the end of the year, I figured I'd make a video on my favorite items that I purchased since my house burnt down back in May. Now this video was extremely difficult for me to make because since I had an opportunity to start completely from scratch, I only bought items that I actually really like. So in order to make this video short and sweet, I've chosen three of my favorite items from each category. For reference, I am six foot three, I wish. Five foot eight, 150 pounds. Starting with my pants. My first two favorite pants are these Suit Supply Wool Trousers. one in this beautiful beige colorway and one in the jet black. I have fully customized these trousers to my liking. It's like specking out your GT3. I chose everything down to the buttons, the fabric, the way that it looks, the measurements. All of it is custom tailored to myself. I'll never have to buy a pair of black pants or beige pants ever again. They look absolutely stunning. I mean, they should because they're like fucking $350, but they're absolutely amazing quality. And like I said, I'll never have to buy them again. And my last favorite pair of pants are the Cream Denim Jeans. Now these pants are very special because the cream colorway and black are one of the only two pairs of denim that can truly be dressed up Just to prove it to you on the left we have a fairly casual outfit on the right We have a very preppy looking outfit and the really nice thing about these pants is they're extremely stretchy So if you want to get into a street fight throw a little spinning kick to the head It's literally the ultimate denim to do it in moving on to my knit sweaters now This category was super difficult because you guys know how much I love my knits But in first place, recent purchase, I bought this on Black Friday, is this cable knit sweater from Ralph Lauren in the Heather Grey. It's also in an XS and man, you guys know I'm a fiend for cable knit. It's so classy. It's timeless. This is something you'll definitely see me wearing around Christmas time for sure. Next we have the suit supply mock neck made in 100% wool. This is in a small and man is this item a statement item. This is probably my most complimented item I actually have. Beautifully thin. The fit is immaculate and it will instantly dapper up any outfit you throw it under. Moving on to number three, we have the Axl Arigato quarter zip. Now this isn't a typical fit that I'd go for. It's obviously oversized, but I love that cropped and the oversized look and this specific sweater. And because it is an oversized piece, I did go with an XS. Again, it's a wool item, so it's going to keep you extremely warm. I've never had to layer on top of this. Not that I live in anywhere that's particularly super cold, but I would rather freeze to death than have to put a jacket over top of this. It's a beautiful piece. We move into our long sleeve shirt section and my favorite right off the rip is the Banana Republic Polo Marina sweater. I'm wearing it right now, check that shit out. If you guys watched my Black Friday video, I recommended this and if you bought it, you will 100% agree with me. This is the best fitting softest item to touch my skin. It is a 100% wool item too, so you're getting fantastic quality. And this is a perfect item to throw under a jacket to show some of those extra layers and the detail. and then when you want to take off your jacket, you're still gonna look like a fucking stud. Now, before we move into the next item, I wanted to say a big thank you to today's video sponsor, AG1. Now, if you're somebody who cares about looking good and feeling good, AG1 is your drink.

So if you're interested in AG1, click the link in the description below to receive a one year free supply of AG Vitamin D3 plus K2 and five AG1 travel packs with your first AG1 purchase. Second, we have the Ralph Lauren Mesh shirt. And I absolutely love the fit on this. It's very well fitted. It comes in this beautiful deep navy blue colorway and it's extremely lightweight. So this is perfect for the spring and the summertime. And this is also in an XS too. Third, we just have a plain white linen Abercrombie shirt. I absolutely love these shirts. It's a wardrobe essential. Looks great in the summertime or on holiday. and I'm wearing this one in a size small. Moving on to the jackets. My first favorite jacket, which is actually like a sweater at the same time, is this Massimo Dutti sweater vest hybrid jacket. It is a very well fitted item. This isn't something you can really wear a sweater underneath, but more so wear a T-shirt or a sweater polo. And it looks great in combination with this jacket. I love the fact that the sleeves and the back are knit, but the front has that beautiful vest material. And this isn't a size small. Second, we have my Zara Origins wool bomber. You guys know why I had to buy this back because I previously had one very similar. It was my favorite jacket of all time. The color, the clean lines, it just looks so premium. And I do want to get the sleeves hemmed because they are a bit too long for my liking. But overall, the fits on the shoulder is fantastic and the crop is excellent as well. And this is in a size small. Third, we have my North Face Nupsey jacket in a small. And this one is obviously more unique than your average North Face puffer. This one has fleece on it and I love that. It's way more unique. It's more stylish in my opinion. And I used to have a cream colorway as well, which people have asked me about before, but it's very difficult to take care of in the winter time. You have to be so careful. So I recommend getting a black one for sure if you're gonna buy it. Now moving into our short sleeve section. Our first short sleeve shirt is this Massimo Duty Cabelnut shirt. And I absolutely love this. It's in a small, unfortunately, you can't buy it anymore guys unless they decide to bring it back again. But I bought this in the summertime. It is the perfect summer shirt if you wanna go for a more classy look. So just wearing this in the evening because it can get a bit hot because it is like a sweater knit material. But it works really well too in the fall and the winter time because you can throw it under your jacket and it's going to instantly make your outfit look more classy. Moving on to the second item, we have this Abercrombie sweater polo in this Argyle pattern. Now this definitely gives off a bit of granddad vibes but also gives off a bit of I get hella poom. Super soft as typical Abercrombie quality is and it can be used as a formal piece for any gatherings in the spring, summer and the fall time. And the number three spot, Again, another Abercrombie piece is this linen camp color shirt. And just like the linen long sleeve, this is my go-to summer shirt. Throw on a little wife lover underneath and some shorts and you got a solid beach outfit. Moving down to the feet, we got a toss up between two of my favorite pairs. I've got the suit supply loafers and the axler agatos. So I put them on the same playing field, but we're just gonna start with the suit supply loafers. And I absolutely love these because they're so comfortable. They come in the calf suede. It's the exact same materials as the Laurel Piana ones, except like a quarter of the price. So if you were looking at the lower pianos, don't waste your money by these. They go with everything. And I find myself wearing the 10 ones more than any of the other colorways that I have, just because they go with more colors. Now onto the infamous Axler Gato Clean 90. Now these shoes have never let me down. They are exquisite, they're slim, they're minimalistic, they're made from top notch materials. I've worn these shoes almost daily, no matter the weather. Keep in mind I will wear these in the rain, I will wear these in the snow, and they still look like this after six months. You can always count on these shoes to finish off the outfit, no matter what the upper layers are. Because it is a white leather sneaker, the versatility is absolutely unmatched. And our final sneaker is the Reebok Classic. Now this is probably the cheapest item on this entire list, yet is one of the most comfortable shoes that I own. I find myself always wearing these. You guys know, if you watch my videos, I style these all the time. It gives off the cozy vibes. They go well with trousers. Brown and cream colorway is just beautiful. What a way to finish off the year, dude. Holy smokes. We're almost at 500,000 subscribers. It's been an absolute pleasure creating for you guys this year. Even with my house burning down, I'm still the happiest I've ever been. We have exceeded a lot of the goals for this year. I couldn't be happier guys. So I wish you so many blessings this Christmas. I hope you guys have a great new year and I'll catch you ass in 2024, boy."

        "transcript": " Hey mom, hey girlfriend. What's up brother? Or just hey subscriber who wants to buy these for the self, you selfish bastard. So today I'll be going over plenty of gifts your boy would really appreciate it, considering he's an absolute stud and he probably deserves it. I will be breaking down this video into five different categories. Our first category is going to be fashion items. Second, we're gonna have grooming items. Third, we're going to have home decor and room decor. Fourth, we're going to have the health category. And five, we're just going to have practical items. Starting with our fashion items going from cheapest to most expensive, we have the Rolllegs Datejust, I mean, Haines undershirt that you can buy in a pack of six for $17. So if you're buying this for somebody, important thing to remember is you need to size up times two when you're buying these, because they come super tight. So remember, if you are small, go to a large. Second, we have Saks underwear, some of the most comfortable underwear on the planet. We want them, we love the way they feel. It's just one of those things that we don't wanna buy for ourselves, because we're lazy, and it's like, I don't wanna spend money on underwear, but we really appreciate when we get them. Third, we have the cashmere beanie, and it is starting to get a bit cold now, so to keep our highly intelligent, sophisticated, superior brains to everybody else's cozy, we'd appreciate one of these. Number four, you can get them a nice belt. Ideally, if you want this to last them a long time, buy them a leather belt, don't buy them a pleather one. Get something in either a black or a brown colorway and keep it minimalistic like the ones that I'm showing. This is not a UFC belt. UFC! How the f***? This is something that's supposed to complement their outfit. Next, we got sweats and hoodies. The ultimate leisure wear, we always appreciate getting these because after about a year or two of watching these, they don't quite feel as cozy as they did when we first purchased it. So this is always a good option as well. Number six is a nice knitwear sweater. Now, if you want this to last this person a long time, I'd suggest looking at 100% wool or cashmere options. Ralph Lauren, Uniqlo, Everlane, and Banana Republic carry these. If you don't have the budget for 100% wool, I look at Abercrombie, Zara, and Massimo Dutti. They carry 30 to 60% wool options. Number seven is a card holder. Now this is something that should easily last this person five plus years if you buy them something decent If you're not sure on the design just go for something that is minimalistic and stick to neutral colorways One of the best places to buy high quality leather card holders is from the website essence Next you could get them a gold or silver pendant necklace Now this is an absolute necessity for every stylish guy to have so you can go look at places like Degs and South Search the Nimes or Mainside for very nice pendant necklace. FYI, I will be linking all of the items in the description below You won't need to go and search these up online. It will be underneath this video Number nine is Axel Arigato Dice Lows. Now everybody that watches my videos either owns a pair of these and it's their favorite sneaker Or they haven't bought one yet, and they really freaking want one This is the highest quality sneaker that you can get at the price point Axel Arigato's are always going to have clean design So you really can't go wrong with any of their shoes. And number 10 The most expensive in the fashion category is a Weekender bag now if this person likes to travel a lot or they go to hotels It's the perfect gift for them. They're gonna use it every single time they go there for all their clothes and their toiletries in it As for brands, I would just look at Coach. They got great quality bags for a reasonable price. Now moving into our grooming category, we're gonna start with some of the items that we don't really want to purchase for ourselves, but we need it like body wash, conditioner, and shampoo. For body wash, I recommend using native products, at least that way you know that you're putting something that's safe on your skin. As for your hair, I would say any of the Shea Moisture line is going to be perfect for you. Next, we have a natural body lotion. This is a really nice thing to have just when you get out of your shower, that you can apply it, moisturize your skin and also have a nice scent. And if you see it on our nightstand, please don't ask us any questions. Fourth are shower tools. You can get us a back brush. You can get us a body exfoliator. This just makes it easier for us to clean ourselves properly and avoid getting acne. Number five is a high quality manicure set. Something that comes with the nail clippers, the file, the scissors, the tweezers. This is a highly, highly underrated gift, but it is massively appreciated. And sixth, if your boy is starting to lose his hair, you get him a hair regrowth kit like this one from today's sponsor, Copenhagen Grooming. Copenhagen Grooming has a hair growth kit made with 100% natural ingredients. You won't find them utilizing products like Monoxyl or Finasteride. Instead, they use a all-natural alternative called Kapila Longa. It has absolutely no side effects, but it has the exact same results. In fact, if you use their hair serum, along with their moon roller, for 150 days, and you don't see any results whatsoever, they will give you a money back guarantee. And the reason they can make this guarantee is based off of all the clinical trials they've done where they've seen an improvement of hair density, a reduction in hair loss, new hair growth, and increased follicle activation. Not only do they have this kit for your scalp, they also have a beard growth kit as well. So if you have a patchy beard and you just want to grow a beard from nothing, they also have a beard growth kit too. So if you guys are interested in Copenhagen Grooming's Hair Regrowth Kit, you can use my code, BrennanBalphur, for 20% off your purchase, I will leave the link in the description below. Number seven, you can get them a trimmer if they don't already have one. If this person likes to go clean shaven like myself, I would recommend this Phillips 3000. It gives you no razor burn whatsoever and it takes about two seconds to do a full clean shave. If they do have a beard and they wanna keep it maintained, just make sure that you get them something that comes with multiple guards. Now we move into our home decor and room decor section. This is for my guys that like to have an elevated space. The first gift that you can get this person is posters around their interests. I'm personally into cars, so you come into my place, you'll see various car posters around. And this doesn't have to be expensive either. I purchased mine all from AliExpress. They're like $10 each. And then I just bought an IKEA frame for like $30 and then I framed them. Second, we have decor books. Again, utilizing the same concept, getting things that are part of their interests. I personally have fashion books. I have car books and I have watch books. Third, you could get them candles, diffusers or incense, whichever one you think that they would prefer. If you want nice smelling candles, you got the teak, you got aqua di parma, lalabo and mason margela. Fourth, we have the leather ballet tray. Now this is used for our everyday carry. We can just put it neatly onto this not leave it on our nightstand. You can find some really interesting ones like mine on AliExpress, or if you just want a square or rectangular, basic looking one, you can find those on Amazon. Fifth, you could get this person a cool rug, maybe some of those abstract shaped or just something based around their interest. Again, AliExpress is a great place to find things like this. Sixth, if this person is a big watch guy, you could buy them a watch binder or you could buy them a watch display. This is just gonna prevent their watches from getting scratched as well as keep their watches on time. Seventh is a large stand up mirror. Now this is an absolute essential for any guy that cares about his appearance It's gonna allow him to actually fully check out his entire outfit You could go for a curved one like mine which I bought from Wayfair or you could just go for the IKEA Rectangular one that one is also a great option number eight. We have the portable speaker now these designs and these portable speakers come so diverse now You can really find something that fits the aesthetic of every person's room. It really becomes like a functional decor piece It's kind of cool now moving into the health niche The first item is a glass water bottle. Now if this person drinks lots of water, but is constantly drinking it out of a plastic bottle, this is a great gift for them. It's gonna make sure that they stay a lot healthier than drinking all those microplastics. Second, we have supplements. This could be pre-workout. It could be creatine. It could be protein powder. We're gonna need to buy it anyways. We're gonna run out of it at some point, so you might as well just do it for us. Third, a gym bag. This doesn't need to be anything super special. It could just be a Nike Under Armour or Lululemon bag. Any bag will really do. Number four, if this person goes to the gym and they train legs, then you could get them a training shoe, something that is completely flat-footed so they can do their leg presses properly. Some examples of these would be like the Reebok Nano X3 training shoes, or the Nike Metcom 9 Ant training shoes. Fifth, we have the Thera gun. This is perfect for the person that's always complaining about how the fact that they're always sore and they want a massage from you, give them this gun, and then they can do it by themselves. Now, moving into the practical gifts, our first item is going to be wooden hangers. Now, if this person cares about their clothing and they're using the plastic hangers, They're most likely getting ruined. They're not supportive enough. The wooden hangers are gonna be fully supportive and they're actually going to keep the shape of their garments. Second, we have shoe trees and just like the hangers, these are meant to maintain the shape of the shoe. So if this person has a multitude amount of shoes, definitely get them some of these. Number three, we have the steamer and my God is this life changing. Going from the iron to the steamer is next level. The steamer takes half the amount of time. It's smaller so you can take a traveling with you. You ain't gonna travel with an iron. You can travel with your steamer and it's gonna give you the exact same results. Number four, we have a stylish laptop case and if this person likes to travel with their laptop, it's essential for them to have one of these anyways. So you might as well make it stylish and it's going to protect their item while looking good. And number five, again, an item that can be used for traveling is a nice dock kit, something that can throw all of their toiletries in while leaving it on the counter and having it look aesthetic and not an absolute mess. And number six is a decent looking suitcase because if you've had your parents buy you ones before, they're probably not the most stylish. So if you want a new suitcase, I'd look at brands like Lodzhell, Carl Friedrich, Rimoire, if you are absolutely falling out, that's not a necessity by any means, or a Monos suitcase. So I hope this video made it a little bit easier for you to figure out what you're going to purchase for this person, or if you just decided that you wanted to watch this video and purchase things for yourself, there you go too. You won, my friend. If you enjoyed it, please smash the like button, hit the subscribe button, and I'll catch you guys in the next one."

        "transcript": " Today, I'll be sharing with you what I believe to be are the best fashion items to be considered purchasing this Black Friday. You guys have been waiting for the clothes that I showed to be on discount right now is the time to pull the trigger. I'm gonna be leaving all of the links in the description below so you guys have easy access to go and purchase these items before they sell out. We're gonna start with Banana Republic. Banana Republic actually has a 40% off-store-wide sale right now, which is amazing because Banana Republic carries some really high-quality fabrics. They've got 100% merino wool. They've also got 100% cashmere items as well. that's really an old money aesthetic gold mine. So some items definitely worth looking at are like the Polo Merino Sweaters, regular price of $150 Canadian, now discounted to $90 Canadian, which is absolutely insane for a 100% Merino Wool Sweater. It comes in these amazing colorways, and look at the fit, man, it's absolutely perfect. If you've been waiting to buy yourself a high quality sweater polo, this is definitely the one. And we've also got the Ricardo Merino Wool Sweater, regular $150 and down to $90. Again, a wool item in the quarter zip. As you guys know, a wool quarter zip sweater is just an absolute essential in every guy's wardrobe. Next, we have this Alburo Cotton Marina sweater, regular price of $109 and discounted to 65. I just thought this one looked really interesting. I like how the collar is slightly distressed, but the rest is still nice and simple. This could be a perfect underlayer for you in the fall. Moving on to our next website, we have Everlane, which is a great store if you guys want to buy a nice high quality basics. Right now they have their t-shirts on 31% off, So the regular price comes in at $42 and is now discounted to 29. They also have a 40% off of their salvage denim jeans, regular 195, discounted to $117. So if you guys have needed some high quality denim, I definitely check these out. And then also, if you guys wanted my specific Merino wool quarter zip sweater, you guys see me wear all the time, which is $223, regular price is now discounted to 156. If you want the exact one, this is the one right here. I actually just picked up another one in the camel colorway. And the last item that caught my eye on the website was this Felton Merino cable knit crew, regular $251 discounted to 176. Remember guys, with all of these items that we just talked about, they are 100% wool. So you're gonna have the higher price tag, but it's also going to last you a lot longer. So you buy it once, you never have to buy it again. Now moving on to one of our best friends and most affordable friends, we have Abercrombie and Fitch. Starting with my first item that I think everybody should buy from them that they haven't already, which is the sweatpants and the hoodies. They are so frickin' comfortable and they fit really well too, and they're usually $75 Canadian. Now they're discounted to $56, and that goes for both the sweatpants and the hoodies, and they come in like 20 plus colorways. They got a really good selection. Now second, if you cannot afford the cable knit sweater that is 100% wool, Abercrombie also has their elevated cable stitch sweater, which is only 30% wool, but they still look very nice. It gives you the same aesthetic. I personally own three of these, and they are discounted from $124 now down to 93. Great sweaters though, you can't go wrong with one of these. Thirdly, we have the Marlton Crew Sweater, usually $99 now down to $74. I personally own this one in the brown slash gray colorway. And it's probably the softest sweater I own actually. And fourth, if you're into Varsity Jackets, Abercrombie's also got their Varsity Jackets on discount right now, usually $223, now discounted to $167. And lastly, we have the Denim jeans down from $77 to $55. You can't go wrong with Abercrombie Denim, they're always gonna be pretty good. Now moving on to Massimo Dutti. They don't have their sale on currently, but I believe by Friday they should have a sale if they don't fuck them. So some of the items that I would look out for if they're gonna go on discount, and I've actually purchased this recently, is the wool blend polo. It's currently $99 Canadian. However, it is not a 100% wool like the Banana Republic one. This one is 60%. However, it does have a slightly different design. Obviously it doesn't have the ribbed pattern. So if you like this one better, there you go. And second, we have probably one of my favorite purchases of this year, which is this knit cardigan with contrast quilted fabric. It's like a puffer vest with knit sleeves and a knit backing. Super sexy, slim fit, it looks extremely elegant, and it is $160 Canadian right now. And thirdly, I'd also look at the cream tapered denim fit jeans. You guys have seen me wear these plenty of times. You guys know how versatile they are. So if they do go on sale, currently they're $99. I would pick them up for sure. I love these pants. Moving on to our next website, we have Essence, and they have an up to 50% off sale on some of their items. Right now, my favorite shoes, the AxlRigatos, are on sale, gone from $370 Canadian, now down to $244 on almost all their colorways. It's gonna be the same price. So if you guys have been looking for a high quality white or black leather sneaker, this is the time to do it. I believe in them so much, you guys know I have four pairs. However, I do understand not everybody can afford AxlRigatos, even at the discounted price. So we also have the New Balance 550 white slash gray, discounted from $150 now down to $116. So that's also a really good option if you can't afford the axler you got to. Now if you've been looking to spoil yourself on a nice card holder, a nice wallet essence also has lots of options there as well. Some examples would be like the APC card holder for 130, usually now down to 107, or the Alexander McQueen card holder for 230, now down to 182, or the Tom Brown regular of $510 down to 291. There's so many different options on there guys. So if you're looking for a nice card holder, definitely check out Essence. Now, if you've been looking to get yourself a nice backpack to go traveling or maybe even a week-end or bag, Coach Outlet has a massive sale of 50% off, plus 25% off on particular items. Right now, they have the Hudson backpack, usually priced at $850, now down to 318. They also have their week-end or bags on sale. They have the Trekker 52, which is a regular price of $970, now down to $436. So there's lots of options there if you guys want to invest in a nice backpack or a nice weekender bag at Coach Outlet. Now moving on to sunglasses sales, we have Explicit Poets, which is my personal favorite brand. That's the sunglasses you guys always see me wearing in my videos that have that gradient where it's a little bit darker at the top and then it gets clear towards the bottom. They have a sale, buy one, get one free right now. And they're already only $60 per pair of glasses. So you're getting one for free and then you're only paying $60 for the other. It's a great deal, but if you're not into Explicit Poets and they don't fit your face, and you can also look at Sunglasses Hut. They have up to 50% off sale on lots of different brands and lots of different shapes and stuff like that. So if you're more interested in that, you've got Sunglasses Hut.

        "transcript": " This is the ultimate grooming routine for every man. Today I'll be going through everything you need to be doing, how often you need to be doing it, and what products to use to be a well-groomed, amazing spelling man. Starting with our shower routine, yes, there are people that do need this section, and yes, I'm gonna be teaching you guys how to shower properly. So when it comes to body care, there's three things that you're gonna need. A natural body wash, a back scrubber, and some sort of exfoliator. This could be a silicone exfoliator, or this could be a Lufo, whichever one you prefer. And when it comes to your body wash, I use native products. I find native products are very good. They smell nice and they're also natural. If you can't do scents, because your skin is very sensitive, I'd look at getting a cast-all soap and that's gonna be just as good. And obviously you're gonna use this soap with your tools, your back brush for your back, and then your other one is going to be used all over your body. Make sure that you're getting in between all those nooks and crannies up the Grand Canyon, between the millimeter, Peter. You wanna make sure you're doing a good job of cleaning these areas. Next for your hair, you're going to want two separate products, a conditioner and a shampoo, none of that one in 20 bullshit that you can use in your car, in your dishwasher, or in your hair. These need to be separate products. When you're using your conditioner, you can use this every single day with cold water. And when it comes to your shampoo, you don't want to use this every day. You really want to minimize your use of shampoo because it can dry out your scalp a lot and your hair. So only use it when you find that your hair is very greasy. Now after you've showered, because you exfoliated, and imagine half of you, if not more, shower with scolding hot water, you're gonna want something that's gonna bring the moisture back to your skin, because it's gonna be quite stripped and dry after the shower. So make sure that you're buying yourself a natural moisturizer that you're gonna apply every single day just after you get out of the shower. Our next category is mouth hygiene. There's three things you're gonna need, an electric toothbrush, not a manual one, some dental floss and a tongue scraper. You guys know how often to use it and how to use these, so I'm not gonna teach you guys how to do this one. Now when it comes to body grooming, there's one thing that you're gonna need and that is a trimmer. I personally use the Gillette Intimate Trimmer with a two to three millimeter guard. Now depending on how hair you get, you might need to do this more frequently than others. Some people are like a Sasquatch within two days, so you're gonna need to do it every two days. For myself, it's about every five to seven days, and there's only one area that I need to trim. It's important that you guys use the two to three millimeter guard rather than going bald eagle, because you will have a ton of irritation, and it will be super itchy. So trust me on this, I've done it plenty of times before, and I regretted it every time. Use the two to three millimeter guard. Now the next area that's gonna be trimming every week is your fingernails and your toenails. Now if you ever wanna make some money on the side, there's always a website called Footminder, but if you go Wolverine Claws, nobody's gonna buy them, are they? So I really recommend buying yourself a high quality manicure set. I bought this one from Mr. Green. It's super solid, ridiculously sharp. It will cut through any frickin' nail on the planet. I don't care if your toenail's made out of vibranium. This thing is ridiculous. Yeah! So a quick tutorial on how to cut your nails goes as follows. Step number one, wash your hands. Step number two, clean out the dirt from underneath your nail. Step number three, take your nail clipper, do one straight line across the middle and two diagonal lines to cut off the corners. Number four, you're going to take your file and you're going to file your nail going in the same direction. Don't go back and forth. Just continue in the same direction. And number five, moisturize your hands and you're done. And obviously a big part of smelling good is actually having a good fragrance, which is why today I've partnered with Scentbird. Scentbird is a fragrance subscription service that allows you to test out all those expensive designer fragrances without having to drain your full bank account on a full-size bottle, without even knowing whether or not you even like it. But with Scentbird, for only $17 a month, you'll have access to over 600 designer brands to choose from. like Carrie Brands, like Tom Ford, Perfume's Namarli, Prada, Gucci, Versace. I personally wanted to try out John Vivartos and Ragonbone Bergamot. Both fragrances I've heard really good things about. So I decided to get the tester from Centbird, which also comes with cars that break down the notes of each fragrance. John Vivartos has notes of medjool dates, coriander seeds, and leather. And Ragonbone Bergamot has notes obviously of Bergamot, petite grain, cedar, orange blossom, and cashmere wood. Both fragrances that are perfect for this time of year. Plus they come in these awesome little containers which are perfect for travel so you can bring multiple fragrances with you and you don't have to worry about them breaking. So make sure to click the link in the description below if you're interested to get 55% off your first month at Scentbird, which is actually only $8 a month. So it's a very good deal. Now let's get back to the video guys. Next, let's talk about facial grooming and we're gonna start with the eyebrows. So there's two items you're gonna need. You're gonna need a tweezer, which is typically gonna come with your manicure set and your second item you're gonna need is a facial razor. Now with your tweezers, You're just gonna go into the middle section of your eyebrows here and you're gonna remove any of that hair if you got a unibrow. And then you're gonna go around your eyebrows and just remove any of those stray hairs. Do not do too much, you will look like a crackhead hooker. Do not over pluck, please. Just go around and slightly clean things up. And with your facial razor, you're just gonna come in and you're gonna line up your eyebrows. Again, don't do too much, just slightly line things up like you would be if you were going to do a line up on your hairline. And when it comes to a cadence with this, you're gonna do this about every two weeks. Eyebrow growth is pretty slow, so you don't need to be doing this too often. Next, we're gonna move into our skincare category. And every guy is going to need an AM and a PM skincare routine. And I believe with skincare, less is more. So I'm gonna keep this very simple for you guys. Your AM routine is gonna go as follows. First step, you're gonna need a cleanser. Second step, you're going to use some sort of day serum. This could be a vitamin C serum or it could be a niacinamide serum. Step three, you're going to use your moisturizer. And step four, you're going to use a sunscreen. And you can actually get the sunscreen and a moisturizer together. so you could even reduce that to three steps if you'd like. Now for your PM routine, you're also gonna start by cleansing first, then your second step is going to be a retinol serum and a retinol serum is gonna help reduce fine lines and wrinkles and your third step is just going to be your moisturizer. Now it's important to remember that when you're buying products that you're buying them for your skin, make sure that you're reading the label and seeing what type of skin type it is because if you're buying it for somebody else's skin type, it's going to make your skin way worse. So the information will usually be right here on the bottle. Next, we move into our hair care category. Now if you wanna look good, you're gonna have to get haircuts pretty consistently. I would say that every three weeks is probably ideal for most guys. And you wanna make sure that you're going to a proper barber and not the gray clips, because gray clips will fuck your shit up. I have been there, they've literally made me bald before. Go to a proper barber, spend a little bit more money to look good. And this is not only gonna make you look better, but it's also going to be healthier for your hair because you're gonna get rid of all those split ends. And the next thing you're gonna want is some hair oils. I personally use this seven blend hair oil. Every single night I apply a little bit to my scalp and I massage it into my head. It's going to improve your scalp's health. It's going to improve your hair growth. And it's also going to give you healthier hair overall. And the final product you'll want is a leave-in conditioner. You're gonna apply this right after you get out of the shower and it's gonna help your hair stay nice and moisturized and it's going to give your hair a really nice shine. Now, I get this might seem like a lot of steps to do, but when you get into the routine of doing it, it really only takes about 10 to 15 minutes a day. And that's realistically a small price to pay. It'd be an absolute stud 24-7."

        "transcript": " Today we're going to be building a winter wardrobe scratch. I'm going to give you every single basic timeless item that you need so that you have a wardrobe that is so cohesive. You can literally go into your closet with your eyes closed, throw on random items and your outfit is still going to look nutty. Starting with our jackets. Wait, maybe we should start with our pants. Yeah, let's definitely start with our pants. Number one, you're going to need two pairs of denim jeans. I'd go for one light and one dark for your light ones. It could be a light wash denim blue if you're somebody who likes to dress fairly casually or you could go for a cream denim pair and it's going to give you the ability to dress more formally if you'd like. And whoever said no white after labor day has got to be a racist. Like that is the most racist thing you could say. No white after labor day. Fuck you. Number two, you're going to need two wool trousers that go for one light, one dark once again. I would go for a sand colorway instead of a cream because you're already going to have the cream in your denim and then I would go for a black one. These are both going to be pants that are going to elevate your outfits and it's also is going to allow you to mix and match with any color without having any clashing. And number three, if you're somebody who wants to subtly make your outfits more unique, I'd look at getting a police say pants or a corduroy pants. Now, have you know, if you're somebody who loves to dress comfortably but doesn't want to look like you're homeless, the police say pants are going to be your ideal option. The police say pants are so unbelievably comfortable. I use them as travel pants. I would say they're almost as comfortable as sweatpants are, so you get the best of both worlds. Now, moving on to our sweaters, our first sweater is the wool sweater. Now, look at getting a few of these because these are going to be a crucial layer for you in the winter time to stay warm. You could look at getting a black one, a cream one, and a brown one. And when it comes to designs, you could go for your cable knit crew, which is going to be your formal sweater, or you could just go for the plain one so that you have that versatility to wear it whenever you'd like. Next up, you'll need either two mock necks or turtle necks, which everyone you choose is gonna be dependent on how chiseled your face is. If you have the sword of Hero's jawline, said to be so sharp, you can cut yourself just by looking, ow! You're gonna suit either one. If you've got more of a rounded face, I'd look at getting mock neck. Now these are not only gonna keep your master uge neck warm, but as we've discussed before, it's a simply, fuck you, I'm better than you item. I'm better, I am better. Next, if you are a real casual guy, you'll definitely want to get yourself a basic hoodie. I would say Abercrombie probably has the best when it comes to comfortability, fit, and price. And the final sweater you'll need is the quarter zip. Now I'd say get two, once again, like most of these, try to get one in a lighter and a darker colorway. And the quarter zip is going to be the best sweater when it comes to wanting to show off the layers underneath. So if you're wearing a jacket, the quarter zip looks really nice. You can wear it as a mock neck or you can throw a mock neck underneath and have it zip down. And then you've got some serious layering action there as well. Now on to our first and most versatile jacket, the wool jacket. You guys see that? What does that kind of look similar to? That's right, baby. It's pretty much the same as my old one, kind of similar. This one has a zipper. The other one's head buttons. It's kind of like that new girlfriend. That's not quite as hot as your ex looks pretty similar, but you're satisfied because she's still hot. That's where I'm at with this jacket. Full jacket is that perfect layer for a refined look. The clean lines, the wool texture, it just makes the entire outfit look so clean. Next, you're going to need to buy yourself a down jacket for the really cold days. Now, depending on where you live, it might be more extreme or it might be more mild. If you're someone who is super extreme, I'm talking Toronto, New York, Antarctica, Greenland, where it's gonna be really cold, negative 20 degrees Celsius and below, you're gonna wanna buy yourself a really high quality jacket. I'm talking about looking at places like Canada Goose, Montclair, Rudsac, Moose Knuckles, comes at a hefty price, but it's something that's genuinely gonna keep you warm and some of them actually come with lifetime warranties. Now, if you live in a place like myself where negative eight is like the coldest it's gonna get, you can get away with just a regular puffer, you can buy it from North Face, you can buy it from Asimodoosy or Suit Supply and that will suffice. Now, the next jacket you'll want is your fun jacket. This isn't gonna be a jacket that you wear every single day, but it's gonna be the one that you bust out on that day where you're feeling super happy or you're just feeling like you wanna spice it up. This could be a varsity jacket, It could be a fleece jacket, it could be like a cool leather jacket. I'm gonna leave it up to you guys and whatever suits your style best. And our final jacket is the shearling bomber. Now the shearling bomber is just baller. Like even Bane knew this shoe was tough. The shearling jacket is defined by its furry collar. Now I definitely think that this is a statement jacket. You don't see many people wearing them, but they're so fire. You gotta get one. Now let's move down to our footwear. Now although I wear my white sneakers all year round, I do think that it is smart, depending on where you live to buy yourself a pair of boots. And if you're gonna buy a pair of boots, I would say the best looking ones, in my opinion, is the Chelsea leather boot. It's just a clean cut boot. It's not too chunky, nice and minimalistic, and it's going to style very well with most items. If you're looking to purchase any of these items, I've linked them all in the description, as well as alternatives to the items that I showed today. So I hope you enjoyed this video, and I'll catch you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Today I'm gonna be ranking about 40 men's fall fashion items from best to worst into a tier list of feelings about to get hurt today boys. But remember, it's just. My onion! All right, let's get into this list starting with the knit cardigan. Now I don't think the knit cardigan is a good idea for anyone at our age. If you are 85 and you don't know the difference between a fart and a poop, that's when you should wear this. I think it just looks a little bit too dated. So this is gonna go in the ask category, starting off the video nice and strong. Now next up we have the parka. Now I assume majority of you guys aren't going to need this unless you're living in like negative 20 degree weather. You're doing a little side quest in Antarctica. You're not gonna need this. It's not that it's a bad looking item at all. It's just not necessary for most of you guys. So this is gonna go in the meh section. Next up we have the puffer. Now this is an item that is more likely that you're going to actually need. So we're gonna put this in the you need item. It's nothing super crazy. It's not super stylish. It's just a basic item that everybody should have in their wardrobe. Up next we got the pleated trouser. Now you guys know how I feel about pleated trousers. This is gonna go straight to the God tier. This is gonna be your first God tier item for the video because the pleated trousers are gonna elevate any outfit that you wear it with. If you want to go out, if you wanna wear something nice, the pleated trousers are just gonna help really elevate that outfit. Now we got the long sleeve sweater polo. You guys already know where this one's going. This one's going straight to God tier as well. That is two in a row because any dude can actually wear and look super sexy wearing it. Specifically a black one, it's gonna hide all the imperfections, but it's also gonna give you a little bit of cleavage so you can be a little bit sly and have that sex appeal. So definitely a God tier. All right, now we have the denim jacket. Now the denim jacket is one of those items that not everybody can wear. I find that you can either look really good in it or you don't and it just looks like shit on you. So I'm gonna put that in the mess section just cause it's not as versatile as some of the other pieces we're gonna talk about today. Now, before we move on, I wanted to introduce you guys to a brand called Coats. today's sponsor. Coats is a skincare company that focuses on simplistic skincare. They believe that skincare shouldn't be confusing, it should be super easy to get into. And that's why they have created this three-step skincare routine that gives you everything that you need to prevent breakouts. Their first product is a gentle hydrating cleanser. And as the name suggests, it's gentle and it's hydrating. So if you've got sensitive skin, you don't have to worry about having strip dry or irritated skin after using it. The second step is a gentle hydrating toner which has ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides for hydration. And it's also got med-delic acid, niacinamide, vitamin C, and vitamin E to help prevent any breakouts. And the third step is the triple moisture water cream moisturizer, which is actually clinically proven to hydrate the skin all day long, help protect the skin barrier for healthy, dewy skin that never feels greasy. So if you guys are looking for a very easy, simplistic skincare routine that's not confusing, definitely check out the codes. I'm gonna leave the link in the description below. Let's get back to the video. Next, we got a puffer gelet. Now I personally love puffer gelets. I'm gonna have to put this in the would buy section because I find that when you feel that your outfit just looks kind of basic, the puffer gelet always comes in clutch. You can literally throw it over any type of sweater and it's going to give that outfit that extra touch that you're looking for. Next up, we have the wool overshirt. Now the wool overshirt's gonna go straight to God tier. This used to be my favorite item and the reason I say used to be is because I don't have one yet. Because mine, you guys remember that Zara one, that everybody raved about it was in that tan colorway that burnt in the fire. I can't find it again. Zara doesn't have it on their website, so I'm really disappointed now. Bringing that up, I'm actually gonna start crying. Next, we have the flannel. Now that's going straight to, I was gonna say ass, but I'll put it in the mess actually, because I feel like a lot of you guys still wear it. But I find that the flannel is just, it's super lazy. It's that outfit that guys throw on, and they think they look good, just because it's got a plaid pattern on it, but they put no effort into the outfit at all. [\"Pomp and Circumstance\"] Congratulations, you played yourself. Next, we got joggers. Now, I think joggers just have to be in the you need section. It's not that you would wanna wear this outside apart from to the gym. It's just one of those items that you want to have so you can lounge at home if you're watching a movie or like I said, when you're going to the gym. Next up, we have the quarter zip and that is going straight to God tier because this is probably the most elevated sweater that you can buy, the little zipper, and just the ability to show the layer underneath as you can see I'm wearing it right now. It just looks so clean, so it's gotta be a God tier item for sure. Up next we have the overcoat. Now I feel that this can be an item that a lot of people don't feel comfortable with wearing and it's mainly due to the fact that overcoats look quite long, especially if you're short. You might look like midget, like myself. So you need to get the right length. If you're getting the right length and it's slightly above your knee, it can actually look like a really nice formal coat. So I'm gonna put that in the wood buy section. And next we have the V-next sweater. Now I find this is an item that unless you're 35, plus you shouldn't be wearing this item, you might look a little bit too mature for your age. So I'm gonna put this in the mess section, not because it looks terrible, but just because this is meant for people who are a little bit older. Next up we got the workwear jacket. Now obviously this is a bit more of a rugged style, which I don't typically wear anymore, but I have purchased them in the past, and I probably would buy it again. Honestly, I think some people can definitely pull it off, So I'm gonna put it in the would buy section. And next we have just your basic button down. This is just obviously a wardrobe essential. So that's going straight to the you need section. Up next we have the turtleneck. Now the turtleneck is a difficult item. It's one of those ones unless you have a super chiseled face, it might not look the best on you. You have a bit more fat on your face. It's not really ideal just cause the neck comes up quite high. So I'm gonna put this in the mess section just cause it's really not for everyone. I would suggest the mock neck for most people. Next up we got the fleece vest. That's going straight to the ass section. Who would buy a fleece vest? It just looks like garbage. And it's not like it's done anything personally to me either because I actually liked the fleece jacket with the long sleeves, but without the sleeves, it doesn't look good and it looks super cheap too. All right, now we got the leather jacket. If I was in my fifties and I was fully bald and I was riding a Harley Davidson, I'd probably vibe with the leather jacket, but as of right now, let's go into the mess section. Next up, we got the cable knit sweater. You guys already know this is going straight to the God tier section. It's minimalistic, it's classy, it can elevate any outfit. You can wear it by itself, you can wear it under a jacket. It's too good, it's too good. Next up, we got the basic white tee. Obviously, this is just a unique item. It is a wardrobe staple. All right, and now we got the Harrington jacket. Now, for a long time, I didn't know this was called the Harrington jacket. I just thought it was a type of bomber, but it's called the Harrington jacket. The Harrington jacket sits really nicely on your waist, and it almost looks like a little bit of a crop jacket. So I think a lot of you guys would like this. I'm gonna put this in the wood by section. You should check these jackets out. Next, we have the fleece jacket. I'm gonna put this in the wood by section. The fleece jacket is quite unique. I have the North Face Nupt C 700 jacket that's got the fleece on it. And it's quite unique. Get lots of compliments with it all the time. So definitely gonna put it in the wood by section. And next, we have the mock neck. And the mock neck is exactly what I'm wearing right now. This is the one that I suggest for 99% of people. It looks better than the turtleneck. It's just not quite as high. And if you don't have as chiseled as it faces, I was explaining earlier, the mock neck works for everyone. and it's the ideal layer. It's a thin layer that you can throw underneath. Virtually anything, as you can see, I'm wearing it under a sweater right now, and it looks really good. So that's going to the God tier section. Next up, we got leather pants. Now, my boy, Jeff, one of my really good friends wears leather pants. And I'm sorry, Jeff, these are going straight to ass dog. You look like you're wearing garbage bags on your legs. Next, we have the bomber jacket. Now, if we're talking the bomber jacket with the zippers on the side, I think those are pretty dead. It's the 2014 look. Now, we got some more modern bombers, but I think the one that we're looking at here is the ones with the zippers. So I'm gonna put that in the mess section just because it's not as good looking as it used to be. And next up, we got the police say pants, and these are going to the God tier section. I get so many compliments, so many questions about where I buy them from. They have to be in this section. They're so unbelievably unique with that police say texture. It just, it claims God tier, it really does. Next, we got the sweater vest. Now, there's a particular type of person that can pull this off. 99% of you guys aren't going to be. This is like the soft boy look, so we're gonna put that in the mess section. It's an all right item, but definitely not an essential by any means. Next, we have carpenter pants. Now, I don't understand workwear at all. I don't know how this became a fashion statement to look like a tradesman. I don't get it, so I'm gonna put it in the mess section. Next, we got your basic generic hoodie. Obviously, this is just gonna go in the you need section. Everybody needs a hoodie. Next, we have cargo pants. Now, I feel the same way about cargo pants as I do about carpenter pants. This is gonna go into the mess section. Although I do think cargo pants look a bit better than carpenter pants, it's still not enough for me to say that you need to buy it or that I would personally buy them. Next up, we have the Henley. Now I feel that the Henley tries really hard to be the sweater polo, the sexy sweater polo, but it's not. It's like that younger brother that copies everything that the older brother does, but he's still not as cool. Don't worry, my younger brother doesn't watch my videos, so it's all good, I can say this. This is going to be the ass section. Next up, we got the Quilted Gillet. Now the Quilted Gillet is actually a nice item. This is something that you can wear on a more formal occasion because you can't always get away with the puffer gelat. Sometimes it's not formal enough. So the quilted gelat is gonna go into the wood by section. Now we got denim jeans. Now denim jeans are obviously just a wardrobe essential. So it's gonna go into the unique section. And then we got the long sleeve. It's another essential wardrobe staple. That's gonna go in the unique section. Next we got chinos. Now chinos are gonna go to the wood by section. I find that the chinos are gonna be the perfect medium between your pleated trouser and then your denim jeans. It's a lot more formal than the denim jeans, but not too formal. Next, we got the wool sweater, class item. That is gonna go into the wood by. This is gonna be an essential underlayer for any of the times that it's really cold outside. The wool sweater comes in real clutch. Next up, we got the quilted jacket. The quilted jacket is quite unique. I haven't purchased one yet, but I do want to purchase one. And I'm gonna put that in the wood by section, because I think these can look quite good on most people. And finally, we have the zipper cardigan. and the zipper cardigan is gonna go into the wood by section as well. Cardigan with the buttons just looks too grandad, like I've said before, the zipper just makes it look a lot more modernized. So that is it for today's tier list video. I hope you guys enjoyed this.

        "transcript": " All is finally here, which means linen shirts, linen pants, polos, and suede loafers don't work anymore. So what are you gonna wear? Well, I've got 11 items that you can wear this fall to create the old money aesthetic, starting with our most basic and most essential item, the wool trousers. Specifically pleated trousers, because pleated trousers are gonna give you the most sophisticated look and wool, because it's going to keep you the warmest and it's gonna be the most durable. When it comes to your fit, remember always keep things tailored for the old money aesthetic. Can't wear baggy pants to achieve the old money aesthetic, it doesn't work. When it comes to your colors, neutral colorways, blacks, browns, whites, navies, beiges. You guys know the drill. And also, FYI, I will be linking all the items that we talk about in today's video, as well as alternatives in the description below. Now, the second pair of pants you're gonna need are some chinos, and you're gonna stick to the same parameters as the wool trousers. Just make sure they're well-fitted, also in the neutral colors, and these are basically going to be your pants for more of your casual outfit. Now, on to the fun stuff, the sweaters. And our first sweater is the cable knit sweater. Now, the cable knit pattern on this sweater is going to be Keith to making the crew neck actually look opulent, more sophisticated. And the beautiful thing about this sweater, as I've said plenty of times before, it can be styled by itself. It looks so good with that pattern. You don't necessarily need to layer on top if you don't want to. But you can, and when you do layer on top, anything can go over top and it's gonna look really good. And also, if you wanna look like the ultimate tool, you can throw it over your shoulders and tie it in the knot. And then you can go on your daddy's yacht. And the second sweater you'll want is my beloved quarter zip sweater. Now, as much as I love my Axlori Gato ones, these are too oversized to fit the old money aesthetic. You're gonna wanna look for something more similar to the fit of this Everlane one. It's slim enough that you can put something underneath and it's also slim enough that you can throw on a jacket or whatever else you'd like to throw on top. And the third sweater you'll need, my personal favorite of all time, is the Long Sleeve Sweater Polo. Now this is a damn sexy garment. You got a few options when it comes to this. You can go for the Johnny Collar, which is the one with the big V, where you're showing off some of the cleavage. You're not so slutty, you're more reserved. You don't want people staring at your chest. You don't want to go for the one with the buttons either way each one looks good It's completely up to your style preference move it on to a plane But crucial item for layering on top of is the turtleneck slash mock neck now both of these items are going to instantly increase Suspiccation of your outfit as well as increase your ego It might be due to this subtle Exphyxiation that happens around your throat because I shit you not you will think you are that guy You're not that guy now depending on if you want to layer something on top or if you want to wear it by itself It's gonna depend on the one that you choose if you go for something less chunky that's textured This can be styled by itself and look very nice But if you go for one of the slimmer ones I would say that you'd have to layer on it just because it might look a little bit too basic now Moving on to our first top layer item is the knit over shirt now Although this is kind of a leisure looking item. It is still quite refined and it's extremely versatile This would obviously be used for a more mild to temperature day You're not gonna want to go out in the freezing cold wearing this is not gonna keep you very warm You can layer this on top of your t-shirts. You can layer it on top of your turtlenecks or your long sleeve polos, and it's gonna look great. Next, we have something kind of similar to the Overshirt, and that is the knit zipper cardigan. Now this looks far less grandad than the ones that comes with the buttons. I wouldn't suggest doing that. I would get the one with the zipper because I think it's a lot more modernized. Although this is the old money aesthetic, I want you guys to look good and look your age. I don't want you to look like 100 years old. So I'd suggest getting this one. The ribbed texture makes it look a lot more refined, and it's still something that can be layered on top of, as well as have other layers underneath if you'd like. Next up, you're going to need a proper coat. Now this coat could be an overcoat, it could be a trench coat, it could be a waistcoat. I think 99% of you guys, if you're like me, you're probably gonna like the overcoat the best and I think this is gonna work for most people. Key thing to remember when purchasing an overcoat is to make sure that you can fit multiple layers underneath, that's the purpose of the overcoat. You're supposed to be able to put two to three layers underneath it, don't have it so tight that you can only fit your short sleeve tee underneath. Keep that in mind as well as when you go to buy this, it's gonna cost you a good amount of money guys. It's not gonna be a cheap item, cause it's a lot of fabric. And if you want something that's good, you're gonna wanna go for wool. So you're gonna be looking in that $402,000 price range. Moving on to a casual later, we have the Puffer Gillet. Now it's key with the Puffer Gillet, to not go too puffy with this, because we wanna keep the proportions all the same. You're gonna wanna go for something a bit more on the flatter side. When it comes to patterns, you could go for a quilted one, you could go for a ribbed one. And the beautiful thing about the Puffer Gillet is that it can be layered on top of anything. You can go over your knit polos, you can go over your cardigans, you can go over your quarter zips. You have plenty of options when it comes to layering. It's honestly a great item. Now starting to move down a little bit, a little bit further than that. Yes, there. When it comes to your footwear, leather sneakers or suede sneakers are going to be ideal, mainly due to the fact that those types of materials are the most luxurious. You're also going to want to keep a slim minimalistic profile. We're not doing any chunky shoes. Just a nice slim one, just like Axl or Arigato's, which I always preach. They're gonna have you covered there. Unfortunately guys, your Air Force ones and your canvas vans will not do for this style. Our next shoe is a leather loafern. As the old money aesthetic is a quite formal style, you're gonna need a leather loafern. It's gonna be essential for any of the times that you guys want to go out and dress up. When it comes to the color that you choose, black or brown is going to be ideal for 99% of you. Which one you get first is gonna be dependent on what color you typically wear."

        "transcript": " This was me only three years ago. Notice everything. Notice my hair. Notice my skin. Notice my teeth. Now look at me again. You know, I just had you all cheesein' so hard. All you guys were cheesein' super hard. That was funny. All jokes aside, there's been a decent amount of change from three years ago till now. And basically today I'm just going to dive into the specifics of what I've been using that has made the biggest difference And also the tricks and tips that I've been doing as well. So let's take a look at this picture right here But one of the most apparent differences you're actually gonna see in my physical appearance is the fact that my skin looks a lot better It looks more healthy looks more glowy obviously It's a lot more clear and being a content creator especially in my niche I get sent every single product there is known to man So I've tried everything I've tried all the different tricks And there are three different things that I've noticed that have made really the biggest difference in my skin one being an exfoliant, two being serums and three being an ice roller. So speaking of the exfoliant, the one that I recommend and I always use as you guys know, is the Polish Choice BHA2% Exfoliant Liquid. Now what the exfoliant is gonna do is gonna help even out rough textured skin. It's gonna help unclog your pores. So if you constantly are suffering with breakouts or if you have rough skin and you want to smoothen it out, I definitely look at getting an exfoliant. And the second thing that has made a biggest difference in my skin is serums. Now it's gonna completely depend on what your goals are for your skin. But if you're looking for anti-aging properties, you wanna reduce any fine lines, any wrinkles, you don't wanna look old, you wanna look at a retinol serum. And now if you have goals of brightening up your skin's complexion, evening out your skin tone, you're gonna wanna look at a vitamin C serum. I personally recommend buying both of these. I actually use both, but you're gonna wanna use them at different times of the day. In the vitamin C serum, you're gonna wanna apply first thing in the morning, and the retinol, you're gonna want to apply just before you go to bed. And the third thing that I started using that has made a big difference is the ice roller. Now I'm not sure if there's actually any scientific evidence behind the ice roller and whether chirotherapy or whatever you call it actually works for your skin. But ever since I started using it for like five minutes first thing in the morning, I've obviously have noticed a decrease in inflammation in my face. It makes my face look a lot more defined. Second thing I've noticed is an improvement in blood flow and circulation. Cause once you put ice on your face, your face goes really red. Cause all that blood is coming to the surface, which might be the reason why I've actually noticed a difference in my acne. My third thing I've noticed is that your skincare just absorbs so much better. I find it's way more effective when your skin is like really cold. It just seems to apply much better and actually stick to your skin a lot better. Now the next thing that has had a massive improvement is my grooming routine. Now, you guys are funny, all right? This is not the type of grooming I'm talking about. I know this is gonna come up in the comments, it always does. Talking about grooming my hair dog. So there are two things that I've noticed that have really made the biggest difference. One, being hair oils, two, being a leave in conditioner. Now the hair oil that I use is Harold's daughter's got a strength, seven oil blends scalp and hair oil treatment. My God, is that a mouthful. And as the name suggests, it has seven essential oils in it. So all of these oils are basically just going to help promote healthy hair growth. It's gonna give your hair a nice shine. And if you have a dry scalp, this is going to be essential for you. The second product, like I said, is leave-in conditioner. Again, this is just going to be another hydrating product. It's going to help your hair look a lot healthier. And if you guys enjoy the wet look, like I always do with my hair, you can use this right after you come out of the shower when your hair is a bit damp, and it will dry like this all day. Now the next thing that I cannot deny has made the biggest difference in my overall appearance is my teeth. Now this was three years ago, and this is what my teeth look like now. And that is because I've been using Invisalign for the past three years. I say I'm using Invisalign like it's some sort of drug. Invisalign is just an invisible brace, these guys are not using heroin out here to straighten my teeth. But the money and the weight is well worth it. You cannot deny that if somebody has a nice smile, they just look sexy. It doesn't matter if they're a guy or a girl, everybody can appreciate a nice smile. is invest the money if you can afford to do it now or save up as much as you can, because I promise you this is gonna make the biggest difference in your appearance. Now the next one is the way that I smell. Now obviously if you take a look at these two pictures, the one on the right, you can clearly tell that I smell 10 times better than the one on the left. I obviously, I can't say that, I'm joking. But what I can tell you is that over the years, as my fragrance game has improved, I've gotten 10 times the amount of compliments that I did when I was younger, and the main thing that I can put you guys onto is to buy niche fragrances over designer fragrances. Now this may be the first time you've heard either of those things. So the way to put it the most simple is that niche fragrances are made by companies that only specifically make fragrances. They don't focus on anything else. Fragrances, and you've got designer companies like Chanel, Gucci, Dior, they make bags, they make clothing, they make shoes, they make fragrances as well. So you can understand why niche fragrances are gonna be more ideal because they focus on making the highest quality and most unique product. And moving on to my style, as you can see, from even a year ago, there has been a massive change from the way that I dress then to the way that I dress now. And now I've really just started focusing on dressing more formally, wearing more timeless silhouettes, more fitted. And I think this style works for 99% of guys. I think almost every guy can put this on and look 10 times better. And the reason I know that it works for other people and not just myself is because over the past year, since I've been dressing this way, I've had more DMs from guys from the ages of 13 to 35 telling me that they've gotten more compliments on their style than they ever have in their entire lives. And the reason being is just because when you wear these clothes, you look more mature, you look more elegant, You feel of a higher class almost. It's not the fact that you feel you're rich, but you're just, you know you can go out and you're dressed well, and you can go anywhere and nobody's ever gonna think you're underdressed. So guys, that is the tips that I have for you today. I hope you enjoyed this video. You found it valuable. If you enjoyed it, you'll also find that I have some videos right over here that you'll actually like as well. So you should go check those out and I'll catch you in the next video. See ya."

        "transcript": " Since my house burnt down three months ago, I've actually accumulated quite the shoe collection once again, but this time around I focused on buying shoes that I actually enjoyed wearing at the time and also focused more on build quality, higher materials so that it actually is going to last me. So let's take a look at my highly revised 2.0 shoe collection starting with Axel Arigato Clean 90 Sneaker. Now I would consider this shoe to be god tier. If you guys have watched a lot of my videos is you would see that I have literally styled this with every single outfit that I have because it's just such a versatile shoe. It's minimalistic, it's slim, it's clean, it's got a fucking bird on the side. However, the shoe is a little bit higher of a price tag. It's around the $220 Canadian range, which is not outrageous for a shoe like this. It's handcrafted, it's made with leather, it's made in Portugal. It's gonna last you a really long time. This is a much more justifiable purchase than looking at the Achilles' Load Common Projects which are like $500 USD, and you're gonna get the exact same build quality. So it's a no-brainer. Next up, we have another AXELORI GOTTA shoe, which you're gonna hear a lot about in this video, is the DICE low sneaker. And as you can see, it kind of looks similar to a Nike Dunk, however, it is 10 times better quality than a Nike Dunk. It's also got this really plush leather exterior, super comfortable. It comes in various different colorways. This, I would say, is a very unique and underrated sneaker. AXELORI GOTTA is not a very well-known brand, but they have high quality shoes, which is why I've been purchasing so many of them. And that brings us to our third axillary gots of sneaker. I promise you it's the last one. And this is the clean 90 in black. It's exactly the same as the first one we talked about, the white one, except this one's in black. And I just bought this one because I needed a black shoe. All of my shoes are white. So I needed one that I could wear in the winter time, in the fall time, and I'll have to worry about them getting instantly destroyed as soon as I walk out the door. Moving on, we have the Reebok Classic. And this is a highly, highly underrated sneaker. I feel this is even on the radar for most people. A lot of people know about the Club C, They don't actually know about the Reebok Classic. And only for $110, you get a shoe that looks this freaking good, not to mention that it comes in probably a hundred different colorways. So there's literally a colorway out there for everyone. Next up, we have the Nike Air Max 97s. This is a come to Garcon collab. Now I've never been a huge chunky shoe fan, but when I threw these on, I was like, yo, these go super hard. And apparently this is called a Glacier Gray colorway. It honestly looks a little bit more blue in person. Still looks really nice. And I also wear these to the gym quite a lot. It's become my dedicated gym shoe, apart from the days that I train like. Moving on to the most absurdly priced shoe I have in my shoe collection is the Brunello Cucinelli Tennis Shoes. These were $1,200 USD. I did not pay for these shoes. I got a gifted to me in part of a collaboration I did with Harry Rosen, so that explains why I have such an expensive shoe. But as you can see, it looks very similar to the Axel or I got to a Dice Low. However, instead of it just being a fully leather shoe, it does have a bit of suede on it. And it's Brunello Cucinelli, which gives it the ridiculous $1,200 price tag. Next up, we have the OG New Balance 550s white slash gray. Now these shoes are my everyday beater shoes. They are so freaking tough. I've had these for three months and I've worn them quite a bit and I still don't see a fine wrinkle on the toe box, which is absolutely nuts. Moving on, we got the most affordable shoe in my shoe collection, which is the Converse Chuck Tailors. Now this sneaker has a very special spot in my heart because it was the first shoe that I had actually bought to start my YouTube channel. If you guys remember the Yerbaugh Brandon channel, I had the CDG version of this. I'm much more boring now, so I decided to erase off that heart and just go with the originals. And these are my dedicated leg day shoe. Onto some of my more formal shoes, we have the Suit Supply Italian Calf Swade Lofors. And I had to buy these in three different colorways, the dark brown, the light brown, and the navy, because I fucking love these shoes so much. And it's crazy, because I wear these more frequently than I wear in my sneakers, which is nuts. Cause if you told me that three years ago, Brandon, you're gonna be wearing suede loafers. I would have told you to go lick trees, because there's no shot I would've been wearing suede loafers with my style back then. But now that I dress a lot more formally, more mature, this really helps me elevate my style, gives me a more preppy look, not to mention they are ridiculously comfortable. Like I said, they're made with Italian calf suede. And the suit supply ones are $387 Canadian versus Laura Piana's version, which is $1400. Next, we have the Nike Zoomfly Runners. Now these shoes are obviously super bright. And I figure just like soccer cleats, you gotta have shoes that are brighter than everybody's future. They need to know when I'm ripping past them. That's Brandon Balfour, because he's got ridiculously bright shoes. They are super comfortable. As you can see, it's got this ginormous two inch sole. So when you're running on them, it literally feels like you're running on clouds. You're not gonna have any knee pains or shin pains. And that was the main reason I bought these shoes, just because they're so comfortable to run in. And finally, we have my beloved Birkenstocks and Dog. I do not care what you think about them, because if you're wearing flip flops or wearing sneakers to the beach, you look more stupid than I do. I think Birkenstocks are going to be your best option when it comes to open toe shoes. when you go into the beach. It looks really good styled with linen pants and a linen shirt. I honestly think it's your best option guys. So that is my current shoe collection. I will obviously be purchasing some more leather shoes as we move into the fall and winter season, which I'll keep you guys updated on. But apart from that, I hope you guys enjoy today's video and I'll catch you in the next one. See you."

        "transcript": " Sooner or later, it's gonna look like this. And you don't wanna be outside dressed like this. And that is why today we're gonna be specifically talking about the false-flash winter items that sell out the quickest. Because if you're not buying it right now, it's gonna be too late, my boy. The highly intelligent people are buying their stuff right now because they get the best deals right now, and they also have the most amount of choice. And one of the fastest items to sell out right now is the cable knit crew sweaters. And for good reason, it is one of the few formal crew necks that just looks absolutely stunning by itself. But if you want to take it to the next level, throw on one of your jackets, and because of that cable knit texture, you just got something that looks absolutely incredible. But that's not the only sweater you're gonna need. You're also going to need a plain crew neck, so you have versatility for your casual situations. When it comes to your fabrics, you can go with wool. That's going to be your warmest fabric, or you could go for a Buclain knit if you want some interesting texture, or you could obviously go for your plain cotton one, but that's no fun. Don't go for that one. And next up, we have my favorite sweater of all the wool quarter zip sweater, defined by its ability to let your chest hair see the sunlight. The quarter zip is quite a posh sweater, although it is extremely versatile. Jeans work extremely well with the quarter zip, as well as a pair of well-tailored trousers. And it's also one of the few garments that allows you to show that layer that's underneath. Moving on to the Johnny Collar Knit Sweater. If you just want a light layer that can be worn on its own, this is best. It gives you the same collar as a sweater polo, but also comes with longer sleeves. It's typically fitted, so if you've been hitting the gym, you're gonna be able to show off some of the gains. Yeah, buddy! Next, we have the turtleneck slash mock neck. And there's two different ways you could go, depending on if you want it to be a stand-alone item or a layering item. You could go with a nice thick, chunky-nick turtleneck. If you want it to be your stand-alone, or you could go with a nice thin one that can be easily layered on top with a jacket, a vest, or a blazer. If you're only going to buy one, I would suggest that you buy the thin one so that you have more versatility. Next, let's talk about pants, because pants sizes seem to disappear extremely quickly. So what you'll mainly wanna be looking at right now are wool trousers. Well, trousers are going to be your warmest option. Style-wise, it's completely up to your personal preference. You can go for baggy, you can go for slim fit. It's completely up to you. I personally, I'm always gonna go for tailored fit or slim fit, just cause I think that looks best for most guys. Next, we have sweatpants, particularly the ones from Abercrombie, the essential joggers, mainly due to the fact that they have good fit. They're also extremely soft. By no means are you ever gonna see me wear this outside of the house, but this is just an essential for the winter time and the fall time if you wanna dress cozy in the house or if you wanna wear them to the gym. You also cannot forget about jeans. You're gonna need a cream pair, a black pair, and a bleached blue pair. Fit-wise, slim or tapered fit is always gonna look best, like I said previously with the trousers, but if you're into street style, by all means go for a looser fit. Moving on to our jackets, you will need a vest. Your vest is going to be an essential layer for you in the fall. It's going to elevate each one of those sweaters that we had previously talked about. If you're into streetwear or more casual looks, I'd suggest going with a really puffy nylon jacket, is I think that's going to suit your style the best. If you're like me and you like a little bit more classy I would go for something around the medium to flat range in puffiness But if you want to be even more classy you can switch that out for something made from natural fibers like cotton rather than going for a nylon jacket Now the next jacket you'll need is a wool bomber. This is going to be your elegant jacket It looks super sleek and it's a fantastic layering item You can go for one with buttons or you could go with one with the zipper I think the most important part is just making sure that your jacket fits you properly that it lands right at mid-fly any longer than that and I just don't think it's gonna look that great. Moving on to a jacket which I'll always love wearing is the Varsity jacket. When it comes to a varsity jacket I feel you have to go bold. You don't go with a neutral color with a varsity jacket. You go for a blue, a green, a burgundy. The varsity jacket is supposed to be a fun statement jacket and if I was going to buy one right now I'd be looking at places like Zara or Avricombie for good choices. And now our last jacket is the Puffer jacket of course and you have to go puffy with the Puffer jacket. It's literally called the puffer jacket for a reason. And I personally went and bought the North Face Nupsey 700 jacket because I think they're iconic. They're gonna keep you super warm and you're gonna get a little bit of street cred. And moving on to our footwear section, sneakers are going to be an essential. I'll personally be sticking to brown and beige and navy sneakers as it tends to be my color palette in the winter on sneakers that I've majorly fallen and in love with and I think is massively underrated is the Reebok classic leather. It comes in so many different colors and it literally is not worn by every single dude out there. So guys, I hope you enjoyed today's video. I have other videos very similar to this one right here in this left hand corner. So if you're interested, go check this out and I'll see you guys in the next video."

        "transcript": " We are going to build an entire summer wardrobe from scratch. I'm going to help you guys build something that stands the test of time, but also stands the blazing hot heat. By the way, now making that statement has got me thinking, if only my entire wardrobe were summer essentials, maybe it would have survived. I digress before I start crying. So let's start building this timeless summer wardrobe with the easiest item to wear which is the undershirt slash tank top Now there are two styles that you should get the Haines be at your white starter pack and the Abercrombie Potentially see your nib tank the Haines is going to be your perfect undershirt from when you're wearing a camp collar shirt You're wearing your linen shirt. It's thin. It's lightweight FYI You will need to size up times three or as you're gonna end up amputating your body Because these boys come tight and the second one the Abercrombie tank This is just going to be perfect when you just want to wear a tank alone. It's somewhat presentable You're not gonna look like a complete douchebag moving on to our next basic We have the everyday t-shirt so go to unique little buy one in every single neutral colorway And you're pretty much done style wise and fit wise It doesn't matter if you like oversized or if you like slim fit just buy whichever one you like moving on to an item that if it Would be called action it would be called sex Because you look like a sexy other When you're wearing this thing and that is the linen shirt I have yet to see a guy that can't wear a linen shirt Every guy can put on a linen shirt and look 10 times better. Trust me, you're gonna have more phone numbers than you ever have in your entire life. Now, we have the linen shirts, little brother, which is the Camp Collar Short Sleeve shirt. And depending on the material you guys choose, you can get different looks. Of course, you got your linen one, which I suggest should be your first one that you buy. The next one could be a polyester one, and this one gives you a really flowy and wavy look. And then you've got the cotton knit one, like the one that I'm wearing right now. This one is just perfect all around because of that texture. It just looks so freaking good. Next up, we really have an add-on to the count color shirt because essentially it's the same thing and that is the bowling shirt. And this is not an essential by any means, but it's fun. It's unique, it's vintage. Provocative. It's nice. It's the people going. It just looks cool. So if you wanna be a little bit more fun, you can throw one of these into your list. Moving on to my beloved sweater polo. Literally get one that's ribbed, get one that's patterned, get one that's crocheted in it. Get whatever one your heart desires because sweater polos always look good. You could not go wrong with a sweater polo. Next we have an interesting one that not a lot of people know about and that is a long sleeve polo that is made from linen. Now, this is something that I've only recently found and I bought it from Abercrombie. I'm sure there's other places you can buy it from so if you know, drop it in the comment section below. But this is your very classy, more elegant shirt that you can wear on a nice summer evening or on a hot spring day. Now, moving on to the lower half of your body, you have linen pants and these are just gonna go so well with any of those items that we just mentioned and if you're like me and you absolutely hate shorts, the linen pants are gonna be an absolute essential for you. Buy one that's black, buy one in white, buy one in beige, and I suggest that you get one that comes with side adjusters so that you have one that is formal, that you can dress up, and then one with a drawstring so you can wear that one to the beat. Oh, as much as I don't like shorts, there are some days where it's absolutely necessary, so you're gonna need a few pairs of shorts. I would suggest you get a linen one, of course, because that's what we've been talking about the whole time. It's gonna look great with all of those other items that we've mentioned. You also could get sweat shorts if that's your jam, or you could go for a cotton one, like these white ones, that would look a little bit more formal, so you can wear these to a brunch or a dinner. And of course you need some board shorts. So if you decide you want to just send a back flip into the ocean, you can do so. And you're not gonna look stupid like you would if you did that in your sweatshorts. Next up, we have the summer footwear section. And of course you'll need some white leather sneakers. But listen to me when I say this guys, buy something that is actually high quality. I'm not talking Air Force Ones or New Balance 550s. I'm saying buy yourself a pair of axillary gatos, all of your cabels, or common projects that you're really balling out. You're gonna go through so many pairs of the Air Force Ones that's gonna end up being way more than a few hundred dollars for a white leather sneaker that's gonna last you years. So please, for your own sake, buy some of this high quality is something I wish I knew from the beginning. Now, you're gonna also need some formal summer footwear because you can't always wear sneakers all the time. And I think the perfect shoe for this would be the Suede Lofer. Now, Suede Lofer is gonna instantly make your outfit look more elevated. It's gonna make you look more affluent. It's gonna make you look more sophisticated. You don't have to buy yours from Lower Piana FYI. You don't need to spend thousands of dollars to get these shoes. I bought mine from Suede Supply. It's made with Italian calf suede and mine were just under $400 Canadian. I understand that it might be expensive for some, which is why I also bought one from Massimo Dutti in this light gray colorway. It was $169 Canadian, so it shares the exact same look. Not quite made with the same materials, but it still looks good. So if you guys want a cheaper option, there you go. But the suits and plaid ones are the ones that I wear on a daily basis. Next, of course, you got your open-toe footwear. Your sandals, which seems like a lot of you guys don't like. But in reality, it looks a lot more ridiculous when you're wearing your Air Force 1's in the sand bro. You got plenty of options when it comes to sandals, Birkenstocks, leather sandals, slides, the world is your oyster, just avoid flip flops if you don't wanna look like your dad. And moving on to our accessories, we have summer jewelry. And when I would say it classifies as summer jewelry, it's just things that reminds you of the summer, things that remind you of the ocean. That would be something like a pearl necklace. Maybe you're not into pearl necklaces, you think it's too feminine. You could go for an anchor. Obviously an anchor would remind you of boats or turquoise jewelry, which is blue, that reminds you of the ocean, you guys get the idea. Things of that nature. Next, we have sunglasses, and of course you're going to need a black pair. This is gonna be your most versatile pair. Your next one could be a turtoise shell one. If you wanna look like a smart ass, I like to wear these ones a lot. Or you could go for a clear frame one, which I think will look really cool in the summertime. Lastly, you will need a good summer fragrance. You want something that's fresh, something that's light, maybe contains a bit of citrus. Some good examples of a good summer fragrance would be like Dolce and Gabbana light blue, Nautical Blue, Aqua de Geo Profondo, Paparoban Invictus, and Tom Ford Costa Azura.

        "transcript": " The world of jewelry is quite vast. You've got designs of skulls, eyeballs, choker, spike chains, middle fingers, and yes, those too. You must be thinking all of those options sound absolutely terrible, and they do. But that is why today I'm going to teach you guys how to carefully curate an entire jewelry collection from scratch so not only can you elevate your outfits, but you'll have a collection that you'll never need to upgrade again unless you break it, of course. But before we get building, there's four things that need to be said. Number one, simplicity is key when it comes to building your jewelry collection. Number two, when it comes to pendant necklaces, anything that is bigger than a quarter is too big unless it's a rectangle. Number three, your metal choice, whether you choose gold or silver, it's completely up to you and your personal preference, it doesn't matter. And number four, do not go cheap on your jewelry. Make sure that you invest in high quality ones at the beginning, because trust me, the cheap ones will break on you or they're gonna turn your neck green, both of those things you don't want. So our first and least frightening also makes the biggest difference is the pendant necklace. And in order to have a good necklace collection, I'd say that you need at least four. So for your first pendant necklace, I would recommend going for the bar pendant necklace. It's more discreet, so if you're not used to wearing a necklace yet, this is the perfect one to start with. It's not an attention grabber, but it's definitely going to elevate your outfit. Now, the next one I'd recommend you get is any of the following shapes, either a circular one, a square one, or a rectangular one. Notice how the ones that I'm showing are not massive. They're nice and small. They're not Olympic medallion size, just simplistic and well-sized pendants so that it's timeless. Next, you do need to have a bit of fun, So I'd say you need at least one statement necklace. You could go with something that is two tone like this one, maybe a pearl necklace if you're into that, or you could go for something that has a pop of color like this green one to show that you pay attention to the detail in your outfits. And our final necklace isn't a pendant necklace, it's just a chain so that you can create some nice layering with your pendant necklaces. Just like an outfit, the more layers that you have, the better it's going to look. So in order to achieve this layered look, all you need to do is have a shorter chain by about two inches. So if your pendant necklace is 21 inches, and you'd buy a chain that's 19, and that's going to give you that layered look that you're looking for. Now moving on to rings, I would say that the ideal collection consists of six rings and obviously you're not gonna wear six rings at the same time. This is just so that you have a good selection. So starting with our most basic ring, you have the plain ring, and you want two of these. You'll want to look for a ring that has no particular design other than the actual shape of the ring. I'm talking slightly oval, squared, or rectangular, and the reason you want them to be plain is because these will act as your base, kind of like your black pair of pants would be in your outfit. You're gonna make your outfit look more interesting by adding some other items like our intricate ring. And you want two of these intricate rings. And an example of an intricate design would be something like this Cuban link ring where you can actually see the craftsmanship that went into this ring. Or even this Piper Puff link pinky ring, just incorporating one of these with your basic ring and you've already got something that's pretty cool. But if you wanna take it even further, then you can get yourself two statement rings. And just like our necklaces, a statement ring could be something with a crazy design like this dove ring, or again, it could be something like a pop of color, like this beautiful blue ring with the praying hands. Now, some of you are probably thinking, well, okay, thank you, I've got six rings that I can wear now, but how do I actually style these rings? Well, to answer that question, I'd say that the easiest way is to go with two simplistic rings or intricate rings on one hand and one statement ring on the other, mainly due to the fact that statement ring doesn't really need any other rings around it to make it more interesting. It's already pretty out there. But of course this completely depends on how classy you are dressing up. If you're wearing a watch for instance, you don't wanna necessarily be wearing three rings. You might just want to wear two simplistic rings on one hand or maybe even just one statement ring on the other hand and that's absolutely it. You're gonna have to decide based on your own judgment and what your outfit looks like. Now next up we have the bracelet. And there's only really two bracelets that you need to get. You want to buy yourself a cuff bracelet and you'll want to buy yourself a chain link bracelet. And these two are going to play different roles depending on the occasion. Now your cuff bracelet is going to be your formal event jewelry. This is something that you could maybe pair with your watch if you have one or it could even be a replacement for your watch. If you don't own one, this is going to go with your suit and tie events or just when you're dressing semi-formal. And then the chain link on the other hand is through the complete opposite scenarios. It's meant for your casual events when you're just going out, you're wearing your basic outfit. That's going to help you elevate your outfit. And finally, I wanted to add in watches because I feel like it'd be kind of weird to have a jewelry collection without watches being mentioned. So, watch is definitely important. I would say that you need to. I personally only have two watches and I'm able to cover all of my different scenarios. The two different watches that you'll need is one dress watch and one casual watch. Your dress watch is going to be something that is very simplistic. It doesn't have a ton of design. It typically comes with a leather strap or an alligator strap. It can come with a metal strap as well, but I find if you're only going to have two watches, I've got one that has a leather strap. And now for your casual one, you can do quite the complete opposite. You can have ones with very intricate designs, maybe like a diver's watch, a field watch, a G-Shock, whatever you guys like. That could be your casual watch, but you need at least two, and that should cover all of your bases. Now, where do I buy my jewelry? Any of my simplistic jewelry I've bought from MainSci, I found that they have fantastic quality. Their designs are absolutely timeless. I have lots of love for MainSci. I've also got Surgeons & Ions, which is where I buy a lot of my statement rings, because I've got a massive selection of really unique designs. And then also when it comes to my necklaces, any of the unique, like the pearl necklaces or some of those gold ones you guys saw, those all came from Dex and Sal. And Dex and Sal has an awesome selection for necklaces. You've also got brands like Crafted London, Vitaly, Thomas Sabo, Majuri, and Clocks and Colors. There's lots of other places you guys can look, but those three were the ones that I've tried and I've liked the best. So everything in today's video will be linked in the description below. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and good luck on building your jewelry collection."

        "transcript": " The old money aesthetic. Well known for its understated sophistication and elegance, timeless designs, well-tailored silhouettes, and high-end fabrics. It calls you broke low-key in nine different languages. Paola, Hotong, Unira, Caccia, Dulkaya, Pasa, Rota, Capo Tricada, Oaleta. However, you don't need billions of dollars to achieve this look. At the end of the day, it's about making the right choices when purchasing your clothes, and there's four ground rules that you need to follow if you want to achieve this aesthetic. Firstly, forget about any large logos. Forget about graphic tees, forget about varsity jackets. We're going for understatedness. Second, stick to a neutral color palette. Use the hues of browns, beiges, blacks, charcoal, whites, navies, and khakis. Number three, fit is absolutely everything. Skinny-ass jeans and baggy pants you could jump out of an airplane with do not exist in this realm. Everything must be fitted and must be well-tailored. And number four is to stick to the higher-quality fabrics. These fabrics will like linen, wool, leather, cashmere, and cotton. Now, let's actually start building your wardrobe. Firstly, you're gonna need an array of pants, specifically suit pants and trousers. You wanna look for ones with buttons, pleats, or side adjusters as these look the most classy. And that's for how many colors you should get guys, buy as many as you can possibly afford. As I've said before, pants make the biggest difference in your outfit. And when it's time for your more casual situation, you can always go for a well-tailored chino. I will be linking lots of different options for price ranges and budgets in the description below. Next, you'll need some elegant polos. Once again, keeping it neutral and fitted. And as you can see here, I have this Abercrombie one. It's simple. It's got this classic Argyle pattern. I've got this Massimo Duty one that has a rib textured as well as this other one from Massimo Duty that has a cable knit design, all very classy looking polos. And one thing to note is that texture is completely fine to play around with. It actually adds some elegance to the polo so don't feel afraid to play with textures. Just avoid anything with big logos. Next, we have fitted t-shirts and obviously you've got lots of options. When it comes to this, You could go for one with a cable knit design like this one from Massimo Duty, which I think exudes elegance. It's called that beautiful texture. You could also go for a thicker t-shirt that has more of a sweater-like material for a more premium look. Next, you'll need some button-ups and some button-downs. Linen, linen, length. You need some linen shirts for the summertime, guys. Obviously, if you're just gonna buy one, go for a white one. And as for fit, go for a regular fit or a slim fit, depending on your body type. Also, you'll want some striped button ups or button downs. They're typically going to be white with navy. Those are the ones that look the best. And then you'll also need a few Oxford shirts as well for your really formal occasions. Next, you'll need some sweaters. And I say sweaters guys because hoodies don't exist in the old money aesthetic. Sorry hoodie lovers. The sweater is going to be your ultimate layering item. This is where you want to choose higher quality fabrics like wool or cashmere. Don't go cheap on this area. Look at cable knit, cruise sweaters like this one from Abercombe or Ralph Lauren. also thin sweaters like the cashmere one to put a dress shirt under. And we cannot forget about the classic quarter zip sweater like this one from Everlane. Absolute essential for the winter time and the fall time if you're trying to achieve this old money aesthetic. Now onto your coats. And I haven't replaced mine yet since the fire. So we're gonna use Alex as an example. You wanna wear something that is tailored and structured like what you're seeing him wear. And when it comes to buying one, you want to buy a wool one. And it's actually relatively easy to find one on a budget. You can go to the thrift store. I see them there all the time. You can buy one for 50 bucks and take it to your tailor and make it look absolutely perfect. Next, you'll need the Holy Grail of elegance, the suit. Every guy needs a suit and their arsenal. Picture yourself in a well-tailored black navy or gray suit pulling up into a room. Ladies just throwing themselves at you because you're so freaking sexy. Well, that's what I like to think would happen. But assuming most of you guys are on a budget and you can't afford a Tom Ford suit, I would go look in suit, supply suit, supply has lots of options when it comes to nice tailored items and also higher quality fabrics. As for footwear, consider a classic leather penny loafer or an Oxford for more formal occasions in both black and brown. Second, you'll need a loafer sneaker as it provides classy yet convenient option for the casual outing. Thirdly, don't forget to get yourself a pair of Birkenstock so you can wear those to the beach without socks, of course. And if you prefer sneakers, make sure that you opt for a slim white leather sneaker. Don't go for an Air Force One or a New Balance 550. Those are far too chunky. Now for the finishing touches, accessories. Firstly, you'll have to get yourself a watch. And if you want to go for a true old money aesthetic, you want to go for something with a leather band and a small face. Think Cartier Tank style. And I assume majority of you guys can't afford a Cartier Tank. So there's lots of other options that share the exact same style, like the Longines Dolce Vida, the Oris Rectangular, the Seiko Sub 880, and the Hamilton Bolton, all at different price ranges. Now let's talk about belts. You'll need two belts, a black and a brown one that's gonna cover all of your different occasions. Remember to keep the buckles sleek and minimalistic. This isn't a UFC championship belt that you're trying to wear. It's supposed to be something that just complements your outfit. And last but not least, eyewear so you can protect your eyes from the dazzling wealth. The Ray-Ban Clubmaster, Erica's, Wayfarer's, Tortois, Shell Frames, Aviators, or Round Glasses are ideal. Just make sure that you're avoiding any of the new trendy designs like the Proto ones, the really thick chunky ones. You don't want any of those guys. Now, achieving the old money aesthetic isn't just about dressing well. It's about the entire package. You have to have good skin, good hair, a good body. And that's why you should subscribe if you haven't already, because I'm gonna be doing plenty of videos on how to take care of those things."

        "transcript": " I remember it like it was yesterday. Tar is still very fresh and the damage now visible in daylight. It was May 14, 2023. It was actually Mother's Day. My house that I lived in for 22 years had completely burned down. Shock and devastation as one family watches their home burn. All of the things which you guys have seen in my YouTube videos, fragrances, clothes, equipment, furniture, it was all gone within a matter of minutes. It's times like these that can either make or break a person, but you have a choice to decide which angle you choose to look at it from. You can choose the story of woe is me, my house burnt down, all of the things that I've worked hard for or gone. How am I ever supposed to recover? Or you could choose the story that God has given me a chance for a fresh start. He saved my family, my family and I, and my community are closer than ever. And he's taught me a bunch of beautiful lessons along the way. Which story do you guys think I told myself? Damn, that was intense. What do you guys think? That was like a Netflix documentary style. Damn, it feels good to be back. You guys know which side of the story I told myself. I'm Brandon Powell. Come on, I've been working on my mindset for a long time guys. As long as my family is okay, I'm not attached to my personal items, so it doesn't matter. But that's besides the point. What I'm here to talk to you guys about today is what I've been buying to rebuild my wardrobe from scratch. I literally started from absolutely nothing but a pair of linen pants. So up until this point, this is what I've been purchasing. So first off, we got our pants. And I went ham on these. I went and bought eight pairs of pants. And as you guys know, I've told you before, pants are the most important part of your outfit because it can change the upper layers so drastically depending on the pants that you choose. So the first pair of pants I had to buy back was my beloved River Island Plice pants with that beautiful texture, that amazing flowage. My favorite pair of pants, I'm so happy to have them back. Next, I went and purchased two pairs of pants from Abercombe, these linen pull-on tabbed pants, which look absolutely amazing. They're perfect for the beach, beautiful, lightweight pants. And then I bought these navy suit trousers, and my God, are these things comfortable? They feel like leggings for men. They're so, so nice on the skin. Of course they don't fit like leggings. They fit very nicely, but they feel so, so nice on the skin. Next I went onto my absolute favorite website for pants and old money styles, Massimo Dutti, and I went absolutely ham. I bought two pairs of these ice thread cotton dyed slim fit chinos, one in the light gray and one in the beige. Look at the fit of these, they're absolutely beautiful. Keep in mind, I do get my things hemmed, so the length was a little bit off, but apart from that, the actual fit of the pants is gonna be exactly the way that you're going to receive it. Next, I bought these tapered fit canvas trousers with darts, perfect lightweight trouser. It's got the pleats. It's a very elegant looking trouser and it comes in this beautiful charcoal colorway. After that, I purchased these cream tapered fit denim jeans. These are a very, very nice stretchy material. They're not uncomfortable to wear and then again, the fit is absolutely perfect. And lastly, I purchased these black linen trousers that come with the side adjusters on it, which I've wanted for a really long time. It's just perfect for a dapper occasion on a hot day. And speaking of a hot summer day, you'll also need a good fragrance to wear on that hot day, which is why today I want to say a big thank you to our sponsor, Scentbird.

It's only about $8 for your first month, so very accessible. Let's get back to the video. Next, because it is summertime, I had to purchase some undershirts. I bought these ones from Marshalls for $20. As you guys know, they are the ultimate layering machine. Then, I had to buy two button-ups, this linen one from Abercombe. It's an absolute perfect length. I typically find that it's very difficult to find because most of the time they're a bit too long. And the second one is this striped button-up from Club Monaco. Once again, not too long, great fit, and just the wardrobe essential. And next, I bought three of what I'm most well known for, sweater polos. I got this Argyle textile one that looks kind of like something your grandfather that used to get ladies back in the day would wear, but a modernized version, as well as this green one with a similar design, definitely not as versatile as the other one, but more fun for the summer, as well as this sweater through polo in the blue with some floral designs and some images of Santorini grease. All three of these are from Aberconvy. Now, because it's not always hot here in Vancouver in the summertime, it does get cold sometimes in the mornings, I bought two hoodies from Abercombe. They are oversized, so I actually sized down on them so I can achieve more of a cropped look. But by far, these are the best hoodies that I found in that $70 price range. Now, I also bought my favorite knit sweater, which is the Buclay Knit Sweater from KOS. Just a gorgeous knit, super comfortable and soft on the skin. And the fit is a bit on the relaxed side, which gives it that perfect, cozy look. Also, while I was on the website, I couldn't help myself, but by a wool jacket, has this beautiful two zipper design, very well structured, and the stitching is on point. Now we got the sneaker section, and my first sneaker I had to purchase back was the New Balance 550s. I just love how durable these shoes are. They're the everyday beaters. I had them for two years, and they didn't even have a single crease mark on it, so I was like, I gotta buy back the New Balance 550s, so I just got the white and gray one. And the next sneakers I bought were from the brand Axl Arigato. These are the Dice Low. I got one in the green colorway in the blue because in the summer I like to wear those colors. And Axel Arigato is a sustainable company. They use really high quality materials and then they're also quite unique because you won't see everybody wearing them. They're kind of like the replacement for dunks or the new balance like UNC colorway for example. And this other Axel Arigato is the Clean 90 White Sneaker, an elegant white sneaker. You just need one of these in your wardrobe for the more dapper occasions. when you want to go for a cleaner look, these are the sneaker to go for. And I also received these Reebok classics, and I say received because Reebok was kind enough to send this to me after the fire, but this is such a beautiful colorway. I love the browns, the creams, it just adds so nicely to the sneaker, and it's also got that cool, cozy texture to it, which is awesome. And finally, I got a pair of black Converse Chuck Tailors, just because I don't have any black shoes, and I wanted to have something to wear to the gym for leg day, the Converse Shook Tailors are the ideal shoe for that. So guys, that is what I've accumulated so far. Like I said, I still have a ton to get. There is an enormous amount that I still need to replace, but that is what I've gotten so far. So I hope this helps you out. If you guys are interested in more essentials, I have a video right here that you guys can watch and I will catch you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Summing you guys already do the absolute basics to look good like getting a haircut, trimming your body hair, washing your face, et cetera. This video is going to be more so about the more advanced techniques. You ain't gonna see it coming, come on, look! Hey! Okay, not like super advanced, this shit's pretty easy to do, but it's more so tips that you probably never heard before and these are gonna give you that extra 20% on your looks. So my first trick is bringing your skincare down to your neck. Why should you do this? This is why. Do you want your neck to look like you're nutsack in a few years? My guess is not. So when doing your skincare routine, if you have a toner, moisturizer, sunscreen, serum, just bring those down to your neck so that later on your nickname's not gonna be chicken joke. And my second trick is to apply Vaseline to your cuticles. As somebody who's always struggled with hangnails, I realized how important it was to keep your cuticles moisturized because your hands are a very good indicator of how good your hygiene is according to women. So if your hands look like Master Shredder was up in there and just slashed your hands, you can best be assured, she's gonna be pretty turned off. So make sure that you're applying Vaseline to your cuticles every day, or you can also buy a cuticle oil as well, which is just as good. And number three is to use a hair mask once a week. A hair mask is very similar to a face mask in the way that you leave it on for a substantial amount of time and it's going to deeply hydrate that area. You typically leave it in a hair mask for about an hour before you end up washing it out. And it's gonna leave your hair looking like bloody Lord Farquhar. Ah, perfect. Four is more so something that's going to save you time and also prevent further hair damage. And that is a continuous hair spray bottle. I know you guys all recognize this, your barber or your hairdresser will use this to wet your hair before they cut it. And the reason I love this thing is because I usually would have a shower before the gym just to reset my hair, because it looks like ass first thing in the morning. And then I would come back an hour and a half later, just to have another shower, and then have another shower later on in the evening. That is so unhealthy, not only for your hair, but for your skin as well. And using this, obviously, you're not getting your hair completely soaked. It's going to just wet it so that you can readjust your hair, make it look good. And it's also not going to damage it, because it's not hot water either. Now this next one should be pretty obvious, but I feel like a lot of people don't actually own one of these, and that is a tongue scraper. If you're constantly told that you have bad breath, it could be one of three things. The first one, you don't floss your teeth well enough. Second, you haven't scraped your tongue. Third, you have a bacterial infection. But 90% of the time, your bad breath is going to come from your tongue. So the tongue scraper does exactly what it sounds like it would do. You scrape the food off of your tongue and it's going to keep your breath smelling a lot more fresh. Six is to buy yourself two facial serums. You're gonna want a vitamin C serum, which you're gonna apply first thing in the morning, and then you'll want a retinol serum that you're gonna apply at nighttime. And what a vitamin C serum does is it helps boost your collagen production, which is the protein that helps your skin look firm and youthful. It's also going to help even out and brighten up your complexion. So if you have dark spots or just uneven color in your face, the vitamin C serum is going to do a great job at evening that all out. And the retinol serum, like I said, you're gonna wanna apply this one at nighttime. And what the retinol does is it helps prevent fine lines and wrinkles. is also going to increase the cell turnover rate, which means it's going to produce new skin faster. And it's also very good if you have bumpy and rough skin, so if your skin is very uneven in texture, the retinol serum is absolutely perfect for this. Number seven is to use a facial steamer every once in a while. What I'm showing you guys here is not a facial steamer. This is a regular steamer I use for my clothes. Do not use this. I only use it because essentially it does the same thing and I know how far to hold it from my face without burning it. But they essentially do the same thing and what the facial steamer is going to do going to help loosen up that dirt in your face. So it's gonna make your cleansing process so much easier. It's also going to make your products more effective because it's going to help the products actually soak into your face. Next up is derma rolling, in addition with rosemary oil on your eyebrows. Quick question for you guys. Have you guys seen that bold glamour TikTok filter that makes everybody look fucking gorgeous? Do you know what it does? It just makes your eyebrows and your beard way thicker. It also does give you a bit of a tan as well. But the main thing is, is your eyebrows get super thick. Look at this difference between this guy thin eyebrows versus this guy with darker eyebrows. He clearly looks more attractive, the guy with the darker eyebrows. So you can achieve this by using the derma roller, which has been proven to help with hair regrowth because it brings blood flow to the area. And then you can apply the rosemary oil, which has been proven to be as effective as 2% minoxidil. So in combination with these two things, you can actually make your eyebrows thicker over time, which is pretty sweet. Now this video is gonna be of no use to you if you haven't gotten down the basics yet. So if you haven't gotten the basics, I just did this video a few weeks ago on the six easiest steps to become a more attractive guy that I would suggest you go watch this first, implement those, and then you can come back to this video and implement the things in these videos. Far from that guys, I hope you enjoyed today's video and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Just because it's auto-tied does not mean you need to dress like this. You can still achieve a stylish look while feeling cool at the same time if you utilize the right items. And one of the first right items to utilize is a linen shirt. Linen is probably the most breathable fabric that money can buy. And it's actually quite luxurious looking fabric, if you ask me. And there's two ways that I go about styling the linen shirt. The first way is just tits out, You know, the real manslet look with two chains on. Two chains. Not two chains, but two pendant necklaces. And typically this is my go-to beach fit with some nice linen pants. Or you got the second option, which is layering over top of a tank top, just a real conservative look. This is like an everyday fit that you can just wear out to wherever you go and not look like an absolute slut. Second item is a vest. And I would say that this is more for an evening situation, like a dinner, because it can actually look quite classy if you pair it with the right bottoms and shoes. And this is a piece that's gonna make you look quite unique is I rarely see anybody wearing these, which means it's a massive opportunity for you to actually stand out. Our third item is pleated cargoes, and again, this is a very unique design. This is something that I only recently found out was even a thing. I didn't even know pleated cargoes existed. And what is a pleated cargo versus a regular cargo? Well, what pleated means is that it has these vertical lines that go down the middle, which makes it look like quite classy, and it's actually got a slimmer design, which means it's gonna be way more versatile for different situations. If you did want to go to a more dress-up occasion, you actually can wear these apart from a regular pair of cargoes where you look like an absolute bum because it's more of a casual item. And number four is shorts, but not just any shorts. The king of versatility, board shorts. So if you ever see some sexy ladies at a lake, you pull over to the side of the road real quick, send a fat gainer off the top, land in the water like an absolute stud, let him know that you're the Tog G. And then you get out and you look like you're just wearing a regular pair of swim trunks unlike the guy that tried to do the exact same thing, but he was in sweatshorts and they're absolutely drenched. You tell me which one's the girl gonna choose. My case is closed. Next up, which is one of my personal favorites, which is the Crochet Knit Sweater Polo. Crochet Knit, not Croquet Knit. Boys, I got it right. The Crochet just gives you this beautiful texture while keeping you cool because obviously you got bloody holes in your shirt. But when you pair these with linen pants, you have the God tier outfit. It is just a chef's kiss. Now speaking of linen trousers, which is our next essential, I'd suggest that you get two of them. I'd go for a white pair and a beige pair so that you can mix and match with whatever your heart desires. I would just make sure that you get one with a button and one with a drawstring so that you have one for each situation. If you wanna go for a dapper, dressed up look, you got the one with the button. If you want the beach, casual vibes, you got the one with the drawstring. Now number seven is summer footwear and that means sandals and slip-on loafers baby. And when it comes to sandals, I would say that Disciple 12s are probably your best bet. They feature premium straps with a ridiculously comfortable sole and they just look so good on the feet. But you don't, you don't agree? You know what's the funny thing is that I'm not actually joking. I do actually like these, but there are lots of other options. If you don't like these, but when it comes to our second shoe, which is slip on loafers, these give off the my daddy owns the company vibes. They just look so elegant. They're simple and you can take them to the beach, slip them on and off. It doesn't get easier than that, bro. And number eight, the ultimate summer essential, the white beater, the tank top, the undershirt, whatever you wanna call it. They just make achieving that layering look so easy without making you too hot. They're really affordable too. I buy mine from Haynes for like $23. It comes in a three pack and you can also wear them to the gym. It is a win-win situation. And number nine is bold pattern camp-colored shirts. Boys, the summertime is when you start to wear the bold colors and the patterns. It's basically the time when you say to the ladies, I'm single, I'm ready to mingle, and you flock your feathers and it's your maiden call. Lots of brands already have these out. Zara has a massive collection of really cool pattern shirts. The best way to style these is utilizing our undershirt and you wear these with some shorts or some linen pants and you got a solid ass outfit. And since this video is about summer, I'm sure that you guys want to look your best before summer actually arrives. And I just did this video over here on the items that you need to have a glow up for under $1,000. And I definitely recommend you guys check that out."

        "transcript": " I'm gonna go over everything that you need to be an absolute giga-chat. Every product slash item, every dude needs to be an absolute stud and I'm gonna do it with a budget of a thousand dollars. Little FYI, I'm not being paid by any of these brands that I recommend today. These are either items that are used currently or I've used in the past. So starting with our first thing is grooming tools and every guy is going to need a trimmer and you'll need at least two. You'll need one for your face and one for your balls. And if your face is like mine and you can't grow shit, It's better to just go clean shaven so what I've been using since I can remember is a philips series 3000 this will give you a really nice closed shave without having all the razor bumps Which is really nice, but if you're one of my guys that grows a full beard There's gonna be obviously a few more things that you guys need to maintain your beard So you're gonna need a good trimmer or a pair of clippers You can use the hair clippers as well for your face that works as well Second thing you'll need is a brush so that you can brush it down make sure it's looking clean third thing you'll need is a beard oil so you can keep it soft and smelling good. And as for your body, which applies to everybody, I have both the Gillette Intimate and I have the Philips Series 5000 and both of these work really well for grooming your body. But if you prefer to go find your own trimmer, I just recommend that you find one that has a bunch of different guard lengths so that you can, you know, adjust depending on where you're going to be trimming. Number two, you'll need a skincare routine. First thing that you're gonna need is obviously a cleanser. It's totally gonna depend on what skin type you have, But as for an overall brand that really works for a lot of people is Sarah V They've really got a down pack there But as for specifics if you have oily skin I'd recommend going for the Sarah V foaming cleanser or the SA renewing cleanser and if you have dry skin I'd go for the Sarah V hydrating cleanser next thing you want is an exfoliant You want to use this about like two times a week and the one that I recommend is polish choice BHA or you can also use a Retinol serum by Sarah V which works really well as well and as for your moisturizer if you have dry skin I'd go for the Sarah V moisturizing cream or the La Roche Posse Tolerane double repair face cream and as for oily skin I personally use I'm not you're gonna try to pronounce it. I put it up on the screen here It's a Korean brand, but this is a really nice lightweight moisturizer That doesn't cause too much oil and the final product in the skincare category You're gonna need a good SPF and the one that I recommend for everybody is the La Roche Posse Mineral sunscreen because it doesn't have any of those chemicals that cause cancer. It's just a really clean mineral sunscreen now You also have skin elsewhere on your body apart from your face So you're gonna need a good body skin care routine as well So the first thing that you're gonna need is an exfoliant mitt that you can do this in the shower Two to three times a week to remove your dead skin cells and then right after you get out of the shower You're gonna want a body lotion and the Sarah V moisturizing lotion is very good for this now moving on to the top of your head This is the hair section. We all have different hair types So this is gonna be more generalized I'm gonna go through every porosity of hair but for the basic necessities I would say that everybody I'd recommend that you have a leave-in conditioner so that you can keep your hair moisturized throughout the day I use the shea moisture one which allows me to have this you know kind of wet look that a lot of you guys are constantly asking about Second thing I'd recommend is hairspray. It'll give you that nice hold that you're looking for you can style your hair throw on your clothes And it's not gonna mess it up and the third thing if you have flat hair and you have no volume to your hair I'd recommend the got to be a volumizer powder this thing is insane and it actually gives you some hold at the same time. And the last product in the hair section I'd recommend is Rosemary Oil because Rosemary Oil has a lot of properties that are healthy for your hair, but it also has been proven to actually regrow hair. So just as a precaution, you start using this now just to prevent any hair loss. Now the next one is really underrated and a lot of people just bypass this, but taking care of your hands is super important guys. So it's important that you guys go and buy an actual manicure set so you can take care of your nails. And the next thing that every handsome guy needs is a good signature fragrance you can wear every day. And because we're trying to do this thousand dollar budget, I'm gonna keep it to about $115 and under. So a few really good options are like Aqua de Gio Perfumo, Jean-Paul Gauthier Le Mal, Chanel Allure Homme Sport, Versace pour Homme, Prada L'Homme, or Hugo Boss Bottled. Now, onto your money maker, your smile. So a feasible purchase for a lot of you guys that you can do at your comfort of your home is the Cress White Trips. I use this all the time. I've had very little sensitivity. You can have sensitivity to your teeth if you use this every single day, but you just space them out enough, and this is gonna give you very similar results to doing it in a professional environment, but you're gonna pay a lot less for it. And the next one is probably the most important, and it's gonna affect your overall appearance, but it's also going to affect your confidence as well. I don't know if you guys can guess what it is, but it's the gym. Gyms are so affordable now that you really have no excuse to not go. You can get in a gym for like $15 to $20 a month. You can skip a fast food meal at least once or twice this month so that you can afford a gym membership. And if you are gonna go to the gym, the thing that I would also recommend pairing with that, this is the second thing you'll need is some creatine. And I would say that this is the only supplement that's actually worth taking. You can get your protein from your food, your BCAAs, all that other stuff. It's just extra stuff that's unnecessary and it's all marketing so that they get you to purchase more things. But creatine has been the only one that's actually proven to help build muscle mass. So if you're just starting out in the gym, Creatine I definitely recommend putting those two together creatine in the gym that completes our list That's really all you need guys to be attractive and our total comes up to 791 dollars and 51 cents Remember this could be cheaper too, and you don't have to go and all purchase this in one day This could be you know purchase throughout the course of a year and these products will last you quite a long time as well Anyways, I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya"

        "transcript": " With all the social media fashion gurus telling you what items you need to be stylish, you must be thinking, God damn, I'm gonna go broke trying to be stylish, because there's like a trillion items I keep getting recommended to me. I feel you, which is why I have dissected it down into eight bare minimum essentials every single guy needs to be stylish, starting with our first item, which is a watch. Only does a watch tell the time, which is pretty cool, don't know if you knew that, but it also demands respect. It's almost like when you put on a watch, people just assume that you got your life together. I don't know, that's the impression I get subconsciously. See this guy's wearing a nice watch. I'm like, yeah, that dude's probably wealthy. He's probably got a good family You know, it's got a good head on the shoulders. It's kind of like a well-tailored suit But for your wrist if you know what I mean So when it comes to which color watch should you buy I would say go for a white face dial and a black face dial as your first two watches Because that will kind of cover all of your different scenarios and outfits and as for which metal do you choose? It completely depends on what metals you typically wear. I typically wear silver jewelry So I went with a silver watch But if you wear gold get yourself a gold bracelet and when it comes to brands if you guys want an affordable affordable watch that's actually decent quality. I would look at Hamilton, Tiso, Seaco, or Timex. You're gonna get some really good quality over there for a decent price. Skin is a pocket organizer. And a pocket organizer is essentially a bi-fold wallet, but instead of it being so wide, it's actually taller vertically, which gives it this really elegant look. While keeping it slim in your pocket, because the last thing you want is that massive bulge in your pocket and it's not your dick, it's your wallet, which just looks like trash. And as somebody who carries a decent amount of credit cards in cash, this was a much better option than my previous card holder, which virtually held nothing. Third item is a woman's jewelry box. Ah, now we'll see how fragile some of you guys' masculinity is. No, I'm joking guys, a jewelry box is a jewelry box. This is an Adam and a object, there's no gender. All right, chill out. And I imagine if you guys follow me and you take some of my advice, you have some accessories, so you want a place to put it, keep it nice and clean, make sure that it's not getting scratched and keep it organized, and the jewelry box is the way to go. I bought this one from Zara Home. It's also a furniture piece because it looks really good on my side table. And the nice thing about having a jewelry box is that whenever you go traveling or you want to bring your accessories with you somewhere, you can just have it all in your box in one place instead of throwing it all into your bag and then have the chance of either losing it or getting all your stuff tangled in scratch. The other item is a toiletry bag. And for so long, I was just throwing all of my stuff in a ziploc bag. So when I would go to hotels or stuff, I would just look like it was homeless. And then the second thing that would always happen is my shit would just explode everywhere. So it opened up this bag and it's just drenched with toothpaste or soap or whatever it was. There's always something exploding. So I went and I bought one from Amazon. This is an XL size two compartment leather toiletry bag. And this fits all of my skincare products. And the nice thing is that you can separate your products that will spill and the ones that won't. And then also because it's padded now, the likelihood of things spilling is very unlikely. Like I've never had anything spill once I've had this bag because of that extra cushioning. Fifth item is a leather belt. and you only need one, just a nice black leather belt. It makes your outfit look more put together. If you wanna add some contrast to your outfit or just raise your visual waistline, the biggest mistake that you can make when it comes to buying a belt is buying one of those designer belts with a massive belt buckle. Like it just looks so unbelievably tacky. It will ruin your outfit, trust me. Sixth thing is a nice carry-on. And just like you buy yourself a nice backpack, you also wanna buy yourself a carry-on. Let me read it right myself, a carry-on, guys. Not your check luggage. We know how they treat our check luggage. Those things get ragdolled and destroyed. real quick, but with your carry-on luggage, you personally take care of your carry-on luggage. I'm not saying you need to buy a Karl Friedrich or Rimoire, whatever they're called, too expensive for me to pronounce. Just something that looks good. I spent $160 on this one from Amazon. It looks really nice. It does the same things as the Rimoire and the Karl Friedrich, but I spent $160 on it. Seventh thing is caps. Now, there's a few different styles that you could go for. You could go for the trucker hat, which I think looks really good when it comes to streetwear. Also, Also for the summertime, it's got the mesh, so if your head gets really hot, probably one of the better choices. You've also got the dad cap, which is my personal favorite. I just think if you're gonna go for the whole breezy vibes with the linen pants and the button-down shirt, which is what I wear a lot, dad cap goes the best with those. And then you got your typical baseball hat, which looked really good with any outfit that's just casual. And number eight is a pennant necklace, and I can't stress this enough, guys. This is the one accessory that I would say that every single guy needs. It just makes your outfit look more interesting. It adds a bit of personality depending on the style that you choose. And the third incentive is that girls think it's super hot. If that's gonna push you over to buy it, there you go. Girls think it's mad attractive. Now that you guys got your accessories, I've also got this video here on spring essentials that every guy needs. So if you don't have them yet, go check out this video and then I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Now, it's not very hard to stand out from the average guy because the average guy looks like this. But you don't even want to look remotely close to the guy. You want to look like this guy. That's right, that's me. I'm a stud. I'm ballsy. I don't take no sh** from anyone. I'm only kidding. But you do want to dress and look the best that you possibly can. So if you follow these seven tips that I'm about to outline in today's video, you're going to take your outfits to the next level. Starting with the first tip is to wear smart trousers. As you start to understand what makes a good outfit, you really start to realize that your pants make the biggest difference in your outfit. For example, here I'm wearing black pants on both sides, but as you can clearly see, the trouser on the right with the pleat line and the nice taper just makes the outfit look so much better. Once again, here we have the exact same outfit on both sides except one is a high-waisted trouser and it just looks way more premium than the denim alternative. Now you can still keep these outfits casual implementing these smart trousers, but it It just gives you that little bit more elegant, premium, casual look. But you also have the luxury of being able to smarten up the look a lot if you want to as well. So you kind of get the best of both worlds with these pants. Now the best brands to find these quality trousers are Club Monaco, Uniqlo, Costs and Banana Republic. Second tip is to implement the rule of thirds into your outfit. So when you look at these two outfits, which one looks better? Assuming you have some sort of fashion sense, you said the right side, if you didn't, you need to watch my videos again. Now why the right side? because the right side is using the rule of thirds. And the rule of thirds is when two thirds of your outfit is taken up by your pants and the other one third comes from your upper layers. And that is what helps you create this beautiful silhouette. Now on the left, we have the common one and a half split where the clothes land dead even in the middle, which just looks meh. So to easily implement the rule of thirds into your outfit, try tucking in your shirt so that you can raise that visual waistline or buy cropped items that stop right around your waistline. Third tip is to invest in quality basics right from the beginning. Do not make the mistake that I did where I just went and I bought poor quality things where I had to replace it every single month. I ended up spending more money than I would have if I had just gone and bought the nice one to begin with. So investing in high quality basics is not only gonna last you a lot longer, but it's also going to come in higher quality fabrics and materials. Now I'm not saying to go buy a $400 Gucci shirt because a Gucci shirt and a Uniqlo shirt is probably the exact same quality, so don't do that. I'm more so speaking about things like your sweaters. If you're gonna buy a sweater, buy cashmere, buy wool. Same goes for your jackets. If you want a leather jacket, buy a real leather one or go for wool. Buying these fabrics will not only last you a lot longer, but they're also gonna look a lot better as well because of that hint of texture that these fabrics have. Fourth tip is to surround yourself with stylish people. We've all heard the saying that you are the average of your five closest friends. So if you would not consider your friends very well dressed, well maybe you should find a new friend group. Or the other option, which is probably more appealing to do, is consume content from people who you consider stylish. Fill your social media with people who inspire you, who have style that you love. In turn, this is gonna end up training your eye to spot pieces at stores that can achieve the look that you're going for. Because after all, being stylish is an actual skill and something that you'll need to train. Fifth tip is, your tailor is your best friend. Almost every item that you've ever seen me wear on this channel has been altered in some sort of way by the tailor. Whether it was a shirt that I got cropped to sit higher on my waist or a pair of pants that seemed to fit my legs and my waist absolutely perfectly. It's because I've taken it to the tailors to get it altered, guys. So the main ones that I get done is a hem on my pants, which is where I get her to cut the pant leg, so it falls right at the top of my shoes. And also, depending on how wide my pants are, I might get her to slim it down. So what I ask for is called a taper, and that's basically where she cuts down the pant leg diagonally so that it gets slimmer as it goes towards my ankle. And if the waist is too big, which it typically is, I ask her to take in the waist. As for my shirts, I ask her to crop it so that it falls at mid-fly. And then for my jackets, and my sleeves are a bit too long, and I'll ask her to adjust my sleeves so that they land right at my wrist bone. Number six is to add tasteful accessories. You guys know how much I stress accessories because without accessories, your outfit just looks bland. Now I'm not saying you need to have a ton of accessories. You just need some ones that are tasteful, angular, simplistic, ones that you can implement into all of your outfits. I get almost all of my jewelry from Surge N' Nimes and I actually have a 15% off discount code for you guys and that will be linked in my description if you wanna cop some stuff. And number seven is to pay attention to the details. Brust, steam and lint remove your clothes, man. You can make the sickest outfit look like absolute garbage by not derinkling it. Buy yourself a portable steamer. This is gonna save you so much time, make your clothes look good, and you don't have to whip out the iron all the time. Two, buy yourself a lint shaver. This is gonna remove all of those annoying pills, keeping your wool and your knit sweaters looking good. And number three is to buy yourself a lint remover, because if you ever plan on wearing black clothes, you're gonna need it, because you're gonna get white fluffs absolutely everywhere. Now, if you guys want some advice on what quality basics to buy, so you can formulate your outfits. I got this video right here on the right, and this will help you out. Enjoy."

        "transcript": " This is probably the worst fit I've ever seen. Oh my God. What is going on? Two out of 10. Two out of 10 for sure. It looks terrible. So, you already know what this video is. You guys have sent me in your outfits and you wanted your boy to rate them. So that's what I'm gonna do today. I'm not gonna hold back. I'm gonna give you the honest truth and let's get right into these outfits. So I'm not laughing because of your outfit. I'm laughing just because of the picture it looks like it was taken on a camera in the early 1900s. But the actual outfit itself is quite good. I like what you've done with your flannel. I like with the rolled up sleeves. You take the tips, obviously. The linen pants looks fantastic, white sneakers. Nice clean outfit. I just think that you need some accessories. But I would give this a solid 7.5, dude. It's a nice outfit, good job. So completely different aesthetic on this one. The last one was more old money. Now this is a street style. And I think he's done a really good job with this. I really like the fleece, the cargoes. He's matched the shoes nicely with the entire fit, Jordan fours. He's got the accessories on. Good shit, dude. That's honestly a fire fit. I'd give this a solid eight. This next one, he's going for a summer look. It obviously looks like he's somewhere that's nice and hot. And it's monochromatic. So the one thing that I would say with this outfit that I would personally change is I would go for some pants that are a little bit looser fit because when you're going for a summer look, you wanna go for something a little bit breezier and just the pants look a little bit restrictive to me. And because you're wearing Air Force Ones too, you would want a little bit wider of a fit pants. The outfit, I would give it a solid seven. Pfft! What the f*** is that? Obviously this is a joke. I don't think he expects to get a high rating on this, but I'm gonna give him a high one because this is probably the most fantastic outfit that's gonna be in this video. I'll give it 10 out of 10. Oh, I really like this one. This is literally an outfit that I create myself. You pretty much killed it on this one. So he's matched up his watch very nicely with his belt. He's got the pearl necklace on, tank, lowy shirts. Got some nice trousers on. Dude, it's solid. I mean, I can't see your shoes. You really could have just messed it up with your shoes because I have no idea. You could be wearing some golf boots where you got spikes going out like six feet on each side. So based on what I can see, dude, I would give this a solid 8.9. Like it's almost nine out of 10, which is like practically the best you can get. All right, so we got a denim jacket outfit. I do like this. You've done really well with your proportions here. I like that you have a cropped jacket and then you've done the black pants. Are those paint splattered pants? I think they are. You just got a bunch of white stains on it because you've been doing a little bit of this. White shoes, always good choice. It does look like you got one ring on your left hand, and then you got a side bag. Dude, it's solid fit. I love what you've done with your proportions. The only thing I'd change is maybe adipendent necklace, but I'd give you an eight. Ooh, my boy is suited up. Look at his face, look at his smile on his face. He just knows, he's like, yeah, I'm getting laid tonight. Ta-da! He's stunning, he's shining. But dude, the suit looks really good. I love that red tie and then your little pocket square. I think the colors that you've implemented into the suit look really, really well done. I would say that your sleeves, I can't tell, maybe it's just me, but it looks like your sleeves might be a little bit too long because they are crinkling up quite a bit. But apart from that, dude, the colors are absolutely immaculate. I'd give this a solid 8.5. What in the conjuring do is going on here? What? This guy's in full on possession. Oh, my God. He's really breaking his back in this picture. Dude, this might be the Guinness World Record for the highest standing two foot jump. He's literally 10 feet off the ground. All right, let's move on. Wow, I like this. So the pants that he's wearing is exactly what I was trying to articulate at the beginning with that other guy who had pants that were a little bit too slim in my opinion. This is the kind of look that I would have gone for with what you were wearing. With his outfit, he's done extremely well. He's got the Air Forces on too. He's got a nice blue striped, loose fit shirt, totally going for the summer look. And he's tied his watch with his shoes and his shoes. Checkmark is also blue as well. got the sunnies on. Dude, you killed it with this outfit. I'd give this 8.7. My bad guys, I just realized they're not actually Air Force One's they're Jordans, but doesn't change my rating. I just wanted to make sure I don't sound like an absolute idiot. Wow, this is another good outfit. Dude, you guys are actually insanely good at styling. I'm surprised, you don't even need me. Like why even bother watching me? You guys already do what I would do. So he's done the outfit perfectly in my opinion. I would say that the only downfall on his outfit is just, he's got a bit too many accessories for my liking. He's got three chains on, quite a large wrist bracelet. He's also got a watch on and it looks like he's wearing two rings. So my personal opinion, I would just maybe take away a few accessories but the actual outfit itself, very good dude. You've done an excellent job. And I'd give this one a 8.5. Oh buddy, he's absolutely dice. Look at him, he's freaking shredded. So the actual outfit itself, very well done. Again, nice and simplistic, white sneakers, blue with black, very easy to pull off. He's got his accessories. Not much that would change with the outfit. Personally, I like putting a little white, white beater underneath, but it looks good without it, dude. Honestly, 8.5, again. Hold on a second, is that me? Dude, I swear I've worn this exact same outfit before. Did you send this to me intentionally knowing that I've worn this and that I would give you a high rating? Bastard. All jokes aside, I do think this is a nice outfit. I've worn it before. I love the way the tan goes with the black. I would say that the only downfall with your outfit is your sleeves do look a bit too long. So what I would do, my friend, is just take it to the tailor for maybe $10, $15. Get your sleeves pinned, and it's gonna make your outfit just look way more premium. I'd give this a 7.5. Okay, with this one, it's extremely bland. You know, you look like Steve Jobs a bit, no offense. But I think that this is a solid foundation. I think you just need to add a bit more spice. An outfit like this, I would try to layer something on top, and if it's a bit too hot to do so, I would maybe tuck it in, add a belt, or at least get a sweater that's got some texture on it so that you have a little bit more interest in your outfit. So I'd give this a 6.5, just cause it's a little bit basic. Okay, nice, I like the vest. This is something we haven't seen yet. He's got a nice sweater vest on with a T-shirt underneath, pearl necklace, converse, I think, and some nice pants that fit him extremely well. Dude, this is a solid fit too. I would just say you're missing something on your wrist. You need something on your wrist and maybe some rings. But apart from that, very, very well thought through. I would give this a 7.5. All right, a dapper fit. I like what you've done here. The watch looks extremely elegant. You got the black face, so it goes really well with your black overcoat. And then you've got, I can't tell if that's a mock neck or a turtleneck. But dude, it looks clean. Again, I can't see your shoes, but from what I can see, I'd give this an 8.5. Oh, okay, this is an interesting one. This is not something that a lot of people will do. It looks like he's wearing some sort of satin long sleeve shirt over top of a turtleneck. I like the texture clash that you got going on there. He's also mixing matching metals, which is typically a style ruler, whatever, but I actually like what he's done here. I think it works extremely well. He's got the gold on his belt, and then he's got a little bit of brown there too. I think everything works extremely well. I would give this an 8.3. It's very nice. Oh, dude, this has got to be the cleanest outfit of the video. Apart from his pants being rolled up so high, like he's walking through flooded streets. If they were down, dude, this is the cleanest fit I've seen so far. I love how you've matched the bottom of your shoe with your sweater. And I actually like the polo or whatever, the long sleeve shirt that you're wearing underneath with the collar coming out. Dude, it's so clean. You got all the accessories on too. If your pants weren't rolled so high, This would be a nine out of 10, cleanest fit I've seen so far. Okay, so for this one right off the bat, there's definitely some improvement to be made here. I don't want you to take this personally person that's watching this and sees himself on the screen. This is literally constructive criticism. So a few things that I would change with your outfit, your shirt, I would just go for something that's more minimalistic because you've already got a lot going on with your plaid. So I would just go for either a white T-shirt or a black one. And for your pants, I would get rid of the jogger pants and go for something that doesn't have a cuff. jogger pants used to be popular, not so much now. And as for your shoes, I would look for a white sneaker if you can. You don't need to spend a ton of money on white sneakers. I even find tons at the thrift store. So go look there first before you invest any money into like a more expensive shoe. But with all of that being said, the one thing that got down is the colors. All the colors do work together. So I would give this outfit probably a five out of 10 because I think there's a lot to improve on here. All right, so with this fit, very baggy. Definitely not my style. And once again, I can appreciate other styles, streetwear, which is clearly what he's going for here. The colors work very well. I love the knit beanie. And I can't tell what shoes you're wearing, some sort of Jordan. It looks good. I think you just need some rings. And I would give this a 7.5 out of 10. Pretty interesting jacket you're wearing here. Not my style, but once again, I can appreciate other styles as well. He's wearing a black pants with a white shirt, so it does work together. You know, and he's got no clashing there. The one thing, immediately, one of my biggest pet peeves is wearing runners with a casual outfit. Keep the runners for your athleisure wear, for your gym outfits. When it comes to your casual outfits, wear a sneaker or a boot, I think that would work a lot better. So with this outfit, I would give it probably a 6.5 out of 10 just because of the runners. All right, and for the last outfit of the day, because this video is probably 11 or 12 minutes long already, got this dude wearing pretty clean outfit. I would say right away the one thing that I would change is probably the shoes. I think the Air Forces weren't the move for this. I think it stands out a bit too much. It being white as well and a chunkier sneaker and you're wearing slimmer pants. I would go with something a bit more slim like a nice Converse or even a black boot. But apart from that, the other parts of the outfit work really well together. I would give this for the final rating of the day a 7.3 out of 10. But wow, I am honestly shocked. You guys did such an amazing job. I don't know why you even need to bother watching me anymore to be honest. because it seems like you know what you're doing.

        "transcript": " Standards for men are starting to get out of hand. Guys need to make a ridiculous amount of money. He's got to be six foot plus. He's got to have a Goliath wiener. These standards are starting to become more and more unrealistic. But don't let that lead you into thinking that if you don't have these things, that you're going to be forever alone. Because if you focus on doing these six things I'm about to talk about in today's video, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to become the best version of yourself and you will be able to land 99% of women. So my first tip is to fix your teeth. Your smile is probably one of the most important factors when it comes to attraction. We hear girls say this all the time in those videos where they're like, what do you look for in a guy? And they're always nice smiles. The smile. Bad teeth, done. Smile? Smile really gives a smile. So Invisalign was probably the number one decision that I ever made in terms of enhancing my appearance. For reference, here's what my teeth used to look like before versus now. My shit used to look like it was rocked by Mike Tyson's gray look. And unlike your clothes, your teeth is something that's going to somewhat last you a lifetime. So if your teeth are mangled, get yourself some braces. If you can't even fathom ever affording braces, or if you just already have straight teeth, get yourself an at home whitening kit like Crest White Ships. Getting a nice white smile will help significantly as well. My second tip is to focus on grooming and your hygiene. Bro, most guys don't even do the bare minimum. So if you just step up your game even a little bit, it's going to set you apart from 90% Dude get haircuts frequently it's gonna keep you looking fresh if you can't afford to get haircuts frequently buy yourself one of those Three-way mirrors watch a YouTube video and learn how to do it yourself same goes for your beard if you have a beard keep it lined up Keep it hygienic second thing maintain proper mouth hygiene floss your teeth every single day tongue scrape every single day your body Make sure that you're using an exfoliant mitt two times a week to get rid of all your dead skin cells Also use an unscented body wash so that you can get rid of all the stench in those areas and a highly underrated one is buying unique fragrances every dude has your safari bloody Chanel Aqua did you a perfume or Versace arrows you want to be able to walk past a girl and her be like oh my god I smell so good what is he wearing not damn I do it smells like my brother my dad and my ex-boyfriend so I suggest looking at niche fragrances and what are niche fragrances niche fragrances are companies that specifically design fragrances only unlike designer brands like Gucci Dior Chanel that make bags they They make luggage, they make makeup, they make fragrances, they make clothing. They're mixing in a bunch of other things, but these companies niche fragrances only focus on creating fragrances, so they make the best and most unique sense. Number three is to hit the gym frequently. Bro, if you're not in good shape, you are doing yourself a massive disservice. Hitting the gym even three times a week is going to significantly change your body's composition. And not only that, the biggest confidence changes I've seen in people have happened when they've gone to the gym and made some sort of progress. I've literally trained some of the most frail and shy people and within a matter of a year, they've completely transformed into an outgoing and confident person. It's absolutely insane. It's the number one most impactful habit that you can implant into your life to change it. But along with the gym, you also need to have a healthy diet, because at this point, food companies are literally trying to kill you. They put so many chemicals in it. This is another topic, but rather than going to the grocery and buying food, go to your butchers or your farmer's market, get something that's organic, find out where the food is being made, what the animals are getting fed, and that way you can ensure you're gonna be getting the best quality food. If you can't afford to go to the butchers, at least learn about these different compounds and chemicals so you can pick and choose as to what you're eating when you go to the grocery store. Number four is to work on your style. And of course, as I'm a fashion channel, I obviously would have to mention this. Your first impression is huge. And as much as you like to entertain the idea that people shouldn't judge you based off of what you wear, they do. So if you're trying to feel more confident, you're trying to get more girls, whatever you're trying to achieve, having a style that suits your body and looks good on you is going to help with those things. So my advice is to look at the people that inspire you, look at the way that they dress, incorporate some of their style into yours, or just copy them completely. Number five is to work on your skincare. Your skin is huge and having clear skin is attractive because when you see a person with clear skin, you automatically think, okay, this person doesn't have any underlying diseases that's showing through their skin. It's actually a primitive instinct. It's true, I'm not just making this up. And although I'm a huge believer that the food that you consume causes a lot of your acne, I would say that having a skincare routine definitely helps a lot. Quick rundown of my skincare routine is I use a cleanser, then I use toner, then I exfoliate, then I use a serum, then I hit it with a moisturizer, and lastly, the most important is I use a mineral SPF. And number six is to make your sleep a priority. If you want to guarantee it to look absolutely terrible and feel like shit, just don't sleep at all. Sleep is the number one thing that you need to look good. Regardless if you're doing any of these other tips, it's not gonna matter because your skincare routine is not gonna matter because you're gonna have these massive bags under your eyes. The gym is not gonna matter because your body's not going to be able to actually recover and you're not gonna feel motivated to improve yourself because you're gonna be absolutely exhausted. Everything depends on you getting a good night's rest. So cut a blue light an hour before bed. Don't drink coffee or caffeine after 12 p.m. Get on a consistent sleep schedule and get a minimum of seven hours of sleep every night. In combination of all the things that we've talked about by the end of 2023, you will be an absolute specimen."

        "transcript": " Before you know it, it's gonna be spring once again and all of those really sick items are gonna be sold out because all of the really smart people went in the winter time and purchased their items first, leaving you looking like a pleb when spring time comes around. But not today because you are one of those highly intelligent people that's gonna watch this video and you're gonna know which essentials to buy and where to cop them. First essential is the long sleeve polo sweater slash croquet Johnny Collar sweater polo from Avercombie. Now depending on spring and your climate, it may be extremely hot or it may be kind of cool. And the great thing about these pieces is that you can buy one in a long sleeve version or you can get it in a short sleeve version. But the really amazing part about these items is the actual texture of them. Even getting these in a neutral color, which wouldn't typically stand out as a statement piece, really does because of that interesting knit patterns. Both of these can easily be dressed up if you add a nice trouser and a belt, but you can totally dress these down too if you want to go for a more casual option. Second item is the Croquet button through sweater polo also from AberCombie. I'm not sponsored by them, I just really like their knitwear. And as you can see, these are very similar to the last two items I mentioned, but this one is typically layered over top of a tank top. And I'd say it's definitely considered more of a casual option. That being said, it is my number one choice for a hot spring day or even a nice summer day. They come in a ridiculous amount of colors, so you and your friends should not be showing up in the exact same shirt. And the fact that it's croquet once again, you have that really interesting texture clash. Number three, we have light jackets. Now I live in Canada so having a light jacket in springtime is absolutely essential. Things like lightweight bomber jackets, denim jackets, varsities, over shirts, just the essentials that will never go out of style. Next up, we have the infamous flannel. And for some reason women seem to think that this is like a superior style for men. They think that if they were a guy and they just wore flannel, they'd be instantly getting laid. I don't know why, but that being said, a flannel is still an essential. Now this flannel could be a flannel jacket like this one that I'm showing here from Zara, or it could just be a regular flannel, like this one that I thrifted. You really don't need to spend a ton of money on these because quality-wise, you're really gonna get the same quality of going from brand to brand. It's all the same, so don't feel the need to go expensive on a flannel. Our fifth item is linen pants. This is really as light as you can go when it comes to pants. Linen is the most breathable fabric you can find, so if your balls are typically swimming in an ocean by the end of the day, linen pants are for you. Linen pants come in all different colors, fits, and patterns. You can find some that have some stripes on it, or you could go for a smarter option like these, or you could even go for something that's a bit more relaxed fit if you wanna go for a breezier vibe. Zara, Banana Republic, Club Monaco, Gap, these places all sell linen pants. And number six is sneakers with a pop of color, because typically spring is the time that we start to incorporate more colors into our outfit once again. Some of my favorite sneakers are the New Balance 550s. I know a lot of people think that these shoes are dead for 2023. I don't believe so at all. I think this is gonna still carry on for all of 2023. and they got some really sick colorways. Another option that is extremely unique and not a lot of people have is the Axel Arigato Dice Low. However, they are on the more expensive side, but they got some really sick colorways. Of course, you've got Air Force Ones, which come in copious amounts as well. And something that's gaining a lot of popularity recently is the Adidas Gazelles, which I'm not a huge fan of, but hey, lots of people like. Next up, you need some relaxed fit button-up shirts. This is going to give you that old money aesthetic, the Ralph Lauren vibe. Super easy to style these, And a lot of women I know think this is an extremely attractive style. You can style it done up with a pair of denim jeans and a sneaker, or you can open those buttons up, throw a tank top underneath, rock it with a pair of trousers for a more elevated look. For just these shirts, I would look at costs, unique clothes, of course Ralph Lauren, Zara, Everlane, and Banana Republic. So go and get your items, don't wait, and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " I have just created the most perfect outfit. Oh, some of you guys intrinsically knew that something was missing there. Let me guess, it was almost as like looking at a drink without garnish or looking at the Mona Lisa and she has no eyes. That's such a terrible comparison. Accessories. If you guys guessed, accessories was missing, you were right. Accessories are just another form of self-expression. Little pieces of gold here and there can really make a huge impact on the aesthetic of your outfit. So what accessories do you choose when there is millions of different styles to choose from? Well, whenever starting anything brand new, you always want to start off with the basics. And the basics in our case is simplistic jewelry designs that you can wear every single day, no matter the outfit. Nothing with crazy designs, just something with clean angular lines. Now your next question may be, what color do I go for? Do I go for gold or do I go for silver? Well, according to every guide ever, there is a medal that complements your skin more than the others. The way you figure out what metal complements your skin is by going into some natural light and what you're gonna do is take a look at the veins in your wrist and when you look at your veins in your wrist do they appear more green or do they appear more blue? If your veins appear more green that means you have a warmer skin tone and gold is more suitable for your skin tone. If your veins appear more blue that means you have a cooler skin tone and silvers look better on your skin. But I don't follow any of that shit. I literally wear gold, I wear silver, I like both so really it doesn't matter just wear whichever one you like. The next thing is how much jewelry should you wear? Well, that totally depends. If you tend to dress more formally, maybe you just wear a ring and a watch. Or maybe you're on the complete opposite end of the spectrum where you go for a biker look and five rings, three necklaces, and a bracelet is more suitable for you. Or maybe you're right in the middle where you just go for an elevated casual outfit like myself and maybe that's two necklaces and two rings. Like I said, it totally depends on the aesthetic you're going for as well as your design choice. Thankfully, there are brands that will literally make any design that you are looking for according to your style. If you're into minimal jewelry, maybe take a look at men's side and dags and sell. They should have you covered there. Maybe you're into unique designs ranging from doves to two-door royalty. Then you'd go for something like surge denies. Maybe you're like the biker dude that I was talking about earlier, then clocks and colors is more suitable for you. Or you just don't even know what you like yet and you want something that's affordable that looks somewhat nice. Then you've got crafted London and Vitaly. Either way, there's something out there for everyone. I think The only wrong answer when it comes to accessories is to wear literally none.

        "transcript": " These are the most stylish items to wear this winter and it's not the overcoat, it's not the puffer jacket or a pair of sweatpants. Okay, maybe it is a few of those things. But let's start off with the one that's not those three and that is the Shawn the sheep looking ass jacket. The fleece jacket. It is one of the most stylish alternatives to the puffer jacket due to its amazing texture and it's also the warmest jacket you'll probably be able to find. This one that I've got here is the North Face Men's High Pile Nupt C jacket in this Gardena white and gravel coverway. I absolutely love this jacket. The color is so nice and if you know anything about North Face and Nuptsea, you'll know this shoe so bloody expensive literally Missing my leg my leg got cut off for this one So for the majority of you guys that are on a tighter budget I would go and look at Zara Zara has some really nice fleece jackets or you can look at costs as well They've got some different designs second is the classy overcoat This is one of those items that every dude needs to have in his wardrobe It's kind of like having a suit this thing will take your style to the next level as soon as you put it on instantly you look more elegant, you appear taller, and internally you just feel like you're better than everybody else when you're wearing it. I don't know why. Once again, as Zara is gonna be mentioned a million times in this video, Zara is a really good place to look for these jackets and Uniqlo is also another place for affordable, but if you're on the other end of the budget you got places like ABC, Club Monaco, Banana Republic, or Theory. Number three is a pair of corduroy pants and winter is one of the few seasons that these things really shine. To add that unique texture hint to all of your outfits, giving you some some subtle detail. And if you're always used to wearing jeans, this is the one thing that you should try. I feel like you would definitely like it and it just make your outfit look a little bit more elevated than usual. And once again, the ones I'm wearing here are from Zara. Now the next essential is a more trendy item, but I think in the past year, it's kind of solidified itself as an essential, at least for this year, which is the workwear jacket. Now these jackets just give your outfit a bit of ruggedness. It just screams. You need me to fix that for you baby with my hammer? Ha ha ha. They go extremely well with a pair of jeans for your casual outfits, but if you're feeling a bit adventurous, you can throw on a pair of trousers and you can totally elevate this outfit, make it look a bit more formal, but then add that little rugged touch with your workwear jacket. Now the one that I'm wearing here is from Abercombe, but obviously you go at Carhartt, which is the OG of these jackets. It's just a bit more on an expensive side. Next, we got the infamous high school bully starter pack jacket, the Varsity jacket. Once again, this is gonna be an extremely popular choice for this winter because of all of the variety of colors in different patches you can get, you can really express yourself, whatever that means. This jacket here, as you can see, is a fleece and varsity jacket, so you kind of get the best of both worlds. Once again, it is from Zara. Now sixth, we got one of my personal favorites, the Mocneck, the ultimate garment of versatility. The combinations of layering with this thing is absolutely endless. And if it's from Abercombe, it will sure to be the softest thing that has ever graced your skin. For real, Abercombe be having the softest knits. Now the seventh item is a pair of sweatpants. And there's two different varieties you could go for here. You could go for the cuffless or you could go for the cuff. Now the cuffless will give you that more elegant look. And as you can see here, these ones are from Express. So they got that extra pleat line there too, which you can easily dress these up and go for a more formal look even though you're wearing sweatpants. But if you're not one for dressing up and being a bit more formal, you've obviously, you've got the cinched ones. And the best place to buy these are from Abercrombie. They have the widest selection of colors and sizes. and they're super soft as well. And our final item is the wool over shirt, and specifically wool, because wool is gonna keep you far warmer than any cotton garment will in the winter time. And I've shown these specific ones plenty of times there from Zara Origins. And the reason I still promote these is because they are actually unbelievable quality. They're so well made. The stitching is perfect, and they just look so freaking good. And holy shit, guys, let's address the elephant in the room. We have just smashed 100K. We were just at 14K about two months ago, and now we're at 100. Absolutely mind blown is so crazy. I just want to thank you guys so much I really appreciate you guys following and supporting the channel as always anyways I will catch you guys in the next video. See ya"

        "transcript": " So I was just in London in Paris for two weeks and while I was there, let's just say ya boi drops some freaking bags Jose I'm just gonna share with you guys these sweet pickups. So first up we got the Nike Air Force one sneakers Seventh anniversary edition. This is probably the most detailed sneaker I've ever seen in my life It is the epitome of a fall sneaker It incorporates my two favorite things you got knit and you got brown making it the ultimate fall sneaker The whole shoe is encompassed in this knit material and it's got all sorts of different textures It's not all the same pattern, which is really cool It also features wooden egglets, which I've never seen before so if you guys ever plan on doing a lone Survivor show in the future make sure you wear these ones so you can just chop off the lace and then use it a little fire starter And on top of that the Nike Swish is in this beautifully hebbled leather which looks absolutely amazing Definitely the most unique sneaker I've ever seen. Second purchase is this felted merino half zip sweater from Everlane. I'm actually wearing one right now. And I have become a massive fan of these wool quarter zips after being enlightened by the European style. People just dress so much nicer in Europe. Like that's a fact. I was there, I felt like an absolute peasant. But these felted merino half zip sweaters are so comfortable on the skin unlike a lot of other wool products that you wear. Sometimes it's really itchy on the skin. But with these ones, I can actually wear these without a shirt if I wanted to. As you can see, the fit is absolutely immaculate. And the cord is in itself just looks so elegant and can totally be rocked by itself with just some trousers or you could throw on an overcoat or some sort of coat for extra style points. Now, my most expensive purchase on this trip was this side bag from this iconic French band called Frélechpage. I literally refused to buy a Dior Gucci or Louis Vuitton. Those brands are just too mainstream and they're not great quality either. So I decided to go with this iconic low-key French brand that very few people know. The bag that I bought is in this luxurious dark brown color that can practically go with any outfit and it just adds that little accessory to the outfit making it look a lot more put together. Next up is the Relax Fit Bullchain Knit Jumper from KOS. So I gotta stop this video for a second because I just said Bullchain Knit. It's Buclay. What the hell are you on about, Brandon? Anyways, this is a great time to tell you guys. You should probably subscribe and like the video if you're enjoying it so far. As the name suggests, it is relaxed fit, so it sits extremely comfortable on the body and the bull chain. It's boucle is so unbelievably soft too. And as you guys know, I'm an absolute fiend for texture. So when I saw this, I was in absolute awe because that extra texture just makes the garment look so much more elevated. And when combined with another layer, and you got the ultimate outfit. And the fifth purchase is this puffer jacket from Zara Origins. And it totally gives me concept slash futuristic slash alien vibes. It kind of reminds me of those concept cars that Audi does for like 2030. It just looks like that, but in a garment. And also where the seams connect, it looks very similar to that Yeezy Balenciaga hoodie where it's scrunched up and rounded at the bottom. Another interesting feature on this is that it actually has no zipper. So this thing is meant to be styled open so you can show off the layers underneath. So I thought this was super unique and I was like, definitely caught. Now for our sixth item, we have some jewelry from Surge Denims and this is their new Tudor collection. I got this silver red necklace which I've been wearing a lot recently, along with the silver rend ring, which has the exact same design as the necklace. I also got this two-door cross ring, which I'm absolutely in love with the detail on this one, and the fact that you can see your finger through is pretty cool. And the next item is this Zara flannel jacket. Once again, you can tell I'm into the brown tones this fall. Quality-wise, it's nothing special. I mainly purchased it due to the pattern and the color combo, but the fit is everything that you'd want it to be for a flannel jacket. It's roomy enough to put something underneath it, but it's not so baggy that it's gonna look weird if you just wear a t-shirt. So guys, those are my pickups that I got while I was away. I hope you enjoyed today's video and found some inspo. If you did, please smash that like button, hit that subscribe button, and I will catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " I can take this one item and style it five different ways. How is that possible? Because it's a timeless basic and most people's wardrobe looks like something out of a Wreck-It Ralph movie. No, well, yeah. And they wonder why they got nothing to wear. So what is a timeless basic? The word timeless means not affected by the passage of time or changes in fashion, meaning that an item should be able to stand and test the time and still be cool 30 years from now. An example of a timeless item would be like a well-tailored suit, a black t-shirt, or a blue pair of jeans. Something that was cool 80 years ago and it's still cool today. Now basic in a fashion sense is something that is simple and unobtrusive. An example of this would be like a white t-shirt or a black jacket, not a graphic tee. Now, when you combine the two, then you can create any outfit your heart desires. And even if you want to add a more flamboyant piece and throw that on top, it's still gonna work. Now that we understand what they are, let's get to the items that you actually need to build a timeless wardrobe. So firstly, you want an array of black and white t-shirts. Ideally, you'll want some slim fit ones for your more sophisticated outfits. And then if you're a more streetwear guy, you can get your relaxed fit ones. The best place to get these are obviously Uniqlo. Uniqlo is the go for t-shirts. Next, you'll want to pair up blue denim jeans with no f***ing holes, all right? This is in 2017. You're not Kanye West. I'm just joking, not really. A well fitting pair of denim jeans is something that everyone should have is this casual staple in your wardrobe. This is something that you only typically need to replace two to three times in your life. So get one that you really like and one that's great quality. Places to buy jeans or Levi's, costs, Zara, Arquette, Gap, places like that. Next, you'll want a pair of black pants because these are the most versatile pants in your wardrobe. Get something that has belt loops and not a drawstring. So if you ever want to tuck in your shirt and throw in a belt, you'll have a much cleaner look. And if you decide to style it casually, it doesn't matter because you're not gonna see them. For getting nice black pants, I suggest looking at River Island or Zara. They've got some really nice cuts for pants. And the last pair of pants you'll need is a cream or khaki pair of pants, especially now that we are in the fall season. These are the colors to be wearing. Once again, you can get all of these pants at the exact same place that I mentioned last time. Moving upwards, you'll 100% need a white, crisp Oxford shirt because at one point in your life, you're gonna have to take off that stupid hoodie and you're gonna dress up. That being said, it doesn't hurt to have a more relaxed fit one in your arsenal as well so that you can layer over a tank top in the summer months. And in terms of where to find it, every single store in the world has white Oxford shirts. Just find one that you like and that fits well. Now, since we're talking about the more dressy side of things, You'll also need a polo because you're not always going to be able to wear a long sleeve or it's gonna be a bit too hot in terms of What style to get I really like the ones from Abercrombie the sweater polos. I just love their designs I think they just look so much better. They're not as old-manish as well. Now moving on to sweaters You'll definitely need a knit sweater or a wool sweater These look so much better than your typical crew neck sweaters and come in an array of different textures Which makes it that perfect layer to throw underneath to elevate your outfit in terms of where to buy the best knits I find abracombie's got really good ones and our kids also has some really nice wool pieces as well now as for a hoodie I would say that the best colors you go for is gray and in terms of fit I really like the drop shoulder with a slight crop places I buy my hoodies from our abracombie, but there's plenty other places you can get gray hoodies from it just depends on the style That you like now as for jackets you'll definitely want two black jackets You want one puffer so when it gets really cold and the nips are hard af you can throw that on and it's gonna warm Second, you'll need a more dapper looking jacket so that you can throw that out with your more sophisticated outfits. Things like maybe a black bomber jacket or a wool over shirt like this one. For these types of items, I find Zara and River Island have a really nice selection. You also want a nice overcoat, whether it's black, gray, or beige, the overcoat is an absolute essential staple for looking fashionable in the colder months. Now on to shoes, my favorite part. You need a pair of white leather sneakers. And if you don't have a pair of white leather sneakers, unsubscribe to my channel, dog. What are you doing? I'm just joking, don't do that. But if you haven't already subscribed, please subscribe to the channel. I love to hit 100K by the end of the year. That would be the best way to end off the year. I'd really appreciate it. Like I was saying, white leather sneakers are an absolute essential. You've got so many different choices. You've got the Reebok Club Cs, Air Force Ones, New Balance 550, Stan Smith, or even Common Projects if you're ballin' out. Second, you'll need at least one pair of dress shoes. Whether you go for a tan one or a black one depends on what type of color you tend to wear. If your suits are blue, then you go for a tan one, but if your suits are black, obviously the black one is the best choice. And that's all the essentials that you need to build a timeless wardrobe. And now, once you have that foundation, you can get some of your more trendy items and you can throw that all in together to create your own style and you'll always look good."

        "transcript": " Everyone wants to be successful. Everyone wants to be happy. Everyone wants to have lots of money. So why doesn't everyone have those things? What separates you from the person that has those things? Habits. Everyone has habits. 90% of what you do is automatic from the way that you lay down at night to the order in which you brush your teeth down to what time you take a dump. But none of those habits have much impact on the progression to your dream life. So what habits do? So what I'm about to share with you guys are the five most impactful habits I've created for myself which made me a much happier successful individual. I'm not a multi-millionaire by any means yet But I did go from a year ago working a warehouse job making 36k a year to being now a full-time Content creator six xing my income and just being in a much better place now So I hope some of this is gonna be useful for you guys So the first habit which I do every single morning is actually a gratitude tool and I learned this from Alex Hormozzi Only within the last year and it's been the most profound thing I have ever implemented into my life And what it's called is the grandfather perspective. Before we even get into this, I just want you to imagine what it would be like at 85 years old. What you would look like, how you would feel, how your body would move, what the world would look like. Now once you've got that picture in your mind, I want you to give that 85 year old self an opportunity to come back into his current body today. Now all of a sudden I get an opportunity to go back years. And now I'm in Brandon's 22 year old body and I look down and I'm like, holy shit! I am in fantastic shape. I can see, I can hear, my family, my parents are still alive. Look at the world. There's no flying cars around here. People are still talking to each other. We're not in the metaverse. And you see just that little switch in perspective. All of a sudden you get to experience things a completely different way. Because before, as your 85 year old self, it was a lack of these things. It was a lack of mobility. It was a lack of health. It was a lack of family. Now all of a sudden you got this abundance of it every single morning. and it just creates a whole different experience and appreciation for the way that things are right now. Now the second habit that I do that has completely changed my life is planning out my day than night before. The way I used to go about my day, it was like, I'm sure a lot of you guys would be familiar with. There's no structure at all. It would just be, I kind of have a vague idea of what I wanted to do for the day. There would be no time restriction. It would just be, okay, I think I need to do this next. And the problem with that was, is I would end up forgetting some of the important things that I needed to do. or I would end up spending time wasted thinking about what I needed to do next. Now what I do is I just take a few minutes at the end of my work day to plan out my entire day. So this way the next day, I'm not wasting any brain power trying to make decisions. But the way that I structure it is also very important. I actually put time restriction in because you guys have all had this experience before. I'll give you guys a story. I remember back in high school, they would allot me an entire month to finish a project and your boy would wait until the last night to finish the entire project, which I was allotted a month to do. And I would somehow, by God's grace, finish it within a night. How is that possible? Because as humans, if we are given a certain amount of time, we will stretch out that work to fill up that entire time. All you need to do is just condense the time. And I'm not just saying to do this with your tasks, because I do challenge you guys to try this with your tasks. Try to set yourself a time limit to complete things in. And then if you don't finish it within the time, you have to move on to the next thing, because there has to be a consequence as well. But not only that, I want to challenge you guys to do that with your goals. If you guys have set goals for yourself that are two years out, try to condense it into one because I guarantee you, you use this tool and you only allot yourself a certain time, you will complete all of those things that you wanted to do within a shorter timeframe, getting you to the life that you want much quicker. Now the third habit that has seriously improved my life is prioritizing my sleep schedule. So the most impactful thing I started doing was I started going to bed at the same time every night, which is 8.30 PM. You're probably thinking, Holy shit, 8.30 PM, why do you go to bed so early? And it's because I wake up at four. So in order for me to get a good amount of sleep, I gotta go to bed at 8.30. Second thing I do is I don't go on devices at least an hour before bedtime. So what I do is I just place my phone way across the room so I don't have any temptation to start scrolling on it. And in the meantime before bed, I'll either just read a book, a journal, or I'll pray. Third thing I do is I take 400 milligrams of magnesium because I've actually been proven to improve your sleep quality and help with recovery and things like that. So just getting a solid seven hours of sleep essentially makes you a superhuman in today's day and age because everybody is sleep deprived. So you'd essentially have a massive advantage over other people because they're relying on stimulants to operate in which you would just be relying on your sleep. And then if you want to take stimulants as well, then you're like foam, super power crazy. Now the fourth habit I have is I'm constantly learning. If by the end of the day I haven't learned something new, I consider the day a failure because if I only did what I do every single day, I'm going to get the exact same results. I'm gonna be in the exact same position. So every day I try to learn something new because at least that way, even if it's such a minuscule thing, I've still at least gotten 1% better because being stagnant is the worst thing in the world. So at least this way, learning one new thing, I can guarantee that I'm getting 1% better every day. And the fifth habit I have is constantly questioning whether my beliefs are my own. It's really interesting because a lot of the things that we believe are our beliefs are the byproduct of other people. Think about it. adapt the beliefs of our parents or adapt the beliefs of our friends. We all have very similar opinions on things, interestingly enough. We have the same opinions on politics, we have the same opinions on rich people or poor people or what people can achieve. Why is that? It's because we are all influenced by each other. So it's a real reality check when you start asking yourself, is this my actual opinion? Do I really believe this? Or is this somebody else's opinion that I've just learned to believe? I really think it's super important to ask that question. What do I believe? because we get so jaded and move further and further away from our authentic self. So when I make a statement, I always ask myself, do I really believe this or is this coming from somewhere else? So guys, I hope you enjoyed today's video. If you found this type of video really beneficial, please let me know in the comment section below and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " In this box, there are five items. Five clothing items from a clothing brand that used to be considered the most hated retailer in the US. But out of nowhere, the brand decided to have a rebrand in 2017 and have now become one of the most popular brands in the world, Abercombe and Fitch. I have no idea why I made that intro so dramatic, but it was pretty good. But anyways, let's see what the best pieces are to buy from Abercombe right now. First of all, we have the beautiful, essential popover hoodie, which is constantly going on sale. So don't feel the need to buy this at full price. It will go on sale at some point But this is literally the best hoodie I have found to date It has the drop shoulder which I look for in a lot of my hoodies the fit is also slightly boxy Which gives that street wear look they have a huge selection of different colors and the softness Softness like this is literally what I imagine hugging a cloud would feel like it's literally so fucking soft Next up we have the varsity bomber jacket in the navy blue made from faux wool and this thing is super heavy and thick like In a good way it is a bit on the expensive side But the quality feels a one and it also has this big B on the front for Brandon Of course because I'm such a legend they would put it on the front. No, it sounds from Brooklyn Unfortunately not nearly as cool and on the inside it's got this nylon lining which makes it really comfortable on the skin So if you just want to rock a t-shirt underneath you totally can without getting all itchy But they've also added enough room in the sleeve So if you wanted to wear an oversized hoodie underneath you could do so as well now this one here is the wash Effect crew sweater in this awesome wash green colorway This is what you call a waffle knit sweater because it's got this unique square knit I definitely needed to go a size bigger on this one because if I take this and I throw it in the wash one time I'll be wearing a crop top so do not buy your size actually size up on this one if you're gonna get it But other than that, this is an awesome statement sweater. I absolutely love this wash green colorway It honestly makes it a lot more versatile than having a bright green color. It's really just a nice casual piece next up We have the loose utility pants definitely more on the trendy side of things these come in this great colorway And as the name implies it is loose So there is a lot of leg room in here and it gives that straight silhouette as far as the utility comes I have no idea where the utility comes from. I tried sticking my M4 in my pocket couldn't even fit Unless the lines on the knees give it utility I have no idea where the utility comes from All right, chill out. It's just an airsoft rifle. But nonetheless, these pants definitely look pretty cool and are popular in the street wear realm. Now this one is very similar to the other crew neck, except it is a different knit pattern. And this one is called the Oversize Garment Di-Crew Sweater. Once again, it comes with this slight drop shoulder. And this one is so much softer on the skin than the other one. And it comes in this beautiful wash gray colorway, which honestly in person kind of looks a little bit blue. It almost looks like a light blue color in person. And lengthwise, it probably would be a bit too long if I had gone with my actual size, but I decided to size down because this is an oversized piece. So if you want it to lay the way that it is on me, just go with size down on this one. So those are my top five picks from Abercombe. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you did, enjoy this.

        "transcript": " Guys, I finally did it. I got spawned. I think you know where this is going and as much as I'd like it to be true It's not As I was going to say I went to Zara and I absolutely made it rain in there And I picked up what I think are the top items to buy at Zara right now And as you guys know I know you guys a lot because I don't put links to items and the reason is is because a lot of the Clothes I own are from older collections. So today I made a video so that you can purchase them today First item we got the double faced wool jacket. And I know what you're thinking, that looks way too fricking immaculate to be from Zara. There's no way you bought that there. Well, at least that's what I thought when I saw it on the site. But here's the thing, this isn't just any Zara piece. This is from the Zara Origins Collection, which is their luxury line. And the price reflects that because this is a $219 Canadian jacket. And I know it seems like a lot of money, but here's the thing, it's a double faced wool jacket that looks like that. For reference, here's essentially the exact same jacket from Ami Paris, and they're selling it for fucking $1300. $290 is a steal in comparison to that. The fit is absolutely perfect. The stitching is great. It's literally the most amazing fall jacket, which you can confidently pull out year after year because this piece looks immaculate and is timeless. I love this jacket so much that I went and bought two colors. Second up, we have the soft crew neck, and there is a reason why it's called the soft crew neck. I didn't actually just make that up and call it the soft crew neck. What's it called? It is so unbelievably soft that I started using it as a towel to dry my hair If you guys watch my channel, you'll understand the joke But apart from being soft the fit is pretty slim Which makes it perfect to throw under any jacket like the wool jacket flannel jackets varsities or bombers It will be a really nice underlayer for those colder days But if you want to style it as is it's got that kind of preppy look too which you can just style that with some Jewelry third we got the textured wash pants and I get so many questions about these ones and whether I got them tailored or not and No, these come like this surprisingly what you see is what you get they come in this really nice wash cream color It's extremely versatile and it's got the perfect cut in my opinion style these multiple times on my Instagram and my tiktok So if you guys want some style inspo you can go ahead over there after the video fourth We got the puffer vest and this is my go-to layer when I'm wearing a crew neck or a hoodie It just adds a little bit more to the outfit. You know what I mean? A little bit more. You guys probably have no idea what I mean. Got these little draw strings on the bottom here that you can cinch to give the puffer a more cropped look which I look for in a lot of my puffers because a lot of the time the puffers are too long and I like giving it that cropped look so I can expose the layer from whatever I'm wearing underneath whether it's my crew neck or my hoodie. I just like having that little extra layer to add some more elevation to my outfit. Are you guys enjoying this? Are you enjoying this type of style video? If you guys are enjoying it, please let me know in the comment section and like this video, and I'll keep doing more of these. The fifth item, we got the Slim Fit Cropped Denim Jeans. These are a gift from God for us short guys. With our midget legs, the crop really helps so we don't need to get things hemmed. And these ones here come in this beautifully washed blue dye which I think gives them a far better look than a lot of those solid washes. And in terms of quality, denim is denim. I've never really felt the difference between luxury denim versus a regular denim. I find them all to be the same. So the main thing I look for is the washes and the actual style of the pants themselves, which I find Zara does a really good job at having great options there. Next, we have this sweater, which is called the textured sweater. Go figure. It's got these distinct ribs that give this nice texture and fit-wise, again, it's more on the slim side, baking in a perfect item to be layered on top of. This is where I take something like my puffer vest and I throw this on top just to give this outfit a more elevated look. And the seventh item, we have a plaid over shirt in this beautiful blue and cream color. And as you can see my Arnold size biceps are starting to burst out the seams. Probably should have got a bigger size on this one. But apart from it being too small for my big biceps, it looks awesome. It's super soft on the skin and lengthwise it's not too long either. Definitely a solid piece for you guys to add to your fall wardrobe. I hope you enjoyed today's video. If you enjoyed the pieces I shared with you today and you'll be getting any of them, drop a comment, like the video, subscribe and I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " So I've been requested to do a Q&A today. A lot of you guys haven't seen a Q&A for me in a long time. If you were a previous OG from the old channel, you would have seen it, but today we're gonna be doing another one and I've picked some interesting questions here that I haven't answered before. So let's get right to it. Okay, so first I'm just gonna bang off the low hanging fruit. So my name is Brandon Balfour, if you didn't already know. I was born in the UK in the United Kingdom. You woke up, Walt, my ass! So I actually moved to Canada when I was two years old so I didn't pick up the British accent I would have been a lot sexier unfortunately that didn't happen. I'm 5'8 I weigh about 148 pounds and my nationalities is I'm British like I told you I'm Danish I'm Chinese and I'm Portuguese as well, which a lot of people don't know all right first question is what is your chest size damn Dude, I have no idea. Let's see. Oh Boys I'd say like a solid maybe C cup almost I was hanging out with Arnold the other day And he's like dude you look like me when I was in my prime. And I'm like I know. Alright next question, from where do you buy your clothes? So like I always mention I buy my clothes from Abercombe, Zara, Uniqlo. Is there another place that I buy my clothes from? Club Monaco. Yeah that's about it. Those are the four main places that I shop at sometimes. I'll go to other places online just depending on the items that I get. But for most of the clothes that I purchase, like I said, it's those four there. Who influenced you into becoming a fashion influencer? That's a really good question. I don't know if anybody actually influenced me into becoming one, but to show me that it was a possibility to be one and do this as a full-time thing has to be like Alex Costa and Jose Zaniga. They just showed me that this was a possible full-time position. But since the beginning of time, like since I came out my mom's... I was wearing a tailored suit. I came out looking like James Bond. Why are you so cute? Thanks, babe. No, that's jokes. I don't know, man. You gotta ask my mom and my dad. It's all them. It's just genetics, bro. I appreciate the compliment, though. Your favorite YouTuber. I actually really do enjoy watching a guy named Mike Thurston. He's a fitness influencer. He's a British dude. Absolutely jacked. This man is an absolute stud. He's like six foot something. Frickin' chisel looks like he came out of like a Greek god Caesar's palace or something like that. He's insane and he's fricking hilarious too. So I'd say Mike Thurston, shout out to him. He's a really good YouTuber. Next question is what is my job? So my job is this. I do this full time. Well not YouTube. YouTube doesn't pay me anything cause we're still a very small channel. but if you wanna help the channel grow, like the video, subscribe, that'll help. But I get paid mostly from doing my TikTok and Instagram stuff, so basically for transparency, I get paid through Collab. So when somebody says that, look Brandon, we want you to promote this product, it'll give me a certain amount of money. And if I do like the product and I'm like, yeah, I think this would be beneficial to my followers, then I'll promote it and then that's how I get paid. So I do that full time. What keeps you motivated daily? So I don't actually operate out of motivation because motivation is not a constant thing. It's not one thing that just goes like this, that's linear. It's one of those things that goes up and down all the time for me. So some days I wake up, I don't have a lot of motivation, but I still end up doing the work, and there's days that I feel really motivated and it's just even better. So the way that I operate is out of discipline, and that's just because I have goals that I wanna hit for my life. And if I don't do the things that I need to do daily in order to do that, then I'm not gonna be happy with what I've achieved. I don't wanna be at the end of my life and be like, I didn't end up achieving the things that I wanted to do because I was lazy. So being lazy is not an option for me. It's just pure discipline to get me to do the things that I need to do every day. How long did it take for you to transform your body? So my current physique has taken me five years of consistent working out for about five to six days a week. I don't take any supplements apart from taking caffeine. As you guys know, I'm a caffeine addict. I'm like, I do need it because I go to the gym so early in the morning. But apart from that, my physique has been built off of a good diet and working out consistently, training, hypertrophy. How much do you bench and squat? So I bench around 295 to 300 pounds and I haven't been training legs in a while because my legs were getting too thick and I couldn't fit in pants anymore and I have to get my pants tailored already so it's even extra money I gotta pay to get it done. So I haven't squat in a while but when I was squatting and training legs I was probably hitting about 405 for about two reps. How do you wake up so early? So guys, I have a extremely strict sleep schedule. I go to bed at the same time every night regardless of what day it is. If it's a Saturday night, Sunday night, I still go to bed at 8.30 PM and then I wake up at four and I've been doing this for the past two years now. So it's just this constant cycle of doing this every day that's allowed me to, you know, get used to it. Eventually you just get used to it for doing it for so long. And all my friends know that Brandon goes to bed at 8.30. So if I want to hang out with him, I have to hang out with him at five, which is nice. And they go out after they go to the clubs and stuff. But I know that if I were to go and do that, that it would mess me up for an entire week or that puts me behind on my goals, which I'm not willing to do. My school average, my school average was pretty decent because I cheated a lot. But it was also extremely easy to pass those classes. My school was so easy. Like the barrier of entry to get into honors was so low. Even though it was an 80% average, everybody in the class was hitting honors. That's how easy it was. So I wasn't any like super bright kid. I'm sure if I went to a more difficult school, I probably would have got C pluses. And that was just because I knew that none of the stuff that I was learning was going to be useful to me later in life. I just didn't care enough to actually try in school. So got poor grades, essentially. What's your favorite go-to meal for when cutting or bulking? You see, I've never done a cut or a bulk because I don't actually care to get much bigger or to get any leaner. I'm like happy with where I'm at. I still go to the gym every day, but that's just a discipline thing. It's not because I'm trying to get bigger. It's just I'm going there to move my body. Just going through the motions. It's a habit for me just like brushing my teeth. But if we're talking about a cheat meal, my favorite cheat meal is a place called Emilio Fanati's, which is here in Vancouver. Not sure if they have it anywhere else in the world, but they got the most fire pizza I've ever had in my life. But apart from that, I like Pizza Hut pizza as well with some hot wings. It's always a good choice for a cheat meal. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend, I'm single and because I choose to be, I literally don't have any time. Like if I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna spend some of the time with my family or my friends. I don't have time for a girlfriend right now. It's just one of those things that I'm not really willing to commit a bunch of time to. I'm trying to create something big for myself now and I know that I'll have plenty more options once I've established myself anyways. I'm 22 and it's not really a big priority for me in my life right now favorite movie Harry Potter series is Absolutely fantastic all those movies were freaking good, but the best movie I've ever watched probably the Goblet of Fire I love that movie with the dragons and the shark and stuff is nuts movie I've watched it so many times and I still enjoy it every time around what split do you use in the gym? So I do a push pull legs split actually I haven't been training legs like I said So it's actually push pull then full body and push pull again, and I've been working out five days a week now So cut it down so I have a bit more rest. How big is it? Let me check Pretty sure this is what you're talking about. I'm size 10 pretty average size. I guess maybe I don't know you let me know if that's big What camera do you use so my camera is an a7c sony and I have a 28 to 70 millimeter f2.8 Sigma lens what inspired you to start YouTube tick-tock Instagram ps love your style and content Thank you, brother. What inspired me to do it was this I have always loved clothes I've always enjoyed looking good and I knew there's so many other people out there that do as well And would like to if they don't feel that they already do dress well, and I was just like well Why not share my experience? I've always wanted to be a youtuber this would be a really easy way for me to do what I love to do and then help a ton of people So that's why I started and thankfully it's worked out really well because I'm living the dream now And the last question I'll answer here is what is your ultimate goal? Holy smokes, that's a big question I think the ultimate goal for everybody is just to be happy and to enjoy what they're doing and to only do things that they want to do and not do any of the things that they don't want to do. As long as you are living that and that is the life that I want to live, just do the things that I want to do and not the things that I don't want to do, then I would say that's a pretty successful life. One other thing that I do want to do is I want to make as much money as possible, not for the reason that you're thinking, I do obviously want to buy a nice car and buy a home and stuff, but there's going to be a certain level where the money you can buy whatever you want and then it's no longer enjoyable anymore and what I really want to do is just give away as much money as I possibly can. I think that's just the way that we should operate instead of trying to make as much money as possible Why not give away as much money as possible? That's what success should be measured by so my goal is just to be able to give away a ton of money in order for me to Make that impact that I want to make I need to make as much money as possible So guys, I hope you enjoyed today's Q&A if you enjoyed it Please smash that like button hit that subscribe button and I'll catch you guys in the next video.

        "transcript": " I almost died making this video. I'm literally drenched right now. Holy smokes. Yes boys today We are talking about fall essentials and yes, I did film this in the middle of the summer with no AC Because I am trying to become a saint and get you guys ready for fall our first essential is brown sneakers Well, well brown anything actually this is the time of year that we all dress up as a mr. Hank I'm Mr. Frankie the Christmas Boo. Brown and brown, it comes from you. I don't know why I used to watch that shit, but I watched that back in like, great eight. So anyway, some brown sneaker options you got. You got the Jordan 1 Mocas on the more expensive side. Don't expect everybody to purchase that, but New Balance has an array of brown sneakers. I was looking at it the other day and I couldn't believe how many different brown sneakers there are on the New Balance website. So I would say start there, look at New Balance, but if you want any more options, go onto SockX and just look up Brown Shoes And again, you're gonna find a list full of brown sneakers. So the second essential you're gonna need is some cream and brown pants, surprise, surprise. Two very versatile colors, which I talked about in my previous video. In terms of what style that I've been rocking recently, I've been wearing the work wear because I wanna feel like a man. I wanna feel like I can just build a house in two seconds with my hammer. Oh! Oh! But realistically, these pants give you that street wear rugged aesthetic, which I really like. So I've been trying these out, but realistically, just get yourself a pair of cream brown pants that does not matter the style. Third thing, flannel jacket. This is the epitome of fall and white girls. Every girl in their flannels, their lululemon pants, their uggs, fuzzy socks. As I was saying, flannel jacket is definitely something that you want in your wardrobe. It's a perfect layer that's gonna elevate your outfit while keeping you warm. And the fourth essential is a vest. And this is probably the easiest way to upgrade an outfit without adding too much warmth to your body. You know, you have those cut off sleeves and it really goes with anything. You can put them over a hoodie, you can put them over a long sleeve, you can put them over a t-shirt. It really just works with everything and it just makes your outfit look a little bit more complicated, more unique, it's an essential. Now our next one is very similar to the vest, except it has arms, which is the puffer jacket. Now this one obviously is gonna come in mad clutch when the nips can cut through fucking glass, but it's also going to make you look massive. Like literally, you could probably stand next to see bum on stage and potentially win. Skinny bitch. Jokes aside, the puffer jacket is the perfect layer to keep you warm, as well as give you that street style look, which is mega popular. Number six is an overcoat. You just can't have enough of these. They look so elegant and it's an easy way to make people think you actually know how to dress. It's as easy as throwing this coat on and then instantly you've grown a few hairs on your ball sack and your IQ has gone up significantly. And number seven, Master Ugue is gonna be a bit upset about this one, cause I've been using his people. There is no good or bad. The turtleneck. That is bad news. It's one of the most versatile base layers. It goes under everything. Literally anything. It can go under a crew neck. It can go under a vest. It can go under a puffer. It can go under an overcoat. I don't even know how many more pieces there are. There's a ton. And especially if you wanna give yourself a more sophisticated look, turn on that because definitely the go-to to achieve that style. Same with the next item on our list, which is pleated pants. It adds a sophisticated preppy touch with those clean pleat lines. It makes you look taller too for all my short kinks. But overall, it's just a really nice change up from just wearing denim or chinos all the time. And number nine, we got knit socks. For obvious reasons because it's cozy I really think it is time that we move away from wearing Nike socks with every single outfit and shoe And we move to something that's a little bit more minimalistic has no logos And then the texture adds that premium look to the sock and number 10 you can find this essential if you just scroll down on the video Yeah, right there that is the like button and the subscribe button is right beside that So if we please hit both of those things if you haven't already I would really appreciate it and I'll catch you guys in the next video See you"

        "transcript": " So you've already got blue jeans and you got some black pants. What else could you possibly need to look good? Well, let's just find out because you're missing about five. So these trousers are called the Isimiyaki pleated trousers coming in at $400 minus the zero because these ones are actually from Zara and I'm a broke boy. So these are the broke boy Isimiyaki pants. They got this very distinct texture that looks extremely elegant. It looks like you're balling out of control if you're rocking these. I'm telling you this is going to take your style game to the next level. And if you're a guy that doesn't like to wear a ton of colors, this can work as your statement piece. You don't really need to use anything other than these pants. Of course, obviously throwing a shirt, but what I'm saying is that you don't need to over complicate this fit. The pants work as a statement piece on its own, so even just wearing a plain tee on top is gonna look really good. Next up, I'll probably regret saying this in a few years, because I definitely wouldn't have said this a few years ago. And the next pants on the list are cargo pants. So I decided to get out of my comfort zone, purchase myself a pair of cargoes. I'm fairly late on this trend, but you know what? It actually looks pretty decent and especially if you're a Jordan guy or you love your sneakers These are the type of pants you want to wear those really chunky sneakers So if you're into that street wear aesthetic get yourself a pair of cargoes definitely a good street pants because you can store Lots of drugs and stuff in it because go lots of pockets now This is the pleat trouser and before you guys start roasting me about these just look at how good this freaking fit looks bro And the reason I bought these pants is because they see a lot of people in Asia wearing these in the street fashion scene It honestly looks so sick and I'm so excited to start wearing these now because I think I can actually pull it off And it's really nice though because you can take that preppy look But then you can start to dress it down make it a little bit more casual by adding like Oversized tees or even certain coats and stuff that can look really good as well. It doesn't need to be super preppy That's a nice thing about these pleated trousers So if you haven't tried pleated trousers before try it out I'm telling you you're gonna see me wearing these a lot and you'll have plenty of ways to style it because I'll have all my Pictures on instant now as we transition into the fall one of the main colors to go for is brown So you're gonna need yourself a pair of brown pants and no particular style this time Just get something that's obviously versatile enough that you can wear with multiple different outfits and realistically You can find brown pants anywhere the ones that I'm wearing here are from Abercrombie But you can literally go to any store and you're gonna find multiple pairs of brown pants now The next pair is also neutral which is cream or off-white denim. These are absolutely perfect This is probably the most essential pants on this list if you don't already have it It just goes so well with everything else any color that you want to throw on it's gonna go absolutely perfectly with So if you're trying to get into brighter colors get yourself a pair of cream pants But even if you want to go for a monochromatic look obviously you could just go with that full cream look It's just a very opulent color and I think it just works with everything and finally We have the pinstripe or plaid pants and kind of like those easy Miyake ones We were talking about earlier with the fake ones from Zara these kind of act as their own statement piece You don't need to over complicate it with your upper layers All you need to do is just keep it nice and neutral and your outfit is gonna look like it took some time to put together So if you're somebody that doesn't have a lot of time to throw outfits together Get yourself a pair of pinstripe or plaid trousers, and that is it guys I hope you enjoyed today's video if you really enjoyed it Please help me out by smashing that like button and sharing my content would be it nice as well And I'll catch you guys in the next video.

        "transcript": " School is only a few weeks away Just because your boy is 22 and no longer in high school doesn't mean I don't know what's popping for high school I'm gonna get you guys fresh you can just send this video over towards your mom get all the things in this video Trust me you're gonna be pulling this year. So first thing you need to switch out is your damn fragrance I swear every single dude wears the exact same fragrance. It's either your savage bliddish and alpaca roban one million Versace Arrows right if you want a chance at getting a girlfriend this year You can't smell like her brother her ex-boyfriend and her dad all at the same time you got to be a little bit unique So you want to try fragrances like Prada L'homme Versace pour homme Chanel allure homme sport au extrême 212 for men terre de Hermès mais on mon gel a jazz club Tom Ford ombre leather There's so many different unique ones that you could try other than you know the main designer fragrances that everybody's wearing Second thing is to get a better backpack and I'm not saying you got to go for a full grain leather one spend hundreds of dollars on it I'm just saying dude get something that's minimal. It's clean. That's not 150 different colors like Dora's backpack Just something that is nice and aesthetic that can go with all of your outfits So it does not distract from your outfit and keeps you looking fresh places that offer backpacks that are quite nice or like Herschel North Face Bellroy Lule lemon Nike all these places have pretty minimalistic bags So any of these will do just make sure that it's a neutral color so that it's got that versatility Good thing is to wear button-up t-shirts. This is a literal cheat code most dudes are gonna come to school They're gonna be wearing their hoodies. They're gonna be wearing their graphic T's oversized shirts like Brooke We're trying to stand out here when you pull up wearing something nice and elegant You're gonna be looking a lot different makes you look more mature as well Which girls really dig if you haven't noticed and one of my favorite combinations is just to throw a tank top underneath Roll up the sleeves show off the forearms and throw you got like one of the sexiest outfits a dude can wear Four thing you're gonna need at least one pair of white sneakers Nike Air Force ones new balance 550s Adidas So as we goes, you know, any of those shoes that are white, because of that versatility, that's what this whole video is about. You want versatile pieces that you can wear on a daily basis. Fifth thing, go get your mom to take you to Uniqlo. And if you're in college, you can go by yourself, but I don't judge if your mom is still taking you to Uniqlo. Get yourself white t-shirts, black t-shirts, and gray t-shirts. These are gonna be the base for almost all of your outfits. So it's good to go here, because they're like $22. They fit nicely, they're good quality. And you know, you can always just replace them throughout the year, because it's not super expensive. So Uniqlo is the place to go. Sixth thing, you're gonna need some jeans. So you want to get a blue pair of jeans for obvious reasons. A blue pair of jeans is just essential. Then you're also gonna need a pair of black pants. Typically where I buy mine from are from Zara and especially if you're a shorter guy, they got cropped versions, which is an absolute blessing, I think. The Zara lords for that one. And they're a pretty affordable price for pants. You know, you're paying like $45 for it in Canadian, so probably about $35 US. And the seventh thing is a pair of sweatpants and not the usual pair of sweatpants. These more elegant looking ones. These are called pleated sweatpants or pleated joggers. These just look obviously way more elegant. You can still look casual, you can still be comfortable, but at least this way, you're actually gonna look a little bit more put together rather than just wearing a regular pair of sweatpants. So I bought these ones from Express. But there's lots of other companies that sell them if you just look up pleated sweatpants, you'll find them. And the eighth thing is to subscribe to the freaking channel, boys. We're at like 7K, what is going on? We need to get this thing popping, let's go boys.

I'm in phenomenal shape. But to be fair, when I was younger, I was very insecure about my height, which led me to ingrain my mind with the ancient scriptures of high delusion into my brain. So basically, I'm an expert on appearing taller than I really am. Let me explain how to do it. So high delusion has mostly to do with the colors you wear and the style of the garment that you choose. So most people know it seems like it's pretty common knowledge that you gotta keep your colors congruent with each other if you wanna look the tallest. You don't want to add a bunch of contrast into your outfits cause it's gonna cut you in half. So monochromatic fits are always the best. Everybody knows that. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Gets a little bit trickier though when it comes to what styles you should choose for your pants because lengthening your legs is actually what's going to make you look the tallest. So you wanna avoid anything that's baggy, first of all. That's the main thing. You want your pants to have no break whatsoever. So it's just a streamlined straight leg. And then you want to avoid anything that is too wide as well because it's gonna make you appear wider than you are and shorten your appearance. You wanna be slim and slender. So the best cuts to choose are gonna be slim fit and tapered fits. Another trick that is incredibly useful is using vertical lines into your outfits. As you can see here, I'm wearing a pair of sweatpants that has a pleat line, that vertical line that is going straight up my legs. And to the right here, I have a regular pair of sweatpants that don't have that. And as you can see, that vertical line actually makes a difference in lengthening in my legs. Makes me look quite a lot taller. So you don't only have to use this in your pants, you can also use that vertical line strategy when it comes to your upper fits as well, because it'll do the exact same thing. It's just gonna lengthen the overall appearance of your body. Now, as for shorts, you guys are gonna know what I'm gonna say if you'd watched my previous video on shorts, if you haven't watched it, go back and watch a dog. What are you doing? So if you're a shorter guy, you wanna be wearing five inch shorts. And if that's a little bit too short for you, six inch. Anything over seven to nine is going to be way too long and it's really going to shorten the appearance of your leg. So anything above your knee is really going to be the golden area for you in terms of lengthening out your overall proportion. The next trick is for your shirts and you wanna make sure your shirts fall at mid-fly. So mid-fly is exactly the way it sounds. It's in the middle of your fly. Any longer, if you're going past your crotch, is obviously gonna make your legs look super stubby. So you wanna make sure it falls around this point and typically you're not gonna find shirts that fall exactly in that range. What I do is I take mine to the tailors and I just get her to hem it up a bit and it makes the overall outfit look way better. Not even just make you look taller but it actually makes the shirt look like it fits you a lot nicer as well. And the other alternative to that is just to tuck it in and it's gonna give you the same appearance. It's just going to raise that waistline now that you can actually see where it is, rather than when you have your shirt, you have no idea where that line is. And the next trick is so you can save money on your pants so you don't have to go and get a tailored, and that's to go and buy cropped pants. So cropped pants are just pants that have been slightly cut higher than the normal level. And for a short guys, it's honestly wonderful because I can put them on and they're gonna fit like exactly the way I want it, because the regular cut is actually gonna be too long for me and I always have to get those hem. So when you get the crop fit, it's literally gonna fit perfectly most of the time and you never have to pay for a tailor. Hope this video helped you guys out.

        "transcript": " I avoided shorts for years and that's why if you go back onto my old channel and you scroll through you won't find a single video on this topic. Reason why is just because I thought it would always look like this. And that was true. I always did look like this. I'm until recently. That is why today I'm gonna show you guys how to style them and not look like a quote-unquote idiot. Starting with the most important part to not look like an idiot and that is your length. Please do not go past your knees. This was the main reason I stopped wearing shorts was because I didn't know where to buy shorts that weren't below the knee. But now we got places like ASOS, Zara, Abercrombie. They've all got really nice lengths that are typically above that seven inch range. So seven inches and shorter is going to be your golden zone. Just take a look at this here. On the right side, this would be your stereotypical nine inch. These aren't actually nine inch shorts. I'm just sagging hella hard. And on the left hand side, you'll see these are a seven inch shorts. And look at the difference. One absolutely dwarfs your ass, making your legs look super stubby. And the other one looks quite a lot better. So if you're like me though, and you got really short legs, the seven inch is practically the same size This is my leg. So I always go for five inches and that's gonna give you kind of the same result as somebody who would wear seven inches, but it's actually, you know, around six feet. Now that the basic housekeeping has been cleared up, let's style some of these. So right here, I have this awesome green and white striped shorts from Zara. As you can see, it's actually knitted, which creates that really amazing texture. Now when you're wearing shorts that are striped like this, which is quite prominent, you wanna wear something above that's not going to distract. You want your shorts kind of to be your statement piece. So as you can see here, I just went with this oversize plain white texture tee and it just makes those shorts stand out. And then for the shoes, I just finished it off with the Air Forces. Next up, I've got these lightweight six inch shorts from Abercrombie in black and these are much easier to style because it's black. So this time I decided to go with this Abercrombie Chicago Bulls tank top, add a little pop of color with the red and then I added another pop of color with my Converse CDGs with that little red heart as well. Now these shorts here are a pair of khaki shorts and these are probably the best choice of shorts if you're trying to go for a more dress up occasion. They're essentially chinos that are just cut to a quarter of the length. So on top, I've gone with the Zara Campcaller T and I've added these great white leather sneakers to finish off the look. Next up, I have these striped cream shorts from Abercombe and because the stripe on this one is so subtle, I'm actually going to add this blue striped relax fit button down for this kind of breezy summer fit vibe. Now, this next pair is a pair of sweatshorts, and as these give off the kind of lazy, comfy vibes, I decided to continue that with my upper piece. So I added this Relax 49ers graphic tee that just fits the overall aesthetic perfectly, and I decided to add my Nike Dunk Sale light bones to finish it off. And this next one is actually something to wear to the beach, and as you could probably tell, these are quite short. And yes, they are very short. These are a three inches, and I decided to kind of test out the waters on this one, because they're three inches, and I'm not sure if my nuts are gonna hang out the side, but I've been training legs super hard, which is why I purchased them, and I think they look pretty good. So with this fit, I've gone with the tank top and layered over top with this linen long sleeve, which looks really clean, and the shoes that I'm wearing are the Greats White Indie Leather Sneaker. For the last fit, these shorts are the same black Aberconby linen ones that I mentioned earlier, but I've added a plain white oversized tee from Uniqlo, and then I've layered on top with this amazing green Varsity jacket from Nova Men plus the new balance 550s and this is kind of an outfit You're obviously not gonna wear on a hot summer day. This is something you're gonna wear in the evening So that was my guide on how to style shorts if you guys enjoyed today's video Please smash that like button hit that subscribe button, and I'll catch you guys in the next video See ya"

        "transcript": " Alright today, I'm gonna be showing you guys my entire sneaker collection Yeah, so I'll grab my first sneaker to start this beautiful shoe right here. This is the Nike Sakai LD waffle nylon white It's just a really unique looking shoe It's got this double sole to Nike tics two tongues as well boost my height by like two inches was just pretty sick But it's also just like a really unique looking shoe, which is the reason why I like it so much You know when I bought this I was thinking I'm like yeah, nobody's gonna have this until this day I mean I've seen it on social media, but in person I haven't seen anybody wearing these so it makes me feel quite special Now this sneaker right here is a really high quality leather sneaker from a company called greats This silhouette kind of reminds me of the Alexander McQueen, but a little less ugly, you know, it's not as thick But it's still got that chunky aesthetic It's the high quality leather made in Italy got that back heel tab almost the same as Alexander McQueen's too So realistically these are very similar shoe except I like the silhouette better on this one It's a little bit more sleek and not nearly as expensive either which is a plus and these next sneakers right here also from greats as well Same company as that last shoe, but clearly this silhouette is very different on this one This is a got that dad shoe aesthetic and when I first got told that I was gonna get sent these I was like yo, those are gonna look mad goofy But when I put them on feet I was like dude These are actually kind of nice and they've grown on me a lot and now they've become one of my favorite sneakers in my collection Okay, this next one a lot of you guys are probably gonna start laughing and think like what the hell's going on brownies Are the Jerusalem? 2000s Jesus used to wear these back in the day clearly his fashion sense was already there use a way ahead of his time Yeah, I purchased these actually because I saw it on a model in a Zara picture And I was actually look really good on him and obviously these are a little bit more appropriate to wear to a dinner occasion if you want like that open-toe option which is why I purchased these I'm like I'm not gonna go to a restaurant wearing slides is a little bit more appropriate and I think it looks pretty good you guys probably think it looks whack but it's my style so I like it now this sneaker is from a company called Express it's honestly a fantastic looking sneaker I just love the colorway it's got black white a bit of cream though this really goes with a lot of my outfits the one thing I will say with this shoe though is it's it's terrible quality it's got the same quality as those H&M shoes that you buy for $40. It lasts you two months and then they're just destroyed and you gotta buy another pair. So that being said, it's a good looking sneaker. All my sneakers are white anyways, so realistically the lifetime of them aren't very long. All right, next up we have the New Balance 550s and these are definitely my most worn shoe in my collection and they practically look brand new because New Balance actually makes good quality shoes and like a lot of the other brands. It's honestly just such a clean sneaker and the fact that the New Balance 550s are kind of the new wave, it brings a little bit more vibrance to the shoe rather than just always wearing Air Forces. The new Balance 550's gray shoe, I wanna get a bunch more. I just haven't gotten to it yet. All right, so these special shoes right here, these are the Nike Dunk low light bones. This is actually a woman's sneaker. I had to purchase these in size and a half up for it to actually fit my foot, but I don't know why they don't sell this in men's cause it's the nicest colorway that I've seen in the dunks. It's got this rosy sole here, a gray and cream on it. And I actually switched out these laces. These used to be gray, but now they're cream. Cause I think it just looks way better than Nike should have sold it like this anyway. But yeah, typically wear these with a lot of my streetwear fits, same with the new balances. These are just one of the cleanest sneakers to wear when it comes to streetwear fits. Now these bad boys right here, these are the oldest in my collection. And the reason I think they've lasted that long is because they're the only black shoe I own. You can't really tell that they've been demolished. I've had these since the beginning of my channel. The only high top I have actually, and they're just so nice. I love the come to gar song collab. And so if you guys are looking for Converse Chuck Taylor, I definitely recommend spending a little bit more money, get the come to Garcon version because it's quite a lot more high quality than the regular Converse truck dealers. The last white sneaker I have is the Reboc Club C85s in this white and navy colorway. I actually received these for an Amazon collab that I was doing and then now I find myself wearing these a lot more often than my Air Force ones just because everybody wears Air Force ones. So I would say like this is the best alternative and they're only about $85 too, which is relatively cheaper, a sneaker that looks this good. So guys, that is my sneaker collection.

        "transcript": " So this is an interview that I did back in 1981. And I know it looked a little bit different. My girlfriend had just broken up with me at the time. So things were a little bit rough. And anyways, back to the story. As you can see, just behind me over there. No, no, not there. It's my ex-girlfriend, you a-hole. I still haven't gotten over her. Over there. Yes, that. You see, right there, that was my first ever computer. Pretty crazy considering now. Have this 2021 M1 Max MacBook Pro. And not only will I be showing you guys this Macbook Pro be showing you guys the rest of my setup All right, that's enough steep jobs. Okay. Let's actually do the tour now So like I said my main machine for this setup is the Macbook Pro M1 Max 2021 It's got two terabytes of SSD, 32 gigabytes of unified memory, and it's a 24 core GPU. This thing is insanely fast. It absolutely just smashes through my work. I have no wait times for practically anything other than the render, which is still extremely small in comparison to my last computer. It was honestly just the perfect editing laptop for me, and plus it's 14 inches too, so I can take it wherever I go and I don't have to worry about carrying a big bulky 16 inch MacBook. And as you can tell, this doesn't look like the normal Macbook colorway, and that's because I've added a D brand marble skin, not only to protect it, but it also goes quite nicely with my setup. And underneath the Macbook is a Besine LSX3 aluminum laptop stand that just looks nice and elegant. It allows for more room on the desk, so it's not so cluttered. And it also allows me now to use my Macbook as a second monitor so I can drag things right across the screen and it's in line with my monitor. And speaking of the monitor, this is an LG UltraWide CB99 34 inch curved monitor. Like I said in my last video, this thing is absolutely insane. It's got gorgeous images. The color is very close to the Apple screen and is freaking massive. It makes the workflow of my editing much easier. It allows me to extend my timeline all the way across this amazing screen. It also charges my MacBook at the same time, which is a massive plus. And holding this humongous screen is a Vivo monitor desk mount, just the single arm. This thing looks fantastic, once again keeps everything off my desk, which allows me for more room for other things like this Tyotronix Bluetooth 5.0 speaker. This is honestly such a good little speaker, costs like 50 bucks and it does everything I needed to do. It's plenty loud, has decent bass, it just packs such a good punch for like 55 dollars. Next thing on my desk is my Apple Magic Keyboard, nothing super fancy, does exactly what it's It's supposed to do. The one thing I would say with an Apple Magic Keyboard is these things have insane battery life. I've charged it probably five times in the three year ownership that I've had of it. It's actually insane. Now moving on to my mouse, this is the Logitech G305 in the white colorway. Again, keeping it consistent with the whole color scheme I got going on here. It's the perfect size mouse to just throw in your bag with the Magic Keyboard and take your setup and just go. And underneath the mouse and keyboard is this Camu XXL Gaming Mousepad. It's extremely soft and comfortable to rest my wrists on. Gives me plenty of room to move my mouse around if I wanna hit some dirty flick shots and see us go. And it also helps with the aesthetic of this setup because it gives that contrast to the desk. And speaking of the desk, this is a sit stand desk that uses Anthra Desk Electric Legs. It's paired with an IKEA LeCaptain 63 inch tabletop. I absolutely love this setup. The 63 inch tabletop from IKEA is the perfect length so I can fit everything on my desk comfortably without any cramming. I ain't gonna lie though, I spend most of my time sitting down because I'm lazy. I don't really stand too often, so maybe it wasn't the best purchase, but it is what it is. And underneath the desk, I've done some fine cable management. If I'd like to say so myself, kinda reminds me of the Mona Lisa a bit. Do this, I just used some double-sided tape and some zap straps, and she's done. Looks nice and clean. And now onto some of the little accessories I have on my desk that don't do too much. I have this anchor wireless charger that I use every once in a while, throw my phone on there, just to quickly charge it, or I can also throw on my air pause as well, just nice and convenient. And next to that, I have this Amazon black pen organizer, more just for decoration, I have a few pens in there. And then next to that, I have an Ikea plant, so I just don't look like a psychopath, because I know my setup is very minimalistic. And the final piece of the setup is my chair, which is just an Ikea chair, it's nothing special once again, it doesn't have crazy lumber abilities, It's just a freaking chair where I tend to hunch over anyways. So yeah guys, that is my setup. I hope you guys enjoyed today's video. If you enjoyed it, please smash that like button, hit that subscribe button. I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " How many times have you found yourself getting so excited to purchase that special item you've been saving up for? You're constantly looking at the tracking code, looking in the mail every day hoping that it's going to be there, and finally it comes, and oddly enough the excitement starts to fade. You use it one or two times, and then you find it two years later and your claws are full of dust. Even worse, you have to sell it to some asshole who practically steals it from you because you prefer the money over it sitting there. So how can we stop making these impulsive decisions? A wise man once said, a stupid person never learns, a smart person learns from their mistakes, and a wise person learns from the mistakes of others. In this case, you guys are the wise. And I will be showing you guys all of the purchases that I have made that have been absolutely incredible. Things that I use on a daily basis, which were well worth the amount of money that I paid for it. So hopefully maybe you guys can enjoy these things as well. So the first thing that was well worth the purchase was my jewelry collection. And it's probably worth around $4,000, mostly consisting of sterling silver, which we know is a very durable material. So in terms of how long this is gonna last, let's just say it's most likely gonna last me, the next generation after that, and then the one after that as well. But the real reason this was well worth the money is because jewelry literally transforms your outfit. Without jewelry, your outfit looks basic. To this day, I've literally never left the house without at least a massive gold Cuban Jain on. So if you don't have any jewelry, it's probably one of the best investments you can do in terms of like a style investment. Now the second thing is this fine piece of tech you see right here. This is my LG Curved Ultra Wide 4K Monitor. This has a price tag of around $1,300. Or at least when I bought it, that's how much it cost. And was definitely the best decision I've ever made in terms of technology purchase. The amount of screen real estate this thing has is absolutely obscene and it tremendously increases the rate at which I complete these videos that you guys watch. This is literally an editor's white dream. I can stretch my timeline all the way across my screen. I can see everything, every single frame. It's just so nice. And just because you're not an editor doesn't mean this isn't for you either. I would say that this is perfect for everybody. If you're a student, you know, you're doing some research on one side, you're writing your essay on the other, you can split the screen, you have two pieces there. Or even if you just work from home, this is just, it's so nice to have the extra screen real estate if you wanna be more productive and that sort of thing. Third item is my Bose QC45 headphones. So I purchased these around four months ago and I probably wear them about 70% of the day. I wear them to the gym, I wear them when editing, I wear them when reading, I even wear them when I go swimming. Okay, the swimming thing's obviously jokes. Like I said, I wear these about 70% of the time and the main reason I bought these was because of how comfortable they are. Literally says it in the name QC45 meaning quiet comfort. I've literally never thought that damn, I feel like there's a hydraulic press crushing my head right now. I can sleep with them on and totally forget that they're on my head. And my most favorite part about these headphones is the noise canceling. You can get rid of all the really annoying noises. Brandon! Brandon! Brandon! I'm joking, I love my mom. But my mom does work from home all day long. She doesn't have an office door, so throughout the day, all you hear is this. You were going to be there in half an hour. Um, okay, we kissed, um... So when I want to focus, it's practically impossible. But when I throw these things on, the noise just seems to like completely disappear. I can't hear anything. Fourth thing is my coach, Cart Holder. I've probably had this thing for about four years now looks almost as new as the day that I purchased it and it gets thrown on practically every Surface no-demand constant abrasion with my keys and it's literally handled it like a champ coach Obviously isn't the cheapest, but it's also not the most expensive either like you got your brands like LV Where you're gonna get the exact same quality, but you're gonna spend you know five times the price plus your kidney And I ain't got no kidneys to hand out I need my so coach is that perfect middle ground where you don't pay too much for the brand name But you're still gonna get that high quality durable leather that's gonna last you a really long time Fifth thing is books and this is gonna have to be like a completely separate video because there's so much to cover when it comes to books Things that have learned from books is literally part of the reason why I have been able to achieve what I have in the past You know two years they expand your mind to the possibilities of what's capable Constantly question your beliefs teach you about the woman's private parts and most importantly helps you become the more evolved version of yourself This is by far the best decision I've ever made was purchasing that first book because I've ended up turning into this. The sixth item is my Cologne collection. How can you be a stud if you don't smell like a stud? Aside from completely changing your appearance, your scent is probably the one thing that's gonna give you an extra three points on the attractiveness scale. You could be the worst looking dude in the world, but put on an absolutely bangin' cologne and you're automatically more attractive. So having a great scent is so important. Once you find one that you really like, kinda disregard the price. I mean unless it's like ridiculous amounts of money, but typically ones that are a hundred to two hundred dollars are well worth it because they last you Quite a few months and you obviously gonna become more attractive to the opposite gender The seventh thing is this camera that I'm recording on right now This is a Sony a7c with a Sigma 20 to 70 millimeter f 2.8 lens whole setup being around $4,500 and due to my job. This is obviously the most important piece of equipment without this crispy video and the perfect images my only fans wouldn't be popping Some of you definitely were just like oh shit I'm pulling up to it right now But this camera has literally transformed my Instagram feed increased the quality of my videos Which has increased the amount of collaborations I get so investing in this camera and my lens has literally made me Quite a lot of money, so I really appreciate you camera. You're absolutely amazing So if you guys enjoyed today's video please smash that like button, hit that subscribe button. And I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya!"

        "transcript": " About 70 million people in the United States suffer from sleep disorders every year. So that means if the entire US population is 329.5 million, 21% of those people are having a hard time falling asleep. That's a serious problem. So let's try to fix that. First thing you can do to optimize your sleep is to work out first thing in the morning. Studies have shown that early exercises spend the most time in the deepest, most anabolic stages of sleep versus people who exercise later on in the day. And here's the cool part for all of you that are like, Brian waking up at 5am to go to the gym to work out for an hour and a half. No, you don't even have to. You actually only have to work out five minutes. That's the crazy part. Five minutes. And you will actually gain the same benefits as somebody that goes to the gym for an hour and a half. So you can literally jump up and down in your room, walk around your house, do a little high intensity training session for five minutes. What it does is it creates a short term adrenaline response which will improve your sleep rhythms and it tells your body to create more melatonin earlier on in the evening and it's also going to significantly improve your mood. The same thing is to keep your damn devices out of your room at least two hours before bed. But if you can't help but to be on your phone right before bedtime, at least put it on night mode or wear a blue light blocking glasses because any blue light exposure before bedtime is going to suppress your melatonin production, thus not making you very tired. Third thing is creating an optimal room temperature for you to fall asleep. The best bedroom temperature for a comfortable sleep is approximately 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3 degrees Celsius. So really anywhere between 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit is going to be the best and the most comfortable for you to fall asleep. Fourth thing is to stick to a sleep schedule. This is really difficult for a lot of people, but this is probably one of the most important things, actually. You want to make sure that you're going to bed at the same time every night and waking up at the same time every day because we are creatures of habit and it's really difficult for people to keep adjusting their sleep patterns. It takes a toll on your body. So one of the best pieces of advice I can give you is literally set an alarm for your bedtime. I know you set an alarm for when you wake up. not many people set an alarm for the bedtime. And this is just going to ensure that you're not like staying up too late and being like, oh, I was distracted. So now I'm going to bed. Oh, it's like 11 PM now. And I was trying to go to bed at eight. So you won't have an excuse. And that is going to make sure that you're going to go to bed at the same time every day. Fifth thing is to drink an absolutely massive energy drink right before bedtime. This is probably the best thing that you can do to get I'm f***ing around. Obviously caffeine is not something you want to be taking before bed. So you actually want to cut off your caffeine and take at least eight hours before bedtime because that's how long it can stay in your system for. So if you wanna go to bed at 10 p.m., you should be cutting off your caffeine and take before two because having it later than that is going to block your production of the hormones that you need to sleep. And number six is to relax before bedtime. Have a consistent wind down routine that you started the same time every night so that your body prepares for sleep. Take a bath, read a book, listen to some soft music. Do whatever makes you feel at peace but make sure that you do this every night so it gets your body prepared. I absolutely have some amazing wet dreams. And the seventh thing is to get some sunlight. Daylight is imperative to maintaining regular sleep patterns. So if you can try to get outside at least 30 minutes throughout the day, this is going to significantly improve your energy throughout the day. And it's going to help you fall asleep later on. I know it's difficult. I spend most of my time here in the basement where I get no light whatsoever. So I try every single day to get out for at least 30 minutes. So guys, I've just cured insomnia.

        "transcript": " So I do a push pull leg split which is transform my body from this to this in five years. Pretty insignificant right? Yeah, I agree. But you guys asked for it so I'm gonna tell you anyways. So this is a week of me in the gym. Let's do this. Alright Monday is push day baby. So we started off with peck fly machine. It's got these titties juicy. I do about two light sets of 12 to 15 reps. And then I move on to two working sets with heavier weight keeping it in that 10 to 12 rep range. Next, I move on to incline dumbbell press where I just ripped the chest off the bone with four sets, progressively getting heavier and then a massive drop set till failure on each one. Now at this point, the titties are double d's. Now onto shoulders, starting with a superset, including a frontal raise for 10, a lateral raise for 10, and some rear delt flies for 10, totaling 30 reps for one set. Next, I go into triceps and once again, supersetting weighted dips with some tricep extensions, normally going till failure on every set for about four times. And that concludes Monday. Tuesday is a pull day, and I normally start with around 60 wide grip pull-ups just to get my back pumped, get some blood flow in there. And then I move on to a superset consisting of underhand lat pull downs with pullovers progressively getting heavier, and I do this for four sets. Next I move on to the seated row machine and bang out four working sets plus a drop set at the end. And finally, I do a bicep superset consisting of hammer curls with the easy bar curls, and I do four sets and all of these sets are going to a failure. Wednesday is leg day. I start off with some really, I just throw the bar on my back and I do 70 reps and this really gets the blood flow going. If you guys haven't done this before, it actually is already difficult with no weight. Once I do that, I start moving up in weight and I do four sets and then once I get to my top weight, I go to failure and then I do a massive drop set all the way down, all going to failure and all of those as well. Next, I move on to the leg extension machine where I go straight to working weight and do 10 fast reps followed by 10 three second negatives. for a total of 20 reps, and I do this for four sets. Next, I move on to the hamstring curl machine where I do four sets of 12, and the last one being a drop set. And lastly, I do calf raises on the leg press machine till failure for four sets. Thursday, we're back on a push day, starting with a decline press this time on the hammer strength. I do two sets of lightweight just to get the blood flow moving, and then I move on to working sets of 10 to 15 reps for about four more sets. Next, I move on to the cables, and I do two sets of flies from each angle, starting from the top, then the middle, then the bottom, and I do that for a total of six sets. And after that, I still stay on the cable machine and I do single arm cable flies on an angle to hit the rear delts and superset this with lateral dumbbell raises as well for about four sets. After that, I move on to some heavy skull crushers, superset with closed grip bench, four sets, and doing about eight to 10 reps on both. Friday, we're back on pole day. I start off with the lat pull down with a wide grip and I do two warm-up sets, and then I do four working sets Consisting of 10 to 12 reps then I move on to the V bar rose and I do four sets of 10 to 12 reps finishing with a Massive drop set on the final one for that I'll move on to pull-ups and I'll just do four sets of failure to finish off my back next I move on to the bicep machine where I do 10 fast reps and 10 with a three second negative for a total of 20 reps And I do this for four sets and finally I finish off with some hammer curls for three sets of 10 reps And that is it if you enjoyed today's video Please smash that like button hit that subscribe button, and I'll catch you guys in the next video See ya"

        "transcript": " Incidents of acne have been documented for over 4,000 years, dating back all the way to the ancient Egyptians. And what they believed is acne was caused by Lyme. So either all of us from mother f***ing tires, or somebody was lying to their kid, trying to stop them from lyme. Either way, we now know that acne is caused by lots of different factors. And that is why today I'm going to give you guys a complete guide on how to create your own skincare routine, specifically designed for your skin. Now the first step to every good skincare routine is a cleanser for your face. And it's important to know that not every product is going to be meant for your skin. Some are meant for combination, some are meant for oily skin, some are meant for dry skin. So the way that you figure out what type of skin type you have is just by first thing in the morning, wash your face with water and then don't apply anything else to your face for the rest of the day. You'll find out pretty quick what skin type you have. If your face gets really shiny and all oily, you obviously know you have oily skin. Vice versa, if your skin gets really dry and tight, you've got dry skin and if you get a little bit of both, you have dry cheeks and a oily T zone, that means you have combination skin. Now that you've figured out your skin type, then you can select your cleanser, and most of the time, if you look on the bottle, it's gonna be right on the front labeled as for what type of skin it treats. Because if you get the opposite of your skin type, it can really make things worse and make you break out a lot more. Now the second step is a facial toner, and this is something that I've implemented into my skincare routine in the past six months, and I've noticed a significant difference in my skin. So a toner is essentially a water-based liquid that's normally infused with some skin-smoothing ingredients like eucalyptus, peppermint, or even aloe. And the toner's job is meant to gently refresh your skin without stripping out its natural moisture. And the toner also prepares your skin to just drink up the post cleansing moisturizer and any of those other treatments that you're going to apply it later on. The third step is a serum, which is definitely not an essential, but it does help a lot. There are all sorts of different serums that you can get specific to your goals, like skin brightening serums, hydrating serums, feet free radical fighting serums, acne prone and sensitive skin serums, Reparative texture improvement serum the one you choose really just comes down to what goals you have if you want improvement in your skin's texture You would obviously get the skin texture one or if you have lack of hydration You would get those stem number four is an eye cream again This is not an essential but it definitely does help if you don't want some crusty ass eyes when you're older And it's also a very useful option for people who have dark circles typically eye cream has vitamin C in it Which has been proven to enhance the brightness of your skin and also help repair the skin tissue as well step number five is to Moisturize which I'm sure we all know what a moisturizer is it just helps moisturize your skin this tends to be an area of confusion for a lot of people Especially people with oily skin because they're like dude. I don't need a moisturizer my skin's already so oily It's gonna make it even more oily Normally the reason why your skin is actually really oily is just because it's not adequately hydrated meaning that once you actually Moisturize your skin it's gonna produce a lot less oil So a moisturizer is definitely essential for every skin type and once again guys with all of these products Make sure that you're buying it for your skin type Don't buy anything else. That's not because it's literally gonna make you break out way worse and the last step Which is definitely the most crucial Typically, this is something that you're gonna worry during the daytime unless where you live the sun never goes down Which is sunscreen now take a look at this picture this lady literally applied sunscreen to half of her face for her whole life And nothing to the other. I have no idea why she would do this or how much the person paid her to do this But this is so stupid, but clearly you can see that one side of her face has been horrendously aged more than the other So I really don't think I need to explain it more than just showing you this picture because I'm sure you're absolutely Mortified you're never not gonna wear an SPF again.

        "transcript": " Alright last week I dropped an absolute banger of a video on summer style tips Now some of you that watch that video kind of understand how to formulate an outfit when it comes to actually making it You're shooting blanks like your 99 year old granddad So that is why I've created 10 sexy ass outfits that are practically guaranteed to get you laid It's definitely a promise I can't keep but you're gonna be pretty undeniable Alright for our first outfit I'm wearing this really cool textured knit camp color tee from Zara over top of this ribbed white tank top. As you guys know it's literally my favorite way to layer is using tank tops which you'll see a lot in these other outfits. So moving down to the shorts I'm wearing these khaki 5 inch inseam shorts from Good Threads to keep that monochromatic look and then finish it off with some really beat Air Force ones. The second outfit I wanted to keep nice and simple but also elevated at the same time so I threw on this extremely elegant textured oversized tee from Zara which is definitely my favorite t-shirt I own now and I paired these with five inch striped Zara shorts which I think the green in these shorts makes it really pop it makes it all come together so nicely and I've also added this minimalistic Zara side bag which adds a little bit more dimension to the fit because it is simplistic but adding these little extra accessories is gonna make that outfit really pop. And for the shoes, I'm wearing a pair of Nike Sakai Nylon White, my newest addition to the collection. For this fit, I've layered it with a beautiful Zara Light Green linen t-shirt over top of the tank top, of course, and I paired it with some Abercombe mesh shorts. And I've actually never owned a pair of mesh shorts up until now, but I can totally see the appeal on these, especially for the summertime. It's got amazing breathability, it's light, and it's definitely in style right now. And for the shoes, I'm wearing the New Balance 550s white and gray. Fourth outfit is a bit more dressed up than the rest. This is my go-to look for a summer dinner occasion. I'm wearing a Massimo Duity, something like that, that's how you pronounce it. Linen, a long sleeve over top of a tank. Paired with these gray drawstring Zara pants, they're extremely lightweight too, so it's actually not adding much heat to my body at all. And these definitely make the outfit look a lot more dapper just because of the way that they've actually cut these. And for the shoes, I'm wearing these with a really comfortable pair of sneakers from Greats called the McCarron Blanco. Now this one is very similar to the previous one, but a bit more relaxed, maybe like a picnic or beach occasion. I'm wearing this with a relaxed fit Ralph Lauren dress shirt over top of a tank, paired with some lightweight linen Zara pants. I just love the overall aesthetic of this entire outfit. Kind of reminds me of the 90s vibes a little bit. And for the shoes, I'm wearing these beige express sneakers. Now this one would obviously be for a cooler night. Maybe you're going to like a drive-in movie or something similar to that where it's outdoors. I'm wearing this awesome royal blue and yellow varsity bomber from Zara over top of a tank top. This jacket has to be probably my favorite varsity I have. And you guys know I have a lot of varsity jackets, but this royal blue one, I just think it looks so nice. Now moving down, I'm wearing some light blue slim crop jeans from Zara as well, paired with the great indie white leather sneaker. For the seventh fit, I've gone with another simplistic but elevated look by using this really cool ribbed oversized t-shirt from Zara. Partially everything I have on this list is gonna be from Zara, by the way. So the texture on this shirt just makes it look so opulent. It makes it look more expensive. I paired this with some comfy sweatshorts from Fashion Nova Men and I'm wearing my Nike Sakai LD Waffles again. This look here is a tad bit more flamboyant and out there. So if you're into graphic tees and patterns, it's a really sweet way to combine them together. I'm wearing this white graphic tee from Tommy Hilfiger paired with these blue floral shorts that I found at the thrift store. and then I went with the Air Force ones to finish it off. This ninth outfit, you'll see a lot of people wearing this in Europe. It's not typical to see this in North America, but definitely in places like France and England and Germany. I'm wearing a Relax Fit Uniclo tee paired with these plaid Totman pants, which totally completes the look. I'm also wearing a hat with my Zara side bag and the Greats White Leather Sneakers once again. Final outfit, I went with one of my favorite color combos, black, white, and blue. Paired this with a black floral camp color tee over top of the tank. I also added a Zara bag with this fit and the Zara light blue jeans as well. And then again, I've added the grates, white leather sneakers, cause it's such a versatile shoe.

        "transcript": " This is my dad, that is my brother, and that is me. What do both my brother and I have in common in this photo? We both dress like my 55 year old father. So in today's video, I'm gonna teach you guys how to not look like your 55 year old father this summer from experience. So obviously, color choice is going to play an important role in how cool you feel. You don't wanna wear dark colors, you're gonna attract the sun like a magnet, almost like how I attract these bills on these streets. Dicking to your lightest colors is gonna be the smartest choice, and if you really wanna get fashionable and unique, You want to start adding some brighter colors and patterns, especially if you're trying to stand out the shirts with the flowers stripes and the palm trees Such a vibe now certain fabrics you choose are gonna allow your skin to breathe more than others unless you're trying to cut weight So you can smash up McGregor You're gonna want to choose lightweight materials like cottons linens chambray and rayon as these are going to allow the most airflow Now that we're past all the boring stuff the way to make your outfit look better is to layer over tank tops This is literally my favorite way to make a summer outfit look better because it allows you to get that layered effect without Adding too much heat to your body. Next is shorts There's a very fine line between what makes you look like a slob and what makes you look good and that line is located Right above your knee so anything below this line is gonna make you look like you're going to play basketball with Shaq So typically I tend to go for five inch in-scenes because my legs are quite short So it allows me to show off the quads a little bit and increase the appearance of my height But some people aren't into that dandals area and look like I am so the seven inch shorts will be just as good Especially if your taller seven inch shorts are still going to be nice and short It's not gonna be too long for you now Accessorizing because obviously not the time to layer in the summertime You can actually add more accessories than you usually would because this is going to add some dimension to your outfit Add more rings layer the necklaces add a side bag sunglasses hats Look at how massive of a difference it makes when adding all of this to a basic outfit No extra heat, but a lot of extra drip. Next thing is your socks choice. Now I do think when wearing shorts, the longer socks in combination with your sneakers just looks the best. But that being said, when it is so blazing hot that you go outside for five seconds and you get a tan, you're gonna look really stupid when you pull down your socks and you just go up this massive farmer tan that goes halfway up your calf. So for those days when it's extremely hot like that, I would just say go with the no-shows. Even though it doesn't look as good, I would just go with the low cut sneaker and the no-shows So you don't have that stupid tan line on your legs But if it's not as hot always go with the long socks and the sneakers beautiful combination and number seven is your choice of fragrance and I know this isn't gonna make you look more attractive but gonna make you Overall a more attractive person if you smell good So you need to choose the right fragrance because you don't just throw on any fragrance during the summertime You want to choose fragrances that are citrusy things that are fresh fruity Don't want to be wearing your winter fragrances because all that extra heat is just going to make it too overwhelming and it's gonna defer people rather than attract them.

        "transcript": " In today's video we'll be sharing with you guys the hottest sneakers to wear this summer categorized into three different tiers Our first tier is the budget friendly tier, which is up to a hundred and ten dollars US our mid tier Which is up to two hundred fifty dollars and lastly the sell your right nut tier up to six hundred dollars Starting off on the more affordable end of our scale for a hundred and ten dollars and under we have the adidas Ozelia coming in at ninety three dollars now some of you guys are sneakerheads you may realize that this looks practically the same as the Yeezy 700 Wave Runner, like almost identical. Except one's gonna cost your kidney and the other you get to keep your kidney. So if you're into that futuristic Yeezy concept, this is a really good alternative for a quarter of the price of the Wave Runners. Next up are the Reebok Club C85. Priced at $74, this is a great slim minimalistic sneaker. I could see these being used as an everyday sneaker that will go with various styles from a more streetwear look or even when you want to get a little bit more dressed up because they're just a nice slim, minimalistic sneaker. Now obviously I have to mention the Air Force ones because if I don't people are gonna be in the comment section and be like, but I didn't wear the Air Force ones, wear the Air Force ones, Air Force ones are the best. This is by far the most common shoe for people our age and for good reason. It's got that perfect balance between minimalism, it's white and it's also got that chunky aesthetic which is now in for a lot of sneakers. Next we have the Converse Chuck Taylor's Lowe's or High's classic silhouette that's been around since your dad was born. So this ain't going anywhere. It's gonna be around for a while and plus it always looks good with straight fit pants which is in style right now. And our last sneaker in the budget friendly tier is the Vans Old Schools coming in at $65. These are just the perfect beaders. Everybody knows these shoes. I used to wear these back in high school when I'd go to parties and when I'd go to campfires. These are just the perfect everyday shoe that you don't really need to care too much about. Now moving on to our mid tier which is up to $250 now. We're gonna start it off with the new Balance 550s. These things are so clean. They have that vintage look to them and they come in copious colorways as well. I would say that these are really giving the Nike Dunks a run for their money because a lot of people are on the new balance wave right now. Now that being said, the Nike Dunks are our next sneaker because these are extremely popular as well. I have a pair of these. And you can get some really good colorways for under $250. There are a lot that are over, but some of the ones that are underneath that $250 mark are perfect as well. Next up, we have your Oliver Cabello, which is essentially your affordable white leather Italian made sneaker. These are made with top notch quality leather. As you'll see on their website, they even break down the materials they use. So they're using the best Italian leather, but for a fraction of the price of some of the other ones that we're gonna mention later on in this video. Now for an open toe option, so you can see how good you guys' grooming is. See if you guys have actually been watching the video. Here's the Yeezy Slides. These are so popular right now. Typically they're gonna be worn with socks. Apparently they're extremely comfortable. If you've got friends that have them, they tell me that they're comfortable. I personally don't own a pair, so I don't know. But they say that it's super comfortable, I'm just gonna trust them. Now the last ones for the mid tier is the Nike Blazer mid 77 a massively popular shoe just an all-round Great-looking high-top a pain in the ass to take off and on but it is a very versatile Now the sell your body parts to afford them tier the next shoe on this list is my favorite Which is the axle arigato ace a shoe these look so nice and they come in the coolest colorways in my opinion Probably the nicest silhouette I've ever seen. Next we got the common projects a very nice minimal white leather Sneaker made in Italy very similar to the Oliver Cabela's that I mentioned earlier except this one is almost triple the price I literally included this one just in case you guys had a ton of money And you're like I prefer to get the more expensive one So this is an option but I'd say that Oliver Cabela's is a way better bang for your buck So I thought I'd include a Jordan one because I know a lot of you guys do like the Jordan ones and that is the University blue Jordan ones. I think this blue colorway is probably my favorite out of all of them And it's the most appropriate for summer due to its mostly baby blue and white counterparts And lastly is the Nike Sakai LD waffles or even the vapor waffles These are really unique looking due to the odd shaped soles retail for these is much cheaper But once again resale value of these cost pretty penny But if you guys really want to look unique this summer these sneakers will get a lot of head turns They just look super cool. She made it to the end of the video So if you guys enjoyed this sneaker video, please smash that like button hit that subscribe button I'll catch you guys in the next video. See ya"

        "transcript": " So now after trying out an enormous amount of hacks due to TikTok, I'd like to think of myself as some sort of life hack guru. So today I'm gonna share with you seven out of the 100 hacks that I've tried that are actually useful that I use pretty consistently. So let's do this. Starting off with my favorite one of all time which received a whopping 24 million views on TikTok. It's a special way to fold your pants to make it shorter, but without making it look like it's been rolled 100 times. So the way you do this is by grabbing each side of your pants at the height that you want it to be cropped at. And then while holding the sides, you wanna roll up the excess fabric underneath until the only thing left is that little stitched area. Now take the stitched bit and then roll it over top of the crease you made to secure it and boom! Works like a charm and it looks much cleaner than the pin roll. Life hack number two is a way to fix your overly baggy sweatpants. To do this, you're gonna need to steal two of your moms or sisters or girlfriends hair bands. Now what you wanna do is take your hair band and put it around the part of your leg where you want your sweats to stop. I recommend if you're gonna do this, wear long socks so it doesn't pull your hairs. Now you're gonna pull your sweats over top and then you're gonna feel the band through your pants and then you're going to pull that band out and tuck the excess fabric underneath the band and stop once you get to the cuff. Next hack is one that I use whenever I go shopping and that is how to check to see if your pants are gonna fit without having to put them on. So the way you do this is you wanna grab your pants like so and then you want to wrap it around your neck and then you need to scream, where are they? You don't need to say that obviously, but you can if you want to. If the two ends can meet and there's a massive gap between your neck and the pants, that means that it's going to be way too big for you. And vice versa, if the two ends don't meet each other and you have this gap in between where your pants can't connect, that means it's going to be way too small for you. And if they connect perfectly and it's nice and snug around your neck, it is going to most likely fit you. I have no idea how this works, it just has never let me down, so I just always recommend it. Now the next one is how you can get rid of these stupid ass fluff so that you always get in your sweater. All you need is your razor. No, not the ones that have your pubes all over them. A clean one. So what you're gonna do is place the garment on a flat surface and then you're gonna take your razor and gently slide it down over and over until you get rid of that pilling. Now this next one is more so you just don't look like a middle-aged man when you take off your hoodie. That is how to tie your hoodie the cool way. To do this one, you wanna fold your hoodie in half and then you're gonna throw it over your back so that one sleeve comes over your shoulder and the other is going to come underneath your armpit on the opposite side. Now bring the one that's over your shoulder towards your hip on the opposite side and grab the other one and bring it across and over and then tuck it under, bring it through like so. Now take this part and fold it upwards and bring the other sleeve and pull it over and under to make this little cocoon. Now look at how much less of a goof you look versus the other one. Now this one works really well for the times where you're running extremely late and your t-shirt looks like a grandma's ass. So if you don't have time to iron your shirt, stick your shirt on the inside door while you have a shower and the steam from your shower will actually help loosen the creases. Obviously, it's not going to be absolutely perfect, but it's better than not doing anything whatsoever. Next one is so that you can take your loose fitted pants from this to this. In order to do this one, you're gonna need a pair of scissors, you're gonna need a shoelace, and you're also going to need a pin. So what you wanna do is you want to pinch the inside of your pants about an inch away from the button, and you're gonna separate the front fabric from the back layer, because these are typically double layered, and you're gonna feel a difference. If you only feel one layer, these are not the pants to do it on, because you're gonna cut right through. But if you feel that there are two layers, this is gonna work for you. Now that you got your first layer, you're gonna take your scissors and you're gonna cut a small hole right there And you're also gonna do the same thing on the opposite side Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your shoelace and you're gonna stick the pin through the end and then you're gonna take That shoelace and you're gonna feed it all the way around the pants until you make it to the other hole Once you made it to the other side just pull up your pants tie them up Now you got drawstring pants and you never have to wear a belt If you guys found at least one new hack in this video, please smash that like button hit that subscribe button If you didn't find anything whatsoever, please do the same thing anyways"

It creates an amazing ambience Especially the ones that are the warmer lights not the white lights, but the yellow ones those ones just look so much better And then obviously you can choose different designs depending on what you want your aesthetic in your room to look like I chose an abstract one Which I thought was pretty cool now if you were a fiend for your phone You can't help but to grab it first thing in the morning one thing that I purchased which was immensely useful was this alarm clock. Not only did this increase the style of my room, because just look at how much better this looks versus having my phone there with a cord attached to it. The modern alarm clock makes my nightstand just look way more aesthetic, and it was extremely cheap too. So you can fix two problems, phone addiction in the morning, and then you also make your nightstand look more aesthetic. Next thing you can add to your floor is a nice fuzzy rug. It's gonna actually help make your room look a lot larger than it really is, and it's gonna add some contrast to your floor. And obviously, first thing in the morning, it's gonna be quite nice to stick your feet on. The next item might be more for a sneaker head or somebody that just had a lot of shoes and that is the IKEA Floating Lack Shelf. This was immensely useful for me because I have so many pairs of shoes that mostly just sit on the ground. So I thought, you know, I spent a lot of money on my shoes. Might as well get a shelf where I can actually display my favorite shoes. Show the world because that's what we spend racks on our shoes for. Speaking of shoes, our giveaway winner to these Nike Air Force Ones that I did the other weekend is Danny underscore 27.6.

Once again, this is going to help you organize all of your pieces while protecting them from getting scratched and tangled on each other. Another similar item is a ring display. And again, this just mitigates your rings chance of getting scratched and lost. Plus it looks quite elegant as well. And number eight is a nice bed frame. This can make a huge impact on the aesthetic of your room and being that there's so many different bed frames to actually choose from, you can completely change the aesthetic depending on the frame that you go for. Mine obviously being a minimal modern aesthetic. I went for this natural wood color, my Kia and it's just an Ikea mom bed. I think it was like $200. So it's not that expensive, but it can really make a difference in your room. So guys, that is the eight items that I have for you guys today.

        "transcript": " Today I'm gonna try to custom a pair of Air Force 1s and give them away just like this guy right here, Marco. I'm sure all of us have seen his extremely satisfying videos where he takes a plain Air Force 1 like this one and transforms it into something absolutely magnificent. So I have decided I'm gonna try to do the same. Key word here is try because I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm also not artistically capable whatsoever. These are my current Air Force 1s which look like they've been ragdolled down a couple flights of stairs so we're definitely gonna need to go get some new ones. We did it! We got the Air Force ones and they're actually the only ones left at the store. The only ones. There's like four different stores that I went to and JD was the only one that had them and they're in my size size 9 so that is sick. Now we gotta get our paints. And just when I thought everything was going perfect, the earliest stick can arrive is Monday, April 25th. And this video needs to drop on the 16th, which is three days from now. So I have no idea what I'm gonna do. I should have planned this earlier. So guys, I was literally just going for a drive just to clear my head, think of some new ideas for new videos. And I just remembered that about like three or four years ago, my friend and I, Thomas, we made our own customs and he actually still has those, I'm pretty sure. So I'm gonna give him a call. I'm gonna go inside and then we'll see if he answers and he's got them. I'm really hoping he's got them, please. T-LOR! Are you sleeping? Yeah. I thought you were up, bro. I texted you and then I kind of stosed off again. Oh, my bad, dude. I thought you were awake. No, it's okay. So I'm going to be filming a YouTube video. I'm doing like a custom Air Force One video, so I was wondering if I could borrow some of your paint. Yeah, you can. Is it what I'd be able to pick them up today? Yeah. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Alright, here comes the moment of truth. I'm actually really scared to do this, but we're going to put our first little bit of paint on here. Oh, you can't even see it. There you go. That's the color it's going to look like. Oh, I actually dig this color. It's nice. That's the color it's gonna look like. Ooh, yo, I actually dig this color. It's nice. Woo! The seekers are finished. about seven hours they turned out actually really nice obviously there's some areas that I messed up because I'm not a professional but to be honest it looks pretty freaking damn good and I'm excited for whoever's gonna win this speaking of the giveaway if you guys want to be entered into win this subscribe to my channel like this video and then comment giveaway in the comment section below you guys will be entered into it and I'll catch you guys in the next video peace"

        "transcript": " It's scary how easy it is to just stay the same. The same job, the same habits, same body, same excuses. One year turns into two, then three, and nothing changes. Then a video like this pops up on your YouTube feed and it makes you check in with yourself. Am I actually growing year over year? Am I doing everything that I can to become a better man, a better son, a better person every year? And the cold truth is that the majority aren't. They're stuck in this cycle and they confuse distraction with progress. They scroll through TikTok for two hours and then call it relaxing when really they're avoiding the fact that they haven't made any real moves in months. They talk about getting in shape, starting that side hustle, asking for that raise, reading more books, but somehow it's always next week. It's never right now. So why do most guys stay stuck? Because changing your life, it requires more than motivation. It takes discipline, it takes sacrifice, it takes facing hard truths about yourself that most people would rather avoid. Think about Neo and the Matrix, right? He had a choice, keep living in this illusion, which was great. Or take the red pill and face the uncomfortable truth. And most guys, they hit snooze on that red pill every single morning. And if you're feeling the same way, it could be because you're addicted to comfort. You're used to it. Let's be honest, comfort is the enemy of growth. Modern life is designed to make you feel soft. Food delivered to your door. Entertainment on demand. AI writing your homework. And then you wonder, why do I feel so unmotivated? Just look at someone like David Goggins. The man is running ultra marathons for broken feet because he knows that growth is on the the other side of that pain. He trains his mind to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. That's why he's not average. You don't grow from comfort. You grow from challenge, from pressure, from pushing your limits. And it could also be because you lack a clear mission. Let me ask you a hard question right now, and most people don't have the answer to this. If I gave you $10 million right now, tax-free, take it all. What would you do with your life? And if your answer is, like the majority of people, I don't know, that's exactly why you're stuck. When Batman begins, Bruce Wayne had a clear mission to turn that fear into strength. He needed that strength to protect his world. Everything he did from training in the mountains to building the back cave, it all had purpose. You don't need to be a superhero, all right? But you do need direction, you need purpose. Just pull out your phone and write down your purpose, your goals, work backwards from that. And by the way, I change my goals all the time. I start the year with a list of goals and then every month I realign because the world changes around you and you need to recalibrate. I've been locked in on growing my brand, Forte Series, my social media accounts, my new vlog channel about business, which I'm very excited about, all because I tuned in with my ultimate purpose, which is to reach as many guys as possible and help them find themselves. That's my purpose. That's what drives me. That's what makes this all worth it to me. Now, going through life without a clear why is how you stay average. A man with purpose, he just moves different. You know, he wakes up earlier, he trains harder, he thinks long term. I'm always making lists on my phone, figuring out better ways to achieve my goals, keeping track of my goals. And this attached to my phone is a sub case Mag Flip. This is designed to make your life more practical by combining a wallet, a phone stand, and you can even use it as a handle for your phone when you're shooting videos, whether it's videos that are vertical or horizontal, because this MagSafe magnet is crazy powerful. It's really sturdy and it grips your phone. Most guys want practicality. We want things to be easy. So combining your wallet and your phone It seems like a no-brainer, right? You put one thing in your pocket and that's it. This wallet has an RFID card to protect your information. You can fit up to five cards there. So you have your ID, debit cards, credit cards, all in one place. I like to stand for my desk. Sometimes I miss messages or notifications on my phone, but the stand makes it a lot easier to see. It's also great on the go if you wanna watch a podcast or a video at a cafe, the stand is great. And if you create content, you can use it as a tripod too. So it really is multi-use. It makes your life so much easier. Amazon reviews don't lie, right? And the sub case has 489 reviews at a 4.4 average rating. So you can feel confident that this is a great product. And look, my YouTube sponsors help me fund my team of editors, graphic designers, and I'm very grateful for them because without sponsors like sub case, I wouldn't be able to post these videos every week. So if you're looking to combine your wallet and your phone to make your life easier, check out sub case in the description. Now, one quote that I always come back to when I'm thinking about why some guys just get stuck in their progress is the famous, you are the average of the five people that you spend the most time with. Basically, you become who you hang out with, period. If your boys are sleeping in, they're partying every weekend, they laugh at self-improvement, and you're probably just like them, otherwise you wouldn't be friends, you wouldn't be hanging out with them. If your circle doesn't challenge you, you don't have a circle, you have a cage. Find people who make you wake up and feel excited, who make you level up, who ask, hey man, what books are you reading right now? You know, how's that business idea coming? What do you have going on right now in terms of work? Most guys never change because they're scared, scared to fail, scared to look dumb, scared to start from zero. But you know it's even scarier. Looking back at your life when you're 40 years old and realizing that you played it safe and that you stayed in the shallow end, that you never even tried. You know, Will Smith once said, the best things in life are on the other side of fear. And if you think that he wasn't scared the first time he walked on set of the Fresh Prince with no acting experience, you're crazy. You know, he was definitely shaking. And fear is kind of like a compass. It scares you, but it's probably the thing that you need to do. It's probably the thing that you need the most because it makes you grow. It gets you outside of your comfort zone. And something that I hear from other guys is they come up to me and say, Hey man, I have so much potential. I know what I can do. So does every guy scrolling Instagram, right? Instead of building your future, you're scrolling on Instagram. Potential is just worthless without execution. You could be the next great artist, entrepreneur, athlete, but if you're not working on it every day, you're just another guy who could have made it. You know, Michael Jordan wasn't just talented, he was obsessed with practicing and getting better and better. First in the gym, last to leave, that's how you separate yourself. And we've seen it over and over again. People with incredible talent, incredible potential. Actors, musicians, athletes who have everything in front of them and they give in to drug abuse or anything that doesn't lead them in the right path. Now, something else that's going to help you improve is something that I learned a little bit late in my life, but I'm so glad that I did. How do you expect to improve if you're not measuring anything? You track your Uber Eats delivery closer than your own habits. That's not good, right? So start small. Did I train today? Did I read something useful? Did I keep my word to myself that I was going to do A, B, or C? Imagine playing Call of Duty with no score, no objectives, no way to know if you're winning. That's your life without self-tracking. And I say Call of Duty because your man used to play a lot of Call of Duty and we always look at just the scoreboard to see where I'm at, right? You need that scoreboard. What gets measured gets improved. And some guys stay stuck because they've never gotten a taste of what it feels like to win. They've never walked into a room in great shape, looking stylish, and then felt those heads turn. They've never had a girl compliment their confidence, their hair, or their style. They've never closed a deal they thought was impossible. Because once you get a taste of progress, once you get a taste of winning, it's addicting. Get a small win, put it on the board, and then stack another. Momentum builds confidence, and then confidence changes your life. So where do you go from here? What do you do? Well, stop waiting for perfect conditions. You don't need more motivation. You don't need more content telling you to wake up at 5 a.m. Go to the cold punch sauna, all that. Just wake up 30 minutes earlier, maybe start a 30 day challenge, no junk food or no corn hub or no skipping workouts. Replace TikTok scrolling with five to 10 pages a day. That's really all you need. Put a time block on your daily calendar to push a project forward, whatever project you're working on. Your side hustle, whatever your dreams are. Put 30 minutes a day into it, that's it. You don't have to fix your entire life today. You just have to start and here's the truth. truth. You're meant to stay average. If you're watching this video to this point, up to this point, it means that you don't want to be average. You want to be better than that. That's why you're watching. There's a version of you out there in better shape, sharper, more disciplined, more respected, more fulfilled, but you have to earn that better version. It's like Captain American before the serum. He wasn't really ready for it, but he stepped up and became the man that he needed to be. Only in real life, unfortunately, we don't have a serum. So we We have to replace that serum with hard work, with discipline, with consistency. And if you watch this far, it means that you want more for yourself. Now prove it. Drop a comment below telling me one habit that you're committing to change this month. And if this video hit home, share it with a friend who needs this wake-up call. Because you know, this isn't just a video, it's your checkpoint. It's halfway through the year right now. It's the moment that you stop saying, one day, are you like, one day I'm gonna make money. One day I'm gonna be in shape. One day I'm gonna get to travel the world. I can't wait. This is that moment. Start now, and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " You know, to be successful, you don't need to wake up at 4am, you don't need to grind until your eyes bleed. That's the kind of stuff that you see on social media, but that's all for show. If you're ambitious, this video will change the way that you think about success forever. Like, I'm not lazy. As a matter of fact, I used to believe that if I just outworked everyone, if I stayed up later, if I woke up earlier, if I pushed harder, that I would win. And I thought success was about pure grind, you know? So that's what I did. I said yes to everything. I pulled all nighters all the time. I went months without a break and all it really got me was burned out. Frustrated, sleep deprived. I was working harder than ever and I still felt stuck. That's when I started to realize that maybe it's not about how hard you work. Maybe it's about what you work on because hard work caps out. The leverage, leverage scales and that changed everything for me. Let me be real with you here for a second. I know what hard work looks like. I'm an immigrant. I moved to the US from Brazil and I grew up in a community of immigrants. All hustling just to get by. I've done landscaping. I've been a bus boy, a bar back. I worked at Domino's Pizza, I worked at Subway, I even cleaned dishes at a restaurant where I was barely old enough to be in the kitchen, you know, so I'm not sitting here trying to avoid hard work. I've done it. I've felt what it's like to come home exhausted, hands dirty, back sore, and still made barely enough money to get by. So the problem is an effort, right? Because I was putting all of my effort into those jobs. The problem is when all that effort leads nowhere, when it just leads to nothing. And that's the part that no one tells you. Success isn't just about how hard you work, It's about what you work on. Some of the hardest working people I know, they're broke. I've seen guys doing construction in the middle of winter, working 12 hour days, and still living paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, I've seen guys make six figures from a laptop with way less physical effort, right? Why? Because they chose the better vehicle. They chose the better direction. It's like trying to dig a hole with your hands versus using a shovel. You can be the most determined guy in the world, scratching at the dirt. Very athletic guy, just trying to get everything out. but someone with the right tool, trouble is gonna finish the job faster. With less effort, better results, that's why choosing the right vehicle in life is so life-changing. It's not that one guy worked harder, he just worked smarter. And at some point, hard work without strategy, it just becomes wasted energy. When I started uploading videos on YouTube, I didn't have some master plan. I was just a kid, I was passionate about technology and teaching, I've always liked to teach. It's the older brother in me, just trying to figure things out, trying to help out. But once I realized that I could turn an audience into a business, that I could grow a brand and launch my own products with Forte, that was the shift for me. That's when I stopped trading my time for money and started building long-term leverage. And one thing that sped up that process was learning how to delegate once I could afford to hire more team members. For example, about a year ago I hired an executive assistant. Her name is May. She's amazing. She handles my calendar. So I'm always organized, you know, and she has full access to my emails. So she sorts through my inbox. She replies to my emails and makes my job a lot easier. I was spending so much time just sifting through emails. Now I train her to do it and I get to reallocate that time towards building forte or shooting more content, which no one else can do it for me. You know, I have to shoot my own videos, but I don't have to answer my own emails. So it made sense for me to hire May to do it. I travel a lot. I'm actually going to France later today for the 24 hour Le Mans race, which I'm really excited for. And while I'm on the go, I know she's got me covered. She's on Slack, she's answering messages for me. She's rescheduling my calls, my meetings. If I'm busy, she's always on top of it. So getting an executive assistant was one of the best decisions I've ever made because it freed up my time to work on bigger projects or to be more social if I wanna take a few days off. So I'm not burned out. So I'm not worried that an urgent email is gonna come in and I'm gonna miss it. I can rely on her. I hired May through Athena, which is a platform made to simplify delegation. They train executive assistants, then they match them with the right candidate. So they match me with May And it's been amazing to have her help me over this past year because delegation is a hack. It's about working smarter, not harder. I don't want my life to be about meetings and emails, but I want to keep growing my business. So Athena helped me do that and made books, my dinner reservations. She schedules my doctor appointments. She's trained in AI tools, so she does a lot of research for my business. Think about this way. How much more work could you do if there were two of you instead of one? That's the whole point of delegation. It's cloning parts of yourself to be able to get more done. And Athena makes it easy because their sisters, their placing are already trained. So they come in with ideas and suggestions to instantly help you. And I've had such a good experience with May that I wanted to share Athena with you guys. It's the first link in the description below. And I wanna pause here and say this. If you're still watching this video, you're already ahead of most people. That alone gives you an advantage because the truth is most people have no idea that these opportunities exist. You know, I come from a family and a community where people work brutal jobs, just because that's what they were told it was the only way to get by, to become successful. Get a job, show up early, stay late, Hope for a raise, that's the system. And if no one shows you there's another way, how are you supposed to know better? How are you supposed to win? I had to break out of that cycle. And you've been looking back now and all the books that I read, all the time that I spent just learning about American culture and law and taxes. And man, it's tough, but you can do it. I know you can't. You've seen enough content, you've read enough posts, you've watched enough videos to realize there are other ways to succeed. You don't need to work 80 hours a week, a hard labor physical job to make money. And because you know that, you owe it to yourself to act on it. That's why I don't really look at being lazy as a flaw. I think it's smart if you want more return for your effort, for your hard work. You're not trying to avoid work. You're just trying to make sure that your work actually gets you somewhere, right? Most people feel stuck and unmotivated because deep down they know that they're digging with their hands when they could use a shovel. They're burning out with no progress. So my real first breakthrough didn't really come from making millions, right? It was a good feeling. It felt nice, but it came from making my first $200 online. And I still remember that moment. I was making YouTube videos, there were gaming videos, Call of Duty at the time. And then I got a $200 check from YouTube for the month after three months of posting or something. And I was like, okay, I made $200. If that's possible, would it be possible to make $1,000 a month in a few months? And that small paycheck, $200 changed everything for me because from there, I just built. I kept making my videos better. I kept learning more about social media. I kept learning about how to make money online, how to save money from taxes. Like I just learned as much as I could. You know, I either saved what I made or I reinvested it, any of that revenue, into making more. And then I paid my bills with my other jobs, which at the time I was an EMT. I was working overnight, over time, I was working 50 to 60 hours a week minimum. And I was also a bouncer on the weekends. I was really hustling to make six, maybe $700 a week. And the funny thing is that even just by building my personal brand and learning how to build social media channel, like a YouTube channel, and make money online, I landed a job at Google. And I worked there for three years, making six figures a year. So the leverage that I built was so beneficial for me that it even offered me a great career if I wanted to pursue that. And I wish more people celebrated those early wins, you know, because replacing or adding to your income with a side hustle is a massive win. Making an extra $1,000 a month from something that you built, that's not small, that's life changing. For me, it was $200. I was like, oh, I go, I can almost pay for my car, which at the time was like $253. I remember it, $253. So I was like, damn, I can almost pay for my car. And that was a big moment for me. It's life changing. I've had big wins, I've traveled, I've hit milestones, but nothing compares to that first taste of freedom, of possibility. I just felt like the doors opened in front of me. My next big, big moment, the moment when I realized I didn't need to rely on anyone else to survive, to me it was when I quit Google to work for myself. I took a big risk, it was scary, but I knew what I had built was special and I knew that it was the right time, the right move for me. And just a side note here, because I think this is really important, I see so many people making this mistake all the time. I get so many messages from guys who tell me they're about to quit their jobs to become a content creator or to build their personal brands. Please don't. If you have a job that's paying your bills, quitting that to then start building your personal brand is the worst mistake that you can make. But Alex, isn't that what you did? No, I built my personal brand first. I built it as I worked a bunch of nine to five jobs. The analogy I like to give is, you know, when Tarzan is swinging through the forest, you know, he's on the vines, don't let go of one vine before you gripped the next one. You know, you should know if the next vine is stable or not because if you just let go, you might not find the other one, it might not work and you might fall. It's a much bigger risk than checking the next vine first. Okay, this one's good and then letting go. So do even like posting content, right? It's one thing to post a couple of videos a week. It's another thing to like, this is your job. You gotta hustle. You gotta post a video every single day. You gotta post stories. You gotta make right scripts for YouTube videos, right? One thing is thinking about the side hustle every day. Another thing is working on that side hustle all day, every day. So my advice is try it first. Don't quit your day job to then try something new. It's too risky. And by the way, new businesses tend to take a while to start producing revenue. It took me hundreds of YouTube videos to get to a point where I could pay my rent with online revenue. I've been uploading content for over a decade. There's no get rich quick magic pill here. A lot of people are gonna offer you that online. It's just false. This is not true, it's a scam. But there absolutely is a way to get rich quick curve. You can choose smarter moves, better business models, leverage. And now with TikTok, AI tools, I'm telling you, this is the most level playing field that we've ever had. No college degree needed. I don't have a college degree. Even though I went to school for criminal justice, I quit to become a YouTuber. Who would have thought? No gatekeepers, you can find the information anywhere, everywhere, AI, TikTok, Instagram. It's just out there for the taking. So yeah, if you're ambitious, but you're lazy, that's not a weakness, that's your edge. You're gonna find ways to make it work, right? It means that you're wired for a leverage. You want results, not busy work. Not too long ago, Gary V was a big spokesperson for hustle culture and waking up early and getting done and you can see that he's changed his tone now. Why? Because that culture doesn't, it doesn't click anymore. People tried it and they burned out and they're like, wait a second, let's take a second here because I wanna live my life. I don't wanna be dumb about this. As far as I'm concerned, only have one life, depending on your religious beliefs. Let's enjoy it, right? Work smarter, not harder. You want the outcome, not the grind for the sake of grinding. That's not smart. But here's the thing, you still have to make a move. Sure, you don't have to grind yourself to death, but you still have to make a move. You still have to pick a direction. You still have to sacrifice, you know, a lot of mornings or nights, a lot of social gatherings or parties or whatever. You still have to build something. Just because the path is easier now, doesn't mean it's automatic, right? You have to choose it, you have to go for it. You have to get in the right vehicle. Otherwise, you're gonna be stuck. You'll be tired, frustrated, waking up early every day, working yourself to the ground and wondering why nothing's changing. Like I said, I've seen both sides. I've washed dishes in the back of a restaurant, I've done yard work for 10 hours a day for a few bucks and I've closed six figure brand deals from my phone for shooting a video. That's not bragging, that's just perspective. The 10 hours that I spent landscaping and it made, you know, a few bucks, I don't even know how much it was, $12 an hour. I worked harder doing that Then making that video that made me six figures. Way harder. And the difference is crazy financially. That's perspective. I know what it feels like. And I'll never forget where I started. Trust me, I remember. That's why I'm passionate about sharing this. Because, you know, not because I'm special, I'm not. I'm literally just a kid from Brazil who had to learn English when he got here two weeks before 9-11 and had a hard time adjusting. But I tried everything. And I saw an opportunity, I took it. I could have stayed in landscaping. I could have stayed working as an EMT, which like, It's cool, I get to wear a uniform, make shit money, but hey, girls like it. I could have worked at Google for the rest of my life, which would have been great, would have been fine, but I knew I wanted more, and I found a way to get it, and you can do it too. You just need to stop thinking that hard work alone will save you. It won't. If you wanna succeed and you don't wanna burn yourself to the ground, then pick the right vehicle. Stack, leverage, use the tools, build something that grows even when you're sleeping. Don't romanticize grinding, just because everyone else does. There's no reward for suffering. There's no badge of honor. Oh, congratulations. You only got four hours of sleep last night. Pick the smarter way. You know, pick the path that gives you peace, freedom, flexibility, because that's the real flex, not burnout, and also just something for you to think about. The sooner you start, the better. I think a lot of guys make this mistake of, hey, I'm gonna start it next week. I'm thinking about it. I've been thinking about doing this, been thinking about doing that. It's not all or nothing. Like I said, don't quit your job and then go do something else. Just start. 30 minutes to date, 30 minutes tomorrow. See how you feel. Keep going. It adds up, it stacks up. That's how you build leverage. That's how you find the right view. And if you've made it this far to the video, that means something. It means that you're ready. It means that you don't want to stay the same. It means that you want to grow. So don't waste that. Take this motivation that you have right now that you're feeling and get to it, man. Don't watch this and go back to doing the same thing that hasn't been working. You don't have to suffer your way to success. There's always a smarter way. I'm no better than you. I just found the right path. I stayed consistent. I built leverage and I gave it a lot of time and you can do it too. So what are you going to do differently now that you've watched this video. Let me know in the comments and subscribe so you don't miss the next one."

        "transcript": " Look, if you're subscribed to my channel, you already know that dressing well in every situation gives you an edge. And it's not about being flashy, it's about showing up with intention. And I realized pretty quickly into my fitness journey that dressing well may be more confident in the gym. It kept me motivated and he got me more excited to go to the gym so I could wear my new gym clothes. And look, let's be real, in today's world, the gym isn't just for working out, it's the social space. And who knows who you might run into at the gym. So I'm going to show you everything you need to build a stylish gym wardrobe including different brands, sneakers, hats, and gym tech like our sponsor the watch 5 by Huawei which we'll come back to later. So the first outfit is black, white, and gray. I know a lot of you don't like to wear colors so this is something that any guy can pull off. The tank is from on and I really like the fact that it's a sweater tank. It's great for warming up or if you're exercising outdoors when it's cold or outside. The shorts are from ASRV. It's one of my favorite gym brands. They have the black liner, the details on both sides which also happen to be pockets, not the biggest pockets, but hey, it gets the job done. The socks are also from ASRV. I bought a big pack of these to wear to the gym, so you're going to see them in other outfits too. These sneakers, every time I wear them, people ask me the sneaker ID. So these are the ASIC's GEL NYC. They're hard to find, but there's a bunch of other similar options like these or these that you can buy right now. The watch is the new Huawei Watch 5 and it's the perfect combination of performance, and sleek style. They offer the 42 or 46 millimeter dials. I chose the 42 millimeter because as you guys know, I don't really like big watches. I typically like smaller watches. I got it in black, but they do come in different colors. Even different bands like the titanium version, which you can wear with a nice outfit for a night out. In the Huawei Watch 5 and everything I mentioned in this video is linked in the description below to make it easy for you to shop. Moving on to the next outfit, keeping it in the same color scheme, but changing up the silhouette and going with the seamless muscle fit quarter zip by Gymshark. The seamless design makes it look and feel more premium. I got it in medium, but I could have probably done the large, it's a little tight on me. I'm five nine and 170 pounds for reference. The black shorts are also from Gymshark. And look, most of my Gymshorts are black with it in their liner. I like to go to workout classes like boxing or a various boot camp and I sweat like crazy. So the last thing I want is sweat marks all over my shorts. Black shorts won't show the sweat. So a pro tip for you guys is sweat a lot when you're working out. for black or darker colors. Then I'm wearing the ASR V-Socks and these new balance are called Warped Runner. They're a little bit chunkier and really comfortable for either the gym or sometimes I even wear them out to run errands in. Underneath the quarter zip, I'm wearing a Gymshark tank top in black. Now this outfit is great for you guys who are already in shape. It just shows off your shoulders and arms whether you're wearing the tank or the quarter zip over it. And the Huawei Watch compliments this outfit really well. The screen on this watch is insane. 3,000 nits of peak brightness, so you can always see the screen, whether you're indoors or outdoors, it's always gonna be sharp and colorful. But you know what, my favorite feature on this watch is the X-Tap feature. You see this button on the side here? Just tap any time for a quick mini health check because it covers your average heart rate, your heart rate variability, your SP02 in real time. You know when you go to the hospital and they clip your finger? This is very similar to that. It also tracks your stress levels, your skin temperature, your ECG, arterial stiffness, respiratory check, sleep, breathing awareness. So it's a very comprehensive report, all with just the tap of your fingertips. And if you wear it for more than a week, you get a weekly report of your health and you can track it over time. Another fun feature is the hand gestures so you can answer or deny a call, for example, just by swiping or tapping your fingers. So if you're doing something with your other hand, you don't need to use it at all to answer your phone call or switch the song that you're playing. Moving on to a rainy day in New York City. This is one of my favorite outfits from today's video. This is the Represent 247 hooded training jacket. It's lightweight, so it doesn't warm you up, but it's great for a wet day like today. If you're a runner, this looks amazing, and it's great for performance because it weighs nothing. Plus, it looks great, represent absolutely killed it with this one. The shorts are running shorts from Gymshark, and they're pretty short, so they're gonna show off more of your legs when you're working out if you're into that. I like the gray detail on the side of the shorts. You can see there's a theme here, right, with the black, white, and gray outfits, but don't worry, I am about to completely throw you off with the next fit. Now, let's talk about these sneakers, because I love these. They're the Mizuno Wave Prophecy sneakers. I haven't worn Mizuno sneakers since I was 12 years old living in Brazil. I used to play soccer in Mizuno cleats. So it's good to see that they're making a comeback. Underneath the jacket, I'm wearing a 247 tank top. If you haven't checked out 247 for workout gear, they're crushing it with their designs. Highly recommend you give them a browse. And if you're new here, this channel is all about men's fashion, men's lifestyle. It is my job to help you live a better life. And if this is something that you're interested in, hit the subscribe button, become a member of the YouTube family of over four million subscribers. We're on the road to five milli baby. Now, you guys know, I never really wear bright colors, but when it comes to workout attire, sometimes I like to have fun. So for this next fit, I'm wearing bright orange APL sneakers in collaboration with McLaren. These are crazy comfortable and crazy bright too. You can see them coming from a mile away. I just got this hoodie from Cuts Clothing. It's soft and cozy. It's been cold here in New York City this week, so this is perfect. I like the details like the metal hardware on the strings and the small riding on the chest. The shorts are from WUPE. Again, black with the inner lining. The hat is from Aloe. This hat has been through a lot. I work out wearing this hat at least a couple of times a week. I don't know if you guys do that too, if you have a workout hat. It's just easy to wake up, throw it on and hit the gym. And of course, the Huawei Watch 5. Something I forgot to mention is that you can choose from so many activities from the watch menu. You guys know I've been playing paddle lately. I love the sport and they even have that option here, which you don't typically find in other fitness wearables yet. It's just great to be able to see my health stats while I'm playing paddle. Moving on to the next outfit. I really like this Navy quarter zip from Halo. I got it in a medium, but this one definitely fits me better. It's not as tight as the Gymshark one. The shorts are from Vore. This is a brand that I've been seeing pop up everywhere. And I didn't have anything from them before this video. So I bought them to give them a try and show them in the video. I get the hype with the shorts. They're stretchy, they have a few pockets. I don't really like gym shorts that don't have pockets. It's actually a pet peeve of mine. These shorts are great. The sneakers again are the new balanced warp runners. The standout piece here is definitely the Navy Quarters. I love the color. It just makes this outfit come together nicely. So if you meet your gym crush in this outfit, you're in luck, it's just a stylish look. And like I said, I've been wanting to try clothes from Voury. So what I'm wearing in this next outfit is all Voury. The fabric on the great tank is very, very soft, feels great on the skin. The design is simple, there's nothing going on besides the logo on the side, but I prefer minimal designs anyway, so this is fine. Again, I really like the shorts, I'm gonna be wearing these a lot. The sneakers are the A6 Gel Hyano 14. A6 is another brand that had a big comeback over the past couple of years, and honestly, I'm here for it. Of course, paired with the Huawei Watch 5, if you wanna level up your gym fits and take your performance seriously, the Huawei Watch 5 is a no-brainer. I'm gonna drop all the links below so you can go and check everything out yourself. Let me know which outfit you like the most and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " I own hundreds of fragrances. I've been collecting them for years and today I wanna somehow choose seven that I just can't live without. These are the ones that I'll keep buying every time I run out, no matter how many other fragrances I have in my cabinet. I have so many fragrances in my collection that I was excited to buy. And then I go out, I buy it, I wear it once and I never wear it again because I keep coming back to these seven. And that's just the truth. If I had to clear out my entire fragrance shelf and keep only seven, which would break my heart, Because I'd love to pick more than seven. These are the seven that I would hold on to forever. Let's kick it off with summer in a bottle for me anyway. Tom Ford, Costa, Azura. This has notes of driftwood, seaweed, lemon, cypress, and oakwood. It's citrusy, it's woody. Now, this is my go-to summer fringes. I've worn it on a bunch of vacations to rooftop parties in New York City, in LA when I lived there. To meetings when I just wanna smell clean, but also elevated, right? Tom Ford to me always has that elevated scent. You always smell kind of expensive. Somehow he just really bottles up wealth and expensive and elevated all into his fragrances. So Tom Ford has done an incredible job when he comes to his fragrances. And I actually have two Tom Ford fragrances in the seven. And for me, it's just one of the best fragrances ever made for the summertime, for springtime. It's like a golden hour cocktail of a fragrance for me. And you know, you can see that I put a pretty good dent on this fragrance and to be honest with you, I don't really do that with a lot of my fragrances because I have hundreds of them. So that's like, it's impossible to go through fragrances when you have so many of them. So I really have to like it to even put this much of a dent in a fragrance like this. And this is my second bottle, by the way. So absolutely love this. I mean, I really love the packaging and I really love the scent. They did an incredible job. I can't live without this fragrance. I actually just started wearing this again now that it's a little bit warmer outside. So I'm excited to be able to wear this again now that it's spring and summertime. The next fragrance is actually a newer fragrance that I picked up about a year and a half ago. And it will always remind me of a trip that I went to that I just was a meaningful trip to me. I went to Dubai for new years from 2023 to 2024. This is the harmonist hypnotizing fire. It doesn't get enough attention, but it's magic. It's not one of the most popular scents. And to be honest, a lot of the fragrances that I chose today are very popular scents just because the fragrances kind of grew up with, the fragrances that really mean something to me are very popular, but it just, it speaks to me. It's very strong. It's so crazy strong this fragrance. Like, I can't spray more than three sprays with this fragrance. It's that kind of fragrance. It's very intense. It's powerful. It's warm. It's spicy. It's a little sweet. It's very, it can be very intimate if you don't spray a lot of it because it can also be very overwhelming if you spray yourself five times for example. It has notes of pimento berries, Bulgarian rose, patchouli, vanilla, and praline. It's a great fragrance to wear on dates if you go very light-handed. I'm telling you two to three sprays max. It's seductive without trying too hard. Definitely smells expensive. And to me, the bottle, the packaging, they just did an incredible job with this. I actually have a candle burning right now that is the Harmonus hypnotizing fire candle. And I love the way that that it makes my house smell. So not only is it a great fragrance for your body, we're going out, but also if you wanna get the candle, which it's a little pricey, but it's an incredible fragrance. And out of the seven, like I said, this is one of the few that not a lot of guys will be wearing. So if you want something more unique, it's this one here. This next fragrance is just something that I don't even wear that much anymore, but I can't live without it just because I have so many memories with this fragrance. And it just means so much to me. It's the Acurijo, Georgia from Georgia Armani, Profumo. So this is one of the most versatile, reliable fragrances that I've ever owned and I've repurchased this many times. If any time I see that I'm getting low, I just go ahead and I buy new one. This one, the bottle's about half full at the moment. Haven't sprayed it in a while, so I feel like I should. It just smells so good. It smells like any guy can wear this fragrance to anything. I can literally anything. You could wear this to the gym. You could wear this on a date. You could wear this to a job interview. If you go light, job interviews, you gotta be careful. You could wear this to anything and it won't offend anyone. Aquadijoe in general, right? Like it's just mass appealing. Everyone will love it, but Profumo, they somehow one-upped themselves with this one and I highly recommend it to any guy. It's an incredible fragrance. It's got notes of bergamot, incense, patchouli, and marine accord. Now, imagine everything that you love about Aquadijoe, the original, because, you know, let's be honest, it's one of the best-selling fragrances of all time. if not might be the best selling fragrance of all time, but it's deeper, it's more mature, it's more elegant, it's fresh, but not like a childish fresh, it's a more serious elevated fresh, light enough for daytime, rich enough for nighttime, it's the Swiss Army knife of fragrance, as it does everything, it covers all grounds. Talk about a signature scent, right? An actual signature scent that you can just wear anytime, anywhere, this is it right here. Next up, I kept thinking, you know, should I include this? but there's just no way I couldn't include this because if I had to throw everything else away from my cabinet in terms of fragrances, there's no way I could throw this away. This is a special, maybe the most special fragrance in my cabinet. This is Forte series protagonist. Now, of course I had to include this one because I made it, but protagonist to me is so much more than a cent. It's a story, you know, that's why I called it protagonist. It's about stepping into that story with confidence. And yes, it's about, to me, my story, But to you, it's about your story. It's about your hero journey. It's about what you are doing to become the man that you were always destined to be, right? And I know maybe it sounds corny, but I just remember having long sessions with my team at Forte discussing what should we create when it comes to fragrances. There's thousands of fragrances out there. Like it needs to be interesting. It needs to be cool. I want a good story. I want a good sense. And that's how protagonist was born. It's for the guy who's ambitious, guy who is centered, the guy who knows what he wants, what he can bring to the table. It's got notes of bergamot, cardamom, orange flower, geranium, vanilla, and amberwood. And it opens up with this fresh, clean, magnetic vibe, and it settles into like a warm, smooth base, and it oozes confidence. It smells like confidence. This is your, you know, I was talking about profumo and how this is a great signature scent. That's exactly what we wanted to do with Protagonist, and we were able to do it. You can wear year round, you can wear on a date, You can wear it to the gym, you can wear it anywhere you want. And that's exactly what we did with this. And I'm so grateful that the Forte community and you guys agreed with that because I was really putting myself out there when I made this fragrance. So it was scary, but obviously I can't get rid of this. And this isn't on the list antagonist, but obviously I wouldn't get rid of this either. But I don't want to take up two spots on the list with Forte fragrances, but antagonist is kind of the opposite of protagonist. If this is the hero, this is the anti-hero, It's the dark, mysterious rival. It's got saffron, black pepper, Oud, Tonka bean, and then a slight hint of passion fruit, which when I say that people are like, what, passion fruit? Trust, trust me, it's insanely good. And this is one of those fragrances like hypnotizing fire that you cannot spray a lot of it because it punches you in the face. It's really powerful. So that's all I'm gonna say about antagonist, an incredible fragrance. and if you love it, you absolutely love it. This next fragrance, I got it last summer and I think it came out last summer too, I'm not sure, but I wore the sh** out of this fragrance last summer and you can bet your a** that I'm gonna be doing the same thing this summer. This might be my top three fragrances for summertime since I got it last year. This is Pafum Damali Perseus and it's such a gem. This is bright, very vibrant, even from the bottle you can you can tell, but it's still classy. It's fresh, it's young, it's very heavy on the grapefruit. So the notes are grapefruit, bergamot, vetiver, and ambergris. It's basically spring, summer, and a bottle. But you do have to like that citrusy, you know, that grapefruit vibe because it's pretty heavy on that. But man, what an incredible fragrance. Like, from the Mali, they make some beautiful fragrances, but this one just really spoke to me and you can't feel it, but it's like, it's getting empty, man, which for one year only, that's crazy. Typically when I go on trips, I'll bring this if it's a summer trip. So that tells you everything you need to know. This is an incredible, incredible fragrance. Got energy, it gives me that confidence that I'm gonna smell good, even when on a hot summer, like humid day, it's not gonna just melt on my skin, and which is really, really important for a summer fragrance. For example, this is another summer fragrance that does that. And this one wasn't on the list, But Hermes H24 to me is one of those fragrances that maybe not as good as Perseus, but really, really great fragrance. Doesn't make me feel like I'm melty in the summer. Very light, inoffensive, and just beautiful. So another great choice here for you guys is looking for a summer fragrance. The next fragrance that I have on the list is a fragrance that some people tend to sh** on. Some people absolutely live by and love. And I'm on that second category. I live by and I love my Creed Aventus. It was my first expensive bottle of fragrance. I actually got it as a gift for my 30th birthday from my friend, Benjamin Seta, based Zeus himself. And man, you know, I just remember being so happy when I opened this. It's just a classic. It's just a classic. And I was looking at my cabin and tried to decide which seven I wanted to go with. And I couldn't get rid of this one. You know, I have it in this bottle. I have the 10 year anniversary bottle, which is stunning as well. And you guys know that I work with Creed a lot. And to me, you know, it's an amazing brand That makes incredible sense. Been doing it for a long time. I'm actually going to France with them next month. And honestly, that has nothing to do with why I picked this fragrance. It's just an absolutely beautiful fragrance and it deserves this spot. It has notes of pineapple, birch, black currant, musk and oak moss. It's iconic for a reason. You know, it's masculine, but not overpowering, right? It's bold, but not something that you're gonna get tired of. The only problem with creed is that it became too popular. And that actually is a trend with fragrances that are really good, right? What's the problem with Dior Sauvage? It's not that it's a bad fragrance, as a matter of fact, it's one of the best fragrances ever made. And that is the problem, right? Too many guys wear it. So it's kind of like death by popularity when it comes to fragrances, right? Because too many guys wearing it means that it's now generic, not special. You don't wanna spray creed on or Dior Sauvage. Smells incredible. But then you go talk to a girl and she's like, oh, you smell like my ex-boyfriend. Just shoot me now. And you know, and unfortunately, when you become too popular, that's what happens when it comes to fragrances. However, you can't deny that these are incredible, incredible fragrances. And when I got this fragrance, like I said, I turned 30 and I was wearing, you know, my YouTube channel started to pick up and I was feeling really good and I was wearing this to meetings, I was wearing it to dates, I was wearing it to go out and hang out with my friends to go to clubs. It was the first time that I like had some disposable income and I was enjoying life and this will always bring back those memories. Always. You know, fragrances are like time machines sometimes. You smell it and it just brings you back. I have a fragrance Calvin Klein eternity that I have in my cabinet that I never wear. But once in a while, I'll just open, pull up the bottle, smell it and just remember of me being in high school and wearing Calvin Klein eternity. Literally in high school, in eighth grade. And you know, I'm never gonna wear it, but I love it. I love smelling it and going back in time. Back in time when I was a little kid with pimples and had no idea what I was doing with my life, barely spoke English, it's very skinny, you know, and was just having fun, just figuring out who I was. For this last fragrance, you know, I have three fragrances here in front of me. I'm gonna choose one just because I have to. This is not when decisive I am when it comes to this stuff because I have the fragrances here and I'm like, Let me pick like 10 and now choose the seven on the spot. And you know, these are two that I was really thinking about going with. I'm gonna go with ombre leather. I think Baudageur might be maybe even technically a better fragrance. It's easier to wear. But ombre leather just has a special place in my heart. You guys know that I always recommend this fragrance. So I don't wanna sound like a broken record, but it's an incredible fragrance. If you like that leather, sweet leather scent. You know, it's not for everyone. It's not a people pleaser. It's not a mass appealing scent, but if you like this fragrance, it is an absolutely incredible fragrance. Ah, just smelling it, just, literally I got goosebumps smelling this. It's got notes of violet leaf, cedarwood, leather, green tobacco. It's like this deep confidence that comes with wearing this set. It's a little, it's not overpowering per se because it has this like sweet undertone to the heavy leather. It's definitely not a summer fragrance, so it's for fall and winter. It's for date nights. I wouldn't wear this during the day. I would not wear this during the day. This is a nighttime fragrance. This is for the guy who maybe has already like three, four, five fragrances in his collection. And then he picks this up. It's not like, oh, let me buy my first fragrance, Tom Ford ombre leather perfume. It's too strong for that. So, oh, it's just so good. I'm gonna have to wear this again very soon before it gets too hot to wear it. One thing I've learned about fragrances too is, Guys, I'm choosing these seven fragrances for life, but there are chapters of your life and you keep kind of, you change the fragrances that you wear for each of those chapters. Like I did for Calvin Klein Eternity when I was in high school. Like I was wearing Aqueduct Joe shortly after that. Like I was wearing Perseus last summer. I'm probably not gonna wear it for the next five summers, but for this chapter of my life, living in New York City, enjoying summertime in New York City. I'm gonna remember this every time I smell this fragrance. I'm gonna remember this chapter of my life. So use that power that fragrances give you, which is this time machine. Bottle up this chapter of your life into a bottle. Put it into any of these fragrances that I mentioned. Put one summer of your life into these fragrances. And it's just a beautiful thing. It's just amazing. This is, to me, the best thing about a fragrance, is being able to bottle up a memory into one of these. So if you wanna see all of these fragrances, I've listed them all below. I would love to know what your favorite fragrances are right now, so comment them below, and I'll be going through the comments today, and I'll see you guys in the next video."

        "transcript": " When I moved into my New York City apartment, the goal wasn't to just make it look good. I wanted it to be smart. So today I'm showing you the tech that I use in my apartment every single day that actually makes my life easier and that I'd recommend to any guy wanting to upgrade his space. Starting with this little device here, which is the real MVP, Google Home runs my whole apartment. My lights, my speakers, my shades, you name it. When I want to set the vibe for when guests come over, all I gotta do is just ask Google Home to turn on the mood lighting in the living room. If I wanna play my favorite playlist in every room while I'm getting ready, all I have to do is ask Google to play music everywhere. And it's gonna do that. And my favorite thing is coming into my office every morning and asking Google to turn everything on instead of having to do it manually, which would take forever. Hey Google, turn all of my lights on. Magic. Now some people prefer Alexa. I've always had a Google Home because as some of you know, I worked at Google for three years. So I have a connection with that brand and with the tech. I have one in pretty much every room. And let me just geek out here for a second. I can't wait until they put Gemini into every single one of these Google homes because then it's gonna be like having a real virtual assistant at home who knows everything about you, who helps you send emails, who can order supplies for you, who can just do everything for you. And I'm pumped for that day to come. If you want a good vibe in your home, you need to have good speakers. So I have Sonos speakers set up throughout my entire apartment, living room, bedrooms, and even in the bathrooms. And the best part is that you can choose if you wanna play in all the speakers or in just some. I can take a shower, then get ready in my bedroom, then make a coffee in the kitchen, and the music doesn't stop at any point because I have speakers in all of those places. But if I'm taking an important call in my office, I can just mute the speaker in the office so everyone else in my place can still listen to music while my office is nice and quiet. And look, I know there are cheaper options out there, but the Sonos quality is insane. It's crisp, it's rich. The bass on the sub is crazy powerful and it's easy. It's seamless to install and sync with each other. So in my opinion, Sonos is the way to go. Plus Sonos has the Google Home integration. So they work really well together. It's a match made in heaven. And it just makes my life so much easier. I don't have to touch a single button to play music in my entire apartment. Next up, just last year, I got these Ryze Smart Shades. And they've been a game changer. I mean, I wake up and I just say, hey Google, bring up my shades, bring down my shades. It's incredible. So obviously I could come over here and just press the button and it's gonna bring the shades down. But to me, I might as well just do it with my hands and pull it down if that's the case. So what I did is I actually connected it to my Google Home so I can say, hey Google, close my bedroom shades. And then it's gonna start closing it just through my voice, which is the way to go. Okay, I was like, oh my, is this gonna happen or what? I will say, even though they're motorized and they do it pretty quickly and they have the Google Home integration, sometimes they break. By sometimes I mean all the time. Like once every two weeks, something happens and I have to fix it. So they're still pretty finicky. I love the tech and I love being able to do it with my voice as opposed to having to do it manually. But I will say they break all the time. Now I'm not sure if it's something that I have done wrong or if it's just, you know, their first iteration of this product, but unfortunately they're just not that reliant. But if you have shades at home when you want to motorize them, this is the way to go. I haven't found anything better than this. So I still recommend it. It kind of makes it feel like you're in a hotel room, you know, and you can just bring up the shades by pressing one button, but in reality, you don't even have to press a button, which is even better. You can also schedule yours to open with sunrise and close automatically in the evening. So every morning you wake up to natural light and every night when you go into bed, it just literally comes down at a specific time, let's say 10 p.m. Just recently, I made a huge upgrade to my office that honestly was life-changing and I'm kicking myself for not having it done earlier. This is the FlexiSpot standing desk with the under desk treadmill. I mean, this setup right here is just incredible. It literally changed my life. I was reading this book called The Five Types of Wealth and the author was talking about taking meetings outside as he's walking around. Now, I'm not gonna do that. New York is really loud and just chaotic. So what I decided to do is get a treadmill for under my desk and now I take my meetings as I am walking very slowly. You know, I'm not panting or anything, but it does bring your heart rate up. And for me, it makes me think better. It makes me be quicker on my feet, no pun intended, as opposed to sitting down. And you get kind of lazy, you get kind of comfortable, right? Sometimes maybe even distracted and just too relaxed. So I prefer to be standing and I prefer to be walking when I'm taking my calls. FlexiSpot sponsored this video. They sent me these two amazing desks. So I got one for Rodrigo, my videographer, one for myself. You can set the height that you want and then it memorizes it. So you have the height set for standing up and then you have the height set as well for sitting down. And you can change it so easily. All you gotta do is press a button on the side. So you control the height right here. You can go up or down in small increments, but you also have your memory. So for me, when I press one, it just has a specific height for standing. And when I press two, it goes to the exact height of my chair. So I can just press two, grab my chair, sit down, and I'm ready to go. Now the funny thing is I had one of these when I was working at Google for three years and I swear I probably brought it up like twice. Now that I just got this, I stand the majority of the time, especially on Mondays where I take all of my calls. It just makes my posture better. It makes me more involved in my calls too. If I'm sitting, sometimes I get a little bit too relaxed and it feels like I'm not in it to win it. I've been wanting to get a stand-up desk for a really long time just because I've been sitting so much. I'm on my computer all the time and I'm sure you guys are the same. A standing desk is life changing. It feels so much better to stand. I just feel so much more alive. My posture is better. And then of course the treadmill, if you wanna go above and beyond is even better. And I even got these file cabinets to go under the desks because I like to have drawers right next to me. If I need a pen, if I need a post-it note, if I need anything, it's just right there, easy to reach. You know how people say you should be getting 10,000 steps a day, I'll be honest with you guys. I go to the gym every day and I work out, but sometimes I'm not gonna get those 10,000 steps because I'm just working on my desk. So this is changing that for me. You know, I would knock out five to 7,000 steps just on meetings, and that's the level of efficiency that I want from my space, right? I'm working, I'm moving, I feel more alive, I'm not sacrificing focus or posture. So FlexiSpot, thank you for sending me these desks. They're amazing. I've been using them every single day. If you work from home, if you spend serious time at a desk like I do, this setup changes everything. I'm gonna leave a link to everything below so you guys can check out the standup desk from FlexiSpot, as well as the treadmill and the fire cabinet, which are also from FlexiSpot. It's all linked in the description below. Now on top of my FlexiSpot desk, you see this huge monitor that I got, and you can find this monitor anywhere. Honestly, the hardest part about this monitor was finding the right monitor arm, because it's not just about aesthetics, it needed to be really strong, because it's a very heavy monitor. So I got this arm, I think I got it from B&H. It's really good for your posture to make sure that you have an eye level, so you're not looking up or especially looking down. And this monitor arm is really strong and hefty. So you can move it around pretty easily. You can go up, down, you can literally rotate it as well if you want a vertical monitor. And I think the best thing about it is that it clears up any space on your desk, right? So there's no monitor stand. It's just literally your arm clamped to the desk. So you have all of the desk space available to you right there. Now let's head into the bedroom because I just got something that completely changed my life. and I want to share this with you guys. I got an eight sleep. This is something brand new. I just literally got it a week ago and it's been life changing. It's not just a mattress cover. It's a full smart sleep system. So he cools the bed on hot nights. It warms it up when it's freezing out and it even tracks everything from your heart rate to your sleep quality, to how many minutes you've spent snoring. I mean, it just tells you everything about your sleep. And here's the best part. It has dual zones. So if you and your partner have different sleep temperatures, You're both covered. Typically my girlfriend runs pretty cold, so hers is set to be warmer, and I run pretty warm, so mine is set to be cooling. Typically at night I'll wake up sweaty, you know, it's just like sometimes uncomfortable. With the eight sleep, that doesn't happen. It just maintains your body temperature throughout the entire night, and it adjusts it. So if the room gets too cold, it warms it up. If your body gets too warm, it cools it down. I read on my app this morning that it adjusted my temperature 26 times last night to make sure that I was in optical sleeping temperature. That's pretty incredible. You guys know that I wear a woop every single day. I track my sleep, I track my strain. I really like tracking all of the data on my body. So when we got the eight sleep, it was just for me exactly what I wanted. And besides all of the tracking, it also just helps me sleep a lot better. Something else that I just got, and it was kind of an impulse buy, but it was incredible. I'm so glad I got it. Is this Matic vacuum? This thing is so sleek. It's not one of those like bulky Roomba that honestly are kind of dumb. They just hit everything. This has AI built in, it has a bunch of cameras built into it. It's like the Tesla of vacuums, right? It literally just goes around everything. And it's funny because I have a dog Truffle, as you guys may know, and it just like goes around Truffle. And sometimes, you know, my guitar is on the ground and it just doesn't hit anything. It's really, really intelligent. And I'm surprised at how quiet this thing is. So it vacuums really well, including little corners, and then you go and mop if you want it to mop as well, which is great. So sometimes let's say I'll go out for the day, right off the out for three, four hours. And I'll just start the matting and leave and I'll come back and my floors are perfectly clean. I have dark wood floors too, which means you can really see the dust or any dirt on the floors. So I was just getting tired of vacuuming every single day. So this is a really good in between. It doesn't really go deep. You know, if you really want to get the little nooks and corners, then I use a Dyson vacuum. But for everyday maintenance, it's perfect. You can schedule it to run a couple of hours before you get home from work, for example. So then by the time you're back, the floors are spotless, the hardwood floors, the rugs, it doesn't matter, it handles it all. So if you want your place looking clean with low effort, this is the way to go. Now, I think maybe the most fun piece of tech in the apartment is the Ninja Creamy. If you guys haven't heard of this thing, I mean, I just heard about it last year and I got it immediately. It's a cheat code for healthy desserts. So the Creamy makes ice cream, but you can make healthy ice cream. I'll tell you exactly how I do mine. I literally just do a protein shake, just water, protein powder, and then you freeze it, put it into the cream in the next day, and you blend it up, and it makes it into a soft texture ice cream. It's so good, and it's so healthy. If you wanna add some coconut flakes in there, if you wanna add some chocolate chips, you can. Whatever you wanna add in as a mix in, you're absolutely able to do that. I try to keep mine healthy, but of course, once in a while, I'll have a sweet tooth, and I just throw in some chocolate chips in there, and it's such a good, healthy dessert. If you have a sweet tooth, if you wanna cheat meal at night, if you're craving ice cream or craving something sweet and you're on a diet, you're trying to watch your form, you're trying to bulk, you're trying to do whatever. This is such a good technology for you to have at home because then you can just literally make healthy ice cream right at home. It does have one flaw. It's so incredibly loud. The first time I turned it on, I thought it was broken. It sounds like a jet plane taking off. I was like, this thing's about to blow up. Oh my God. But then I went online, checked it out and that's just how it's supposed to sound. Maybe they'll make a new one that doesn't sound as loud, but for now, unfortunately, you just have to cover your ears or just dial up the Sonos while it's going. Having the right tech at home is honestly live changing. So let me know in the comments below which of this tech you liked the best. And of course, thank you to FlexiSpot for sponsoring today's video. If you guys wanna check out their standing desks, I'm gonna leave everything linked in the description below. See you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Lux Maxing is one of the biggest trends on social media right now. You go on TikTok and all you see are these kids talking about how to make your jaw look sharper, how to make your cheeks more hollow, even how to grow taller in your 20s after you're supposed to be done growing. But do they actually work? Well today I'm ranking all of the popular Lux Maxing techniques from S tier which is the absolute best all the way down to C tier which is complete bullshit and you should stay far far away from it. This guy man. This guy, what a legend. What a legend. Things go viral on social media and I just laugh because it's so over the top. It's so exaggerated. It just makes no sense. He's just posting videos of the most unrealistic morning routines or routines in general possible. You know, I'm not sure if it's satire, if he's just like leaning into it and making fun of himself or what. But for the sake of the video, let's just focus on two things that he's doing on these routines. on two things that he's doing on these routines. First, we do the bowl of iced water, iced Saratoga to be specific. Dunking your face into iced water has its benefits. It's going to deep up your face, it's gonna improve circulation, it's gonna give you some energy, make you more alert. So there are some benefits, but let's be honest, I mean, he's going over the top with this. There's no reason for you to do all of this, especially for you to use Saratoga water. And I have so many questions. Like when you shower, do you also use Saratoga? Is that the only thing you put on your face? why do you use a bottle of Saratoga, which by the way, I love Saratoga water, but like I wouldn't use it just to dunk my face into it. So I'm going to leave those questions aside for now. And I'm going to rank this a B tier because it has its benefits and it doesn't do any harm, right? Personally though, I would prefer, and this is what I do is take a cold shower. Or if I take a warm, you know, room temperature shower, then I just finished with 30 to 60 seconds of cold water to get me that energy, to give me that, to wake me up and alert me and also to deep puff my body and my face instead of dunking my face into a bowl of iced Saratoga. Ha ha ha ha. Well, the banana peel on the face, man. I don't really understand. This is the second thing that I want to read from this video. I mean, I'm going to have to rate that a C tier. And I actually did some research on it and it says, although a banana peels contain antioxidants and vitamins, the effectiveness is minimal, anecdotal, and it lacks scientific evidence. So it's harmless, but it's also not effective. The truth is that to get views nowadays, you have to shock the viewer. You know, we're so numb to things nowadays. We're just scrolling, looking for that dopamine hit. We're numb to content. We're numb to ads. We're numb to influencers. So for a video to make you stop and actually pay attention and watch the whole thing, it needs to shock you. He needs to really grab your attention. This is what he's doing here. You know, he's trying to grab your attention with these weird things that he's doing throughout his routine. I applied a constant layer of castor oil over one side of my face for an entire week. Why you might ask? Well, for an entire week, castor oil on one half of your face. That's nuts, man. These people are going crazy. So castor oil historically has been used to increase hair growth, whether it's on your actual scalp, your eyelashes, your eyebrows, women use it, men are using it on their beard. And there's evidence that it does work for hair growth. I'm not sure about the whole skin thing, making your skin better or getting rid of stretch marks. I think that is a stretch in itself. But for hair, it has been proven to work. I'm going to give this one an A tier. I think this is our first item on the A tier here because honestly, it does work. It takes a while. But you also have to understand what are you using this for? You just want thicker brows or thicker lashes. It's a minimal difference. It's not going to absolutely change your face, but of course, it's going to make you look better, you know, slightly. It's just one extra notch on your belt. So, so why not? I've been thinking about doing a giveaway for a while and I decided now is the perfect time. So here's the deal. I'm giving away over $400 in fragrances, plus a Forte series Dock kit filled with our best sellers to one of you watching this video. It's absolutely free to join.

I'm so excited to be able to launch these emails every Monday now because of you guys. I really appreciate the help and the partnership. Again, it's free to enter. The link is below. Good luck. The next one is no state. Oh my God, did he edit that? Hold on, I gotta watch this again. He literally edited his nose to make it look like he had a notch, like he make it look like he had a bigger nose. That's insane. doesn't even have that arch. You can see that it's edited. And then he does the after and he puts the little check mark literally covering his nose as well. So not only is this fake, it's completely fake, Gabriel. I don't know why you're posting fake shit online like this, but also for you to come on here and say advice for young men. That's so that you would do that. And look, putting tape on your nose isn't going to change the shape of your nose. It's just not going to do it. Otherwise plastic surgeons would be offering nose jobs for $20,000, $30,000, right? I will say the nose strips work. They make you breathe better. So that works. Now, taping your nose to shape your nose in any way, that's not gonna do anything. That kind of tape is not gonna do anything. You need a very specific type of nose strip that's gonna open up your nostrils. That, this one that I'm wearing here, that actually works, but it's not looks maxing. That's just better for your breathing. Nose strips are gonna go ATR. The nose tape is gonna go C tier. Let's stay on the tape. You'll see these people, they're mouth breathers. And it also changed face shape. Yeah, so this is a wild book called Jaws, a hidden epidemic by colleagues of mine at Stanford. There's one case of this young girl. She got a hamster, I think it was. Got a allergy to the hamster and literally took this beautiful young girl and her face just starts aging at a rapid rate. They get rid of the hamster. She goes back to nasal breathing. They do a little encouragement of nasal breathing using the mouth closure thing at night. Do a little bit of medical tape. And like her, these beautiful, almost like model-esque features come back in this girl. Jaw shape and the clear edge of the nasal passages. And this was known in the 1800s. There was a book called Shut Your Mouth by a British doctor who talked about the fact that people who snore sleep like this. And then during the daytime, they become mouth breathers. He said they become less attractive than the people who are. This one is interesting because there is some research that actually shows that mouth breathing is bad for you. So when you're taping your mouth, you're basically limiting that or basically just completely canceling that so you can breathe through your nose, right? So there's definitely truth to that. I'm gonna give this one a B tier. And the reason why it's not an S or A tier is because I found that there are some risks associated with using a mouth tape as well. I think it's better for you to just create that habit of breathing through your nose as opposed to completely blocking off your mouth when you're going to sleep, especially when you're going to sleep, because who knows if you're not feeling well at night, you might feel a lot of discomfort, you might wake up freaking out, so it deserves a B tier ranking for this one. But it does work. Dermarola uses needles and is one of the best treatments against hair loss. But here's what most people do wrong. First, you need to choose the correct needle size. The best needle size is between 0.3 and 1.5 millimeters. Never use needles longer than that for your safety. Second, to use the dermarola. wet your hair to expose the thinning area. Create a parting where you want your hair to grow back. Roll the derma roller five to seven times horizontally. Lift the roller and do the same five to seven times vertically. This got crazy popular too. Probably over COVID, I would say, everyone started talking about derma rolling. And especially for people that have scars, like acne scars, you create micro tears with very, very tiny needles that don't even hurt. I've tried it myself. And that tear then tells your body to, hey, let's fix this tear. let's go and rejuvenate the skin and it creates new skin. I will say there is some truth to that, but with derma rolling, the problem is the angle that it goes into your skin, it actually does more damage than good. So I'm gonna give this one a C tier, but the next one is micro needling. And micro needling, I would say is much, much better because it basically stamps your skin straight in and out with those tiny needles. And that's gonna be way better than the rollers, which cause actual tears that are gonna damage your skin. So if you're gonna choose between dermaroling or micro needling, just remember, micro needling is the way to go. It boosts collagen production, it rejuvenates the skin, it doesn't really hurt, it's very easy to do, you can do it at home, it's very affordable, and micro needling gets an A tier for me, especially if you have any acne scars or scars in general, or any uneven texture on your skin. Oh God, no. No. Stop. How? Tell me. There's gotta be something else. You're telling me that with these... what was it? Five? Five exercises. Including child's pose, you're going to grow taller after you're 18 years old. Come on man. Come on. This is such. Then yoga instructors would be six, seven, all of them because they do this every single day for hours a day. That's not going to work. That's just clearly. He's just trying to get your attention and I mean, it's working. He's getting a lot of views from it. The comments are probably, it's really working, bro. stretching really works. Wow, we can grow after 25 years. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Look, I think there's some truth to appearing taller when you stretch, when your posture is correct, right? You just stand up straight and wow, look at that. I just gained another inch. That's pretty obvious. Are you actually growing? No, you're not growing. So I think height maxing in general, Stay far, far away from that because it's just trying to get your attention, trying to get views. You have to remember that social media is a game of views. It's a game of attention. These people are just trying to get you to watch their content, click into their content and watch that content for as long as possible so they can get even more views and get brand deals or sell their courses or whatever it is. So this is just bullshit. This gets C tier. If there was anything below C tier, trash tier, let's just create it right now. Now this gets trash tier, it is complete bullshit. Let's move on to the next one, jawline gum. It's the new trend catching on with young men and boys. My jaw feels like it's had an insane workout. I've been twos stuff for a couple of weeks, it definitely strengthens and builds the jaw muscles. Facial fitness gum is all the rage on TikTok. These before and after photos showing the square jaw look some teens want. I love these before and afters are just ridiculous. Just a hard gum, we'll strengthen your jawline. Basically what it is, is you're chewing very tough gum to build muscle here on your jaw, and therefore making your jaw wider because the muscle is bigger. Does it work? Yes, it does work, right? Essentially you have this big muscle right here, and you're working that muscle by chewing very hard onto this gum. Now, there are so many risks with this, it's not worth it. Let me tell you why. One, you're chewing on one side of your mouth, and then you're going onto the next side. What does that mean? You're creating an imbalance on your face. Yeah, you can say I'm gonna do 10 here and 10 there. It doesn't matter. It's still gonna be different. You can't really control exactly what you're doing. So now your face might look asymmetrical. And not only that, the difference it makes is so minimal. It's so minute. It does no point in you doing this. Guys, all of these transformations that these people are showing you is because they lost weight. It's so obvious. You can see it on their face. It's not just their jaw. You can see their neck. You can see their cheeks. You can see even all over their face, they just had a little bit of extra fat, they lost the fat, and now look at that, I have a jawline. It's not the gum, it's just that you lost a few points in your percentage of body fat. Case closed, that is it. This one gets a C tier. Look, you can do it. Does it make your jawline a little bit bigger? It does, you just have to be super careful. I just wouldn't depend on that for you to look your absolute best. If you wanna look your best, just lose a little bit away. You know what I mean? Just hit the gym, just cut your calories a little bit, and look at that, all of a sudden you have a jaw line. That's it, it's not the gum, it's not mewing, which is actually next year. There's a mewing craze taking over the kitchen. Let's check out this mewing video right here. It's towering a curable way to snatch your face and jaw without any surgery. And the best part is, it's free! Is mewing a miracle shortcut to reshaping jaws and improving teeth? Or is it just another fad designed to claim your eyeballs and steal your digital attention? Let's find out immediate results are almost certainly fake. There was recently an article in the lore. Exactly, immediate results for mewing are pretty much impossible. So what does that mean? When you're mewing, you're actually pushing your tongue up on the roof of your mouth, while you're creating pressure here, and you are working out your muscles around your jaw and your mouth. And it was popularized by this guy called Dr. Mike Mew. I've done a ton of research on this. I've read a lot about this. I've talked about it in some of my videos. and it does reshape your jaw slightly. Does it work? Yeah, it does work. I'm gonna give it a B tier because it does change the shape of your facial structure slightly. But again, guys, we're not talking about something that's gonna completely change overnight. We're not talking about something that people are gonna notice. No one will notice besides you. Trust. What people will notice is when you lose body fat on your face and your jaw looks sharper. It says, users report subtle improvements over time, but due to slow progress and varying results, it is not as effective as you might think. All right, next up we have neck training, neck maxing. All right, let's see what this next one is. Lando Norris, my man. Training his neck. Oh man, that looks painful. So these Formula One drivers, their necks are crazy strong, like crazy, crazy strong. It's funny because they're pretty skinny, you know, they're not supposed to be very heavy, of course, because that affects your speed, but their necks massive, very muscular. I mean, look at that. Very strong because they're doing g-force turns of, I think up to three or, I don't know, I don't want them to speak, but they're doing high g-force turns and they need their neck to be very strong and stable during those turns. That's why they do these crazy workouts. But having said that, I mean, I think neck maxing or training your neck, I'm going to give it an S tier. It's going to get an S tier because it does make a big difference in two aspects of your life. One, it makes you look better. It does make you look more muscular. It makes you look healthier. It makes you look stronger. And the second benefit of that is have better posture. It actually makes you, especially nowadays with everyone just, you know, kind of doing one of these. When you're training your neck, it just provides you with the proper posture and the proper structure for you to look healthier and look stronger. So this is our S tier looks maxing habit, honestly. And I think it's a simple, free, semi-low effort way of improving your looks and improving your health. It improves your, it technically improves your jawline definition as well because you're working out all of these muscles here. You don't need all of those crazy machines or the personal trainer pulling you like Lando Norris. Obviously he's a professional. You can do very easy neck exercises at home for free a couple times a week and you will notice a difference. What's this next one? Okay, this is a legendary video. Here is a basic thumb pulling routine that you can leverage to get faster, more effective results. You combine all three thumb pulling techniques. 17 and 19. Thumb pulling, thumb pushing and natural thumb pulling. Okay. In one routine that you do every morning or every night to get 10 extra results that you're currently getting. Oh my God. 16 and 19 that's the difference. It will develop your maxilla, it will bring your jaw upwards and forwards, it will improve your... How does that happen? It will improve your breathing, you are going to be the best version of yourself, not only in terms of looks, but also in terms of health. For reference, I wasn't intern at the Academy of Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy as well as at the... He was an intern at the Academy of Orofacial Myofunctional Therapy. Okay? Academy of Applied Myofunctional... Let's check out this place. So he was an intern at the Academy of Orifacial Myofunctional Therapy. I just looked it up. It says it's temporarily closed. Let's see what this place looks like. This is what the place looks like. He was an intern at, let's take another look here, at this Academy right here. This is what it looks like. Come on guys, like, it's just, it's just kind of a joke, you know? It's just kind of a joke. And the thing is like, would you trust this place to change your face? You know, and it's not even this whole place. It's sweet 106 of this place. So it's one office inside this place right here, which looks, it looks sketch, let's be honest. I live in LA. But look, thumb pulling is one of those things that I've been seeing more and more recently. And the concept is kind of crazy because you're essentially pulling your thumb, you're pushing your thumb against the roof of your mouth as you're pulling your chin down and you're changing your facial structure. Right, that's what you're supposed to be doing. You're changing your facial structure by pushing hard against the roof of your mouth. And you're supposed to put a lot of force, It's supposed to be uncomfortable and it's supposed to change your face and your, and your mouth. And it's funny cause I, when I was doing research on this, some guy was like, isn't that going to change my teeth? You know, it's going to give me like buck teeth. It's going to basically move my teeth forward, give me an overbite. And there's some guy replied, of course not. You're not using as much strength as you need to change the shape of your teeth. And I'm like, you literally said that you're supposed to use enough strength to change your complete facial structure, but it's not going to change the shape of your teeth. Of course it is. You have to do it right. It's so risky. there is really no point in doing it. There's really no point. And he showed photos of himself at 16 and then at 19. Guys, the difference from 16 to 19, and let's say, you know, that's an early, he had just turned 16 and he was almost 20 in the second photo, the difference in those three to four years is massive. Your whole body changes. Here's a photo of me at 16. Here's a photo of me at 19. Here's another photo of me at 19 just much later. Completely different people. So I did some research into thumb pulling just, just to make sure that I wasn't, you know, going crazy here, but there's no formal scientific studies specifically validating thumb, thumb pulling as effective for aesthetic facial remodeling. There is possible subtle reshaping of softer tissues through continuous pressure. Some people claim slight improvements in cheekbone prominence or symmetry, but there are potential risks and downsides. For example, facial asymmetry, skin and soft tissue damage, TMJ issues, unrealistic expectations, Investing lots of time into thumb pulling might distract from proven techniques like fitness proper grooming nutrition and skincare Which are far more effective ways of looks maxing. This is exactly what I was telling you guys I think there is just so much bullshit online right now, and I'm not saying that it doesn't work at all I'm not saying that it has zero percent effectiveness But maybe let's say it has seven to ten percent effectiveness, which is honestly a lot like this is way more than I think it does because it's just not enough. The best thing you can do is hit the gym, be healthy, eat healthy foods. That's gonna change the way that you look. Focus on that. Or you can just go to that place, suite 106 for the Academy of Oral Facial Myofunctional Therapy and see if they can change your face with their thumbs. I just don't really understand. So I'm gonna give thumb pulling a C tier. If there are way more risks than benefits, so I would stay away from that and focus on other things are actually going to give you results as opposed to just trying to get a quick fix out of this. I spent an entire month exploring techniques and exercises to develop hunter eyes. Hunter eyes. Yeah, I've been seeing this one a lot. This one is crazy interesting to me. And this guy's kind of funny. So when I refer to this term hunter eyes, am I talking about developing night vision so that I can catch out as well called eyelid polling? Oh, eyelid pulling man. The eyelid every once in a while over time, this might lead to eyelid being sticking out a little bit and you're gonna do this hooded eyelid. You know what's funny, when you get older, a lot of people have a cosmetic surgery that actually cuts off a lot of that extra skin on top of their eyes. It's called an upper bleph, and they have a lower bleph as well. But an upper bleph is when you have skin hanging over your eye and you have a hard time opening your eyes fully so you can see. So old people, I guess, have hunter eyes. Look at that. All you gotta do is just wait 20, 30 years and you're gonna have hunter eyes too. And if you're pulling your eyelids to actually stretch the skin above your eyes, that is so risky and so bad for you in the future when you actually have issues with extra skin above your eyes and you have to get an upper bluff. I think, and yes, hunter eyes, there's something attractive about that, people would say. Right, maybe it's, they look more dangerous. They look more suspicious or something like that, but there's really nothing wrong with different shapes of eyes. So I wouldn't focus on this. I'm gonna give this one a B tier, but in reality, just be happy with the eyes that you have. Just make sure that you can see out of your eyes and there's no skin literally hanging over your eyes that your eyelids aren't getting stretched out for you to do this. I think that's very dangerous. Last thing I want from you is to have to do a surgery earlier than you have to the upper bleph just because you've been pulling on your eyelids. So please be careful. Look, and there are probably some exercises that can help improve your facial expressions. I think the best thing that you can do for hunter eyes is look into the mirror and practice the way that you are looking at people. Practice your gaze, you know, and just learn how your face works, how you're moving your face, how your muscles are working your face. That is the best way to get hunter eyes. It's not through cosmetic surgery. It's not through exercises. I think it's really gonna be down to you understanding how your face works and using that to your advantage. Instead of talking like this, just bring your eyebrows a little bit closer together. Don't do it too much because otherwise you're actually gonna get some wrinkles and that's it. And look, I get it. Quick fixes, instant gratification, it all sounds really good, right? Especially when social media is telling you that you can improve your looks, that you can go from a six to a 10 just like this overnight by putting banana peel all over your face. That's not what's gonna get you there. The truth is that obsessing over these looks, maxing hacks isn't what's going to get you to actually maximize your looks. Funny enough, if you genuinely want to improve your looks, the answer is and always will be consistent effort. Hit the gym, be active, eat nutritious food, get enough sleep and recovery. Have a simple skincare routine and build habits that actually push you forward. These results aren't instant, but they're real, they're sustainable and they're life changing. So stop focusing on these fads and focus on what's actually you're gonna make a big difference in your life. Your health and your looks, that guys is gonna be the best way for you to actually change your life. Make sure to join my community to elevate your looks through real habits like learning how to dress, how to do your grooming and your hair and fitness, right? I hope you guys enjoyed the video.

        "transcript": " The warmer season is upon us and I'm so pumped. So today I'm putting together six stylish outfits, wearing different brands and including alternatives in a description to make it easy for you to steal these looks on your own budget. Copy them item by item, change them up into your own style. I don't care. I just wanna help you look your absolute best. So let's get started. The first outfit is the perfect look for spring. The jacket is from Reese and the color is just stunning. They called it Air Force Blue. It's lightweight, which makes it ideal for those days that started out warm, but then they get cold at night. It has practical pockets. The double zipper feature makes it more versatile. And you can bet that you'll see me wearing this jacket a lot. I wore it to Mike Thurston's podcast that's coming out soon, and it was a hit. The off-white jeans are from Suitsupply. They have a straight fit, which means snug around the thighs and then looser around the calves. To me, that's the ideal fit. You can get a lot of wears from these jeans. They match pretty much anything and everything. Underneath the Reese jacket, I'm wearing a textured t-shirt from Zara. You can wear a normal cotton tee, but I appreciate clothes that have an X factor, like the texture on this t-shirt, which just elevates it, right? The sneakers are from Aurelion. I just got them this season. They have an old money vibe to them, but without being the usual boring sneakers. The color, the texture, I mean, 10 out of 10, Aurelion really nailed this shoe design. For accessories, I'm wearing my Omega Seamaster, No Time to Die. The vintage looking dial is perfect for this outfit. This is by far my favorite Omega. I don't take this bracelet off, so a lot of people ask me about it. It just has the three types of gold, so yellow, rose, and white gold. Cartier will replace the string any time you want, so if it ever rips or starts to look old, or if you just want a different color, like blue or red for a specific trip, just walk into a Cartier store, and they will replace it immediately for you for free. It's expensive because it's Cartier, but there are a lot of similar bracelets out there, like this one from David Uriman, This one from Maggiore, or this one from Dex in South. The sunglasses are from TVDI wear. The specific style is called Welte Echo. They're made in Italy, they feel really nice. And I really like the detail here, the nose bridge. I just think it looks really nice on my face shape as well. So I really like this. Now, if you like this first outfit, I have five more. And you'll be surprised because they're all stylish, but they're all very different from each other. So please do me a favor and hit that subscribe button. I know it sounds stupid, but it actually really helps my channel. This video isn't sponsored. I'm posting to help you look your best. So if you could do that for me, I would really appreciate it. Move it on to outfit number two. Now I wanted to give you guys who like light wash denim, a good outfit option. And this is as easy as it gets. The denim is from Everlane. It's their loose straight denim. The fit is flawless. You know, they're really comfortable. Now this might be my favorite sweater right now. This is the Brown Ribbed Half-Zip in wool cashmere from Suitsupply. Guys, this is such an amazing sweater. It's classy, it stands out without being obnoxious and it's wool cashmere. So anyone who touches it will immediately feel how soft and how high quality this is. The kicks are from Converse, you can never go wrong with these, right? They have really cool details like the mismatched line on the sides and the sole is thicker. So you know what that means. I am no longer five nine with these. I'm basically six feet tall, minus an inch or two. And that is men's height math right there. But hey, if you're a tall dude and you don't wanna wear something like that, If you don't need the extra height, then you know, leave some for us short Kings. A good alternative is something like the new balance is 550. These are the Amelion Door Collab. I've been wearing these a ton. I really like the colorway. The sunglasses are from Salt Optics. The model is called Fuller in the whiskey colorway, which I really like just because they go with pretty much anything. Now they're sold out, but I will list some alternatives for you guys below. And I'm wearing my Cartier Tank Louis. This is a classic watch that I just can't get enough of. Now, because this is a simple outfit, I also wanted to add a brown leather duffel to add a cool detail. And of course, to make it practical, if you're going somewhere and you need to carry your essentials, this duffel is from Beckett Simonin. The leather feels really soft, it's high quality. And if you don't wanna carry a duffel around, another good option is this Coach backpack. I've had this for years, but they still sell a new version of this backpack on their website, which I'll list below. I feel like this outfit gives off a stylish 90s dad vibe, you know? And I mean that in a good way. It's simple, it's elegant, it's comfortable, you really can't go wrong with it. This next outfit might be my favorite. And the funny thing is, it's all from the same brand. Can you guess which brand it is? And if you guessed suit supply, then you're right. I mean, look at this linen jacket. The details, this sand color, it's lightweight, it's simple, but it's elegant. And I'm not the only one who likes it this much because it's sold out immediately. So keep an eye out for a restock. Underneath the jacket, I'm wearing an off-white knitted tank top. This is an easy layering piece. I think every guy should own this for the warmer seasons. It just makes it easy for you to layer something underneath. Now the white pants have a relaxed fit that I really appreciate. It gives the outfit a nice flowy silhouette. It's something that you could wear to an elevated summer event or you can wear it in a resort in Mexico. Now, typically I don't like these types of sandals, but these are a different story. These aren't your average slides or sandals that you see guys wearing. The leather looks great, the design is stylish, and you can dress them up like I did with this outfit. I'm rocking again the Cartier Tank Louis and the sunglasses I got from Yes Glasses. I conveniently had my prescription added to them. I like the smoked lens, the black frames to match the black sandals, bringing this whole look together. And if you want help putting outfits together, check out my private community Men's Image Lab. We have over 6,000 guys there helping each other look their absolute best. Now I love being able to see your outfits, being able to interact with you. I'm gonna leave a link below, so make sure to go and check it out. Moving on to outfit number four. I wanted to give you guys a black outfit. This is an outfit that you can wear during the day and transition to nighttime. The zip sweater is from Perry Ellis. It's thin enough that you can wear in a cool summer night, for example. And you can zip it up or down to show more or less of the underlayer so you can get creative with how this looks. The knit t-shirt underneath, the black pants, and the loafers are from Suit Supply. Again, not sponsored. I've just really been liking their new collection. They crushed this one. Also, my personal style has evolved into a more mature, classic look and suit supply just nails that look. Now what sets this specific outfit apart are the accessories. The watch is an Omega Speedmaster dark side of the moon. I haven't worn this one in a while, but it was the perfect fit for this black outfit. The pair of bag is a beauty. The black leather details stand out, elevate the bag. The one issue I have with this bag is the fact that I've only used it a handful of times and it's already pretty dirty. You know, I pride myself in taking care of my stuff so it's annoying when that happens, but you can always clean it. It's not a deal breaker. It's still an amazing bag. Now, there's a hidden gem in this outfit. Ice Plurged on the most incredible pair of sunglasses that I have ever owned. These limited edition Jackmari mage sunglasses. They only made 150 of them. This is number 107, and I spent way too much money on them, but they feel crazy high quality and every detail is top notch. You know, you can start to pick up on these details when you get up close. You know, I don't know if they're worth the money, but they are very, very, very nice. A little too expensive, so I'm gonna leave a more affordable option for you guys in the description below. And if you're new here, this channel is all about men's fashion, hair, grooming. I consider it my mission to help you maximize your looks and your habits to make sure that you live a better life.

Now, for this next look, I wanted to give you guys something very different from the rest. This is a simple casual outfit that you can wear to go out with your friends or you can wear it on a lunch day. This brushed denim jacket is gorgeous. I got it over a month ago and every time I wear, I get compliments and people ask where I got it from. Well, I got it from Zara. I'm wearing it right now and I just love the way that it looks. I love the deep denim color as well, the deep wash, as opposed to something that's a little bit lighter. I also got the green shirt underneath from Zara because I really like the way they styled it on the Zara products page. It goes to show don't be scared of just copying exactly what you see on the brand's website. They have professional stylists putting these looks together. So why not steal these looks? The t-shirt says born and raised in Rio. It says it in Portuguese. You guys know that I was born and raised in Brazil. I wasn't born and raised in Rio, but I like the tee and I got it from Zara as well. The jeans are from Madewell and I'll admit these are too long on me. I haven't hemmed them yet. So I just rolled them in for this video. I'm definitely gonna get them tailored, They look really nice as is. The sneakers are from a brand that I highly recommend, Arnie. They have modern sneakers with clean silhouettes. They're very high quality, fair pricing, and they have a ton of colorways. I own four or five of them and I wear them a lot. The watch here is the Omega C Master, no time to die again. And the glasses are from TVDI wear. The welt echoes again just this time in a different colorway from the others that I wore earlier in this video. Okay, so the main attraction for this next outfit is the crochet polo. I mean, a lot of guys might think that they can't pull this off, but I urge you, if that's you, just try it. Just give it a shot and see how you look wearing it. I recommend sizing up for this because it's a casual, warm season polo, so it needs to look more relaxed. I even decided to go with a beachy, relaxed hairstyle to match that energy. The pants are also following that same relaxed silhouette, even though they're more dressy. You can see they're a little bit longer, they flow really well. The brown suede loafers match perfectly because of the earth tones here and they're playing together really nicely. The watch I chose for this outfit is the Protect Philippe Aquanaut. You guys know how much I love this watch and how much it means to me. The brown strap is a perfect addition to this earth tone look. And if you wanna dress this up, you can always wear the suit jacket. This is a double breasted jacket. The entire look is from Suit Supply, surprise, surprise. I thought you guys would appreciate how you can get everything from one shopping cart. Comment below which outfit was your favorite and don't forget to check out my private community made to help you elevate your looks. The link is in the description below. I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Today I'm taking millionaire entrepreneur, Eman Gadji, shopping here in New York City. His outfits are usually worth thousands of dollars, but today's challenge is to replicate his style for under 500 bucks. Let's see if we can do it. [\"Money Aesthetic Style\"] We have this like old money aesthetic style going. Everybody got to feel like talks about Eman style, old money aesthetic style. I wanna ask you first, why do you wear old money versus street style, for example? I think old money kind of became a thing in the last few years, it's kind of a buzzword, like new money, old money. I guess growing up in London, you don't want your clothing to be your entire personality. But honestly, when I first started making good money, I was never crazy into logos and stuff like that, but there's a few little pieces and bits of all is my friends from London are you wearing? Like, they're like, this is not happening. I see you wear sometimes some fun sneakers though, some Travis. Yeah, mix it up. Yeah. I think you should have fun with your style. Like we were one of our offices yesterday and like half the employees don't even wear shoes. So it's just like, that's not really like the vibe. So you kind of need to know your environment, know where you are. And I feel like the way I dress, I just feel like anywhere I go, it's not going to be too over the top, but it's not going to be underdressed as well. Like it's a happy medium. How much does this outfit cost, for example? I think shoes are like a K. Okay. Trousers I have no idea they're from my tailor. Custom made. So I have no idea. You know? This, I don't know. Laurel maybe like three. So thousands of dollars for this outfit. We're going to replicate a very similar style for you. So we'll probably just do shirt, pants, no jacket, because we're gonna keep it under $500 for you guys watching. So, that's the challenge. That's the challenge. Let's do it. All right. So obviously with Suit Supply, you can get, you know, so many different pieces here that are gonna be similar to this. I mean, just looking at the style, right? It's very similar to what you're wearing now. So how about we start with tops? Is there anything here that like catches your eyes? Would you ever wear something like this? I don't know how I feel about the fishnet. That was probably a myth. Too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to find your boundaries right now. It's like a nice fruity country club outfit. It's a linen bomber. It's really nice. Really light. Perfect for Dubai weather, because it's linen, so very breathable. Similar to what you have on right now, right? So this could be good. We will skip the fishnet. Yeah, for the best. What's your favorite fashion brand that you wear, typically? If I'm being honest, Zenia, Loro. I'm sorry, get a little off it. Yeah. If I'm being honest, so I had this, a gift of Kings from Loro Piano. It's like a 3000 dollar shirt, it's ridiculous. But this like just fits perfect. You know when a shirt just fits perfect? This hits different. Yeah. I'm not joking, I've ruined maybe 10 of them. Like, but sending it to dry cleaning as well. And they're like, oh, you know what needs to be treated correctly, this is how I told them. I was like, okay, where is a place that could treat it? And there was only one place in Abu Dhabi. So I sent it there, they still messed it up. So I've ruined like 10 of these shirts now. And that's the thing sometimes with luxury too, like it needs to last, you know what I mean? If you're paying the premium, it needs to last. Like you're spending 3K on a top. So then there's like alternatives like this, this place called, I don't know if you're Derek Rose. Yeah, I've heard of that. So they make pajamas. But I start wearing the pajama t-shirts as like a regular t-shirt, because they look exactly like the Gifts of Kings. And I granted, I probably get maybe 10 wears out of it. And then I throw them away, which I know is a little wasteful, but. But you know when, you just know when like it just doesn't. It's not working. It just doesn't, yeah. Is that from also dry cleanies, I think, or? Just like wear and tear. I just think wear and tear. Also, I don't take care of myself. These are items. Like in the nice way, also, I'm not gonna have no meaning to me. Like, I'm not gonna like sit and like fold everything and like try to like, oh, I can't get a stain on it or I can't scratch my watch. It's like, I'm like that. I'm for sure like that. I'm like, I don't wanna stain my stuff. I don't wanna scratch my watch. And then you get the first scratch and you're like, all right, whatever. Now it's old, it's used, it's all good. but I tried to like maintain my stuff. So I don't lose things. I lost a pair of like Louis Vuitton sunglasses like a couple of weeks ago and I was pissed. I was, why did that happen? And I'm like, having a crisis, you know? And I'm like, you know what? Let's go buy new ones, whatever. I don't know if you know about one of my businesses. I'm in the eyewear business. Yeah. And that's one of the reasons like, I love that business so much. It's cause people lose their glasses all the time, bro. Might as well have a subscription for it. Yeah. Honestly, and if someone will like spill something on a $500 shirt, but they're not in a rush to go buy a new pair, Like they're not bothered. But if someone loses their $500 glass, they go buy it straight away. Like they can't live without it. It's like a part of, it's like on your face too. It's a part of your personality. You know, are these from your brand? Or yeah, yeah. Let's check them out. What do you guys think? Looking fair. Yeah, all the heads nodded. Yeah, that's right. So I noticed you wear mostly chinos, trousers. I'm assuming you get them tailored. Do you wear jeans at all or no? Occasionally I just have larger legs, like a footballer's legs. I do, yeah. Jeans just never really fit that well on me. Nowadays, the good thing is like the relaxed trend makes it a little bit easier for guys that have thicker legs, you know, to fit into everything. Like these are pretty cool because they're more straight, relaxed fit. I rarely wear jeans. This is actually like a rare sighting. There's a way to make it look classy in a way, right? If you like have a top that's classy, belt, boots, with this top and this jacket, I feel like it probably wouldn't be a match. I feel like you wouldn't really wear like light denim though, probably dark. I don't really wear light colors in general, if I'm being honest. I kind of stick to my grades, navy, slack. Maybe that's also just because time has gone on. I think especially in the last six, 12 months, I'm like, throw on something I know that's acceptable. And I've actually started to put less and less effort into my outfits. How do you plan your outfits when you're traveling to New York, for example? When I'm traveling in general, I'll just try to stick with neutrals, basically. Because I'm like, I can't go wrong. Whereas obviously back in Dubai or in London, where I've got like my full wardrobe, you know, you can be a little bit more funky with it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because the worst thing is bringing an item while you're traveling, and then you got like one wear out of it, and then like it doesn't fit with anything else you're wearing. I plan my outfits on like a Google Doc. Really? I'm extreme about it because like it's my job. Yes, your line of work. So obviously like I know that I'm shooting, I'll be on camera, whatever, and people want to see my outfit. But I know that that's like, that's going overboard for the majority of people. Random question, do you take a portable steamer with you everywhere you go? I don't. No? I don't. But I usually only stay at places that have a steamer with where I go. You know what I bring? I bring out a water bottle spray and I'll put like D-Rinkler into that water bottle spray and then I'll just use that. Usually like you spray that and you just kind of go like this, loosen the fabric and you don't need to steam it. Typically, yeah. Not every fabric, but the majority. Like linen for example, it's impossible to travel with, you know, because you just have to really iron it. Let's stress them outfits on. Yeah, cool. So Iman's changing right now and I actually was able to find him an outfit that's really similar to the outfit that he came in with. So I think you guys are gonna like this one because it literally is his style, but just way more affordable and it looks really great. All right, man, let's see it. Okay, now that's like an Iman Ghazi style. That's exactly what you came in with. Is this like the most affordable outfit you've ever worn in your life? No, no, no, no, I wear affordable stuff. No, this is perfect. 120 for the Polo, 130 for the pants, 199 for the sneakers. So you're under 500 with all three items. So I think it looks really good, very much you. And the guys at home can copy this pretty easily. 450 for the Hoshibang? Not bad. Not bad. All right. So we got the first fit under 500. I know you said you didn't like the fishnet. It's funny that you call it a fishnet. It's crochet, you know, it's not that. So I'm gonna give you white pants with the belt and then the crochet polo. And it's a nice summer look, breezy perfect for Dubai, for example. All right. Tell me what you think. I'll give you the shoes. The shoes are not gonna keep this under 500 bucks, so it'd only be these three pieces that under $500, but just to give you guys an idea of what you could wear with an outfit like this. So he's in there right now, and he's got this outfit that he's probably very uncomfortable in, but I think it's gonna look good, and it's definitely more of a casual outfit. I wouldn't say it's that E-Mon style, but slightly outside of this comfort zone, and I think it's gonna look good. E-Mon, you ready? Yep. All right, let's see it. Okay, what do you think man? I mean, I think it looks really good. I know it's outside of your comfort zone maybe, but It's like a nice fruity country club outfit. That's kind of true. Do you wear white pants? It depends where I am in Europe. But I think it fits you really well. And the top, I know it's outside of your comfort zone. And you can see a little bit of your nipples. If you guys zoom in. Just like, yeah, just bring it right in. I actually own this shirt, but it's buttoned all the way down. and I wear it out, I just can't take any flash photography in it because then it's like, then you can really see it. Feel like I need a toothpick and pomade. Honestly, and slick your hair back. Yeah, just with the pomade. Top is 159, pants are 199, and then the belt is 99. So we're under 500 without the loafers, which is a great look if you guys are looking for something that's summer, spring casual, if you're comfortable with the crochet, of course. So for this next outfit, I wanted to give him little bit more layers on his outfit. So we have a tank top, you have a cardigan, which he saw my cardigan earlier and he's like, maybe I'll try a cardigan. His is thinner, better for summer and spring. And then we have tan trousers as well with a really nice belt detail. So it's a little bit more outside of his usual style since we already have one that's exactly like his style, one that's like way outside of his comfort zone. This one sits in between. And I think it's gonna look really good. It's very classy, easy to wear. Come on, are you ready? All right, yeah, everything fits really well. Looks good, earth tones. How do you feel in it? Yeah, cozy, flowy. Flowy, yeah, exactly. Comfortable. Good for a spring, summer. Would you ever wear something like this or is this like two outside of your comfort zone? This works, to be honest. I think I'd probably go for a bit of a thicker cardigan. Thicker cardigan, so it's not as tight on you. Yeah, exactly. Something more like this. Everything here besides the shoes comes out to about $450 with the price on screen, but it looks good. Anyone can copy this. And I like that you mentioned that you would do a different cardigan because with the tank, you can just throw anything over it and honestly it looks good as that layer on top of it. If you had to wear this somewhere, tell me, where would you wear this to? Anywhere in Europe. Europe. Yeah, or lunch in Dubai. All right, I expect an Instagram photo in this outfit having lunch in Dubai. There we go, I'll tag you in the story. Yeah, exactly. Bro, thanks for honestly being a trooper and just playing along and even trying the fishnet. I appreciate that. I think it's like, you see someone online and you really don't know what they're like, right? But when you meet them in person, I mean, you're such a cool guy, your team is awesome. So being able to meet you here in New York has been a pleasure. I appreciate you showing us around. Thank you, man. And you were so cool with just trying everything. So easy to get along with. This is the Rio E. Mungadze here, everyone. Make sure to go check him out and his eyewear brand as well. I'm gonna leave all of his channels below. I'm sure you guys have seen it already. Thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time."

        "transcript": " Most guys who try growing out their hair give up way too soon and you know exactly why the dreaded awkward stage hits. Your hair starts looking weird and you bail out. Well today my promise to you is very simple. If you stick around and watch this full video I'm going to teach you exactly how to conquer the awkward phase and how to finally get that epic longer hairstyle that you've been dreaming about. It's the kind of hair that grabs attention from women and envy from other guys. And first off let me clear a huge myth right now. You have to trim your hair monthly to make it grow faster. But guys, that's total nonsense. Your hair grows from the root, not to the tip. So cutting it down doesn't affect how quickly it grows at all. And science proves this. Hair grows at about one inch per month, no matter what. So when people tell you to trim often, they're just suggesting it to keep your hair looking fresh without the split ends. But here's the catch. If you're serious about growing out your hair, if you want it to be longer, don't trim your hair every month. I didn't touch scissors for six months when I was growing my hair out. And it made a massive difference. You're obviously gonna hit your goals way quicker if you decide to not cut and just wait a little bit longer. Even though you shouldn't be trimming every month, you do eventually need some maintenance. Every four to six months, get a small trim to eliminate those split ends and to keep your hair looking healthy because split ends make your hair look unhealthy or even dirty. So while getting trims won't make your hair grow faster, they do help make your hair look better, which makes the awkward phase a little bit less awkward and easier to get through. You gotta have to choose to not cut your hair at all so you get to have longer hair faster, but it won't look as good because you have split ends. Or if you're okay waiting a little bit longer for it to grow because you trim it every few months to keep it looking healthier. I went for something in between personally. I let mine grow for about six months before I got a trim to me. I just wanted to get to the man bun stage as quickly as possible. So I sacrificed the health of my hair for that extra length. The second thing you need to do is you need a clear goal. Do you want classic vibes like Brad Pitt and Troy? Are you thinking wild and free like Jason Momoa? Or maybe you just want it a little bit longer, some effortless style like Timothy Chalamet's look. Knowing exactly what you're aiming for is gonna help you power through that awkward stage. When I first grew my hair out, I had zero plants. I looked like a mix between the Beatles and early Justin Bieber. It wasn't a good look. But once you know your end goal, then you just have that vision, right? And you need to know your hair type. Is it thick like Kit Harington's in Game of Thrones, or is it finer like Learne out of the Caprious? This will define how you style it and manage it along the way. And let's be honest, the awkward phase sucks. Your hair is too long to do your usual hairstyle and to make it neat, but too short to tie it back into a bun or maybe it's just kind of sticking out on the sides. And you see celebrities go through the same exact thing. Think Steve Harrington in Stranger Things, season one. That's kind of the vibe. But here's how you survive it. The first thing you need to do is to invest in cool hats and beanies that you're gonna wear to hide your hair once in a while. Because look, it's gonna be a lifesaver when your hair just refuses to cooperate, which happens all the time when your hair's a little bit longer. Plus, this is when products become your best friend. So use some sea salt spray or some styling cream to tame that chaos and to make you look intentional rather than just like a caveman rather than unkept. Be patient, fight the urge to cut it all because you're gonna get that urge every single day when you look at your hair in the mirror and you're like, who is this man? Why is my hair just not working with me right now? It's so hard to manage. You have to work through it. The truth is that growing out your hair can be stressful. It can be tough on your confidence, but it's doable. And speaking of confidence, shout out to our sponsor today, BetterHelp. They can help you regain confidence by connecting you to a professional therapist so you can organize your mind. They offer therapists specialized in any area that you need help with so you can overcome anything holding your back. In therapy, you get to learn more about yourself, why you act a certain way, why you get mad at certain situations, why you're socially shy, you're anxious, why you have a hard time asking for help or making friends or communicating with your girlfriend. That's why therapy is so good for you. It gives you a safe space to talk about these things that, let's be honest, men don't really share. It's not something that we tend to talk about, not even with our closest friends sometimes. You sign up online, they match you with a therapist according to your needs, and then you can schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to go in person. It's discreet and it's on your schedule. This is the most practical way of talking to a professional and getting real advice about what's going on in your life. You get to talk to your therapist about topics that you don't talk to anyone else about. Your therapist is another person on your side, on your team, helping you become a better man. And of course, you can always stop if you don't like it or swap to a different therapist if you don't like the first one, which better help offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. So click that first link in my description. It's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta and you even get a discount on your first month. Now going back to your hair, another mistake is washing your hair too often. I used to do this all the time. I use the typical two in one shampoo. I wash my hair every single day with it, but wash in daily strips away the natural oils and it leaves your hair dry. It leaves it looking brittle and even feeling brittle. Two or three times a week is enough and always use conditioner. You can use conditioner in water every single day, by the way, always. Conditioner makes your hair softer, it makes it healthier, and it makes it easier to manage. And a pro tip, this is something that I have to tell you guys because I feel like no guys do this. Once a week, you have to treat yourself to a deep conditioning mask. It's a game changer, trust me. Most guys have never even tried this, but if you're growing out your hair, this is life changing. It makes a huge difference in the way that your hair feels, the way that it looks, and most importantly, it makes it more manageable. So you can style it easier so it looks even better. I'm telling you, just do one mask a week. It can be a coconut oil mask. It can be an avocado oil mask, or just buy one from Amazon or CVS or whatever. It's so, so easy. And look, these products all help. There's one important step that most guys forget about. Your diet actually matters a lot. Eating a healthy diet, getting enough protein, vitamins and minerals is key. But if you want faster growth, you have to give your body some extra help. And my secret weapon for that is biotin gummies. So biotin boosts your hair growth, makes your hair stronger, and it even improves your nails and your skin. So it's like an all around great thing to just pump your body with. Plus gummies taste pretty good. You're like a treat. It's an easy habit to add to your routine. With two gummies a day, you're getting all the vitamins and nutrients that your hair needs to grow faster, to grow stronger, and it tastes pretty good. It's like a little daily treat that I actually look forward to having as opposed to swallowing a bunch of pills. Where I see a lot of guys going wrong too is choosing the wrong products for their hair type. Look, quality hair products made specifically for your hair type make all the difference. If you have flat, thin hair, for example, a thickening spray is gonna add volume and life to your hair because when it gets longer, trust me, if you have flat hair already, it's gonna get even more flat. It's gonna really weigh it down because it's a longer hair strand and it's gonna look flat, it's gonna look lifeless. So you need that thickening spray or volumizing mousse. Now, a lightweight cream is gonna keep it in place without weighing it down. And if you have thick hair, a heavy clay is gonna help you manage it because thick hair tends to be harder to manage and harder to control. And look guys, cheap products from drugstores, they make your hair look greasy, they make it look unhealthy. So make sure that you're getting high quality products. Okay, so now let's say your hair is getting there, it's finally growing, it's looking better. You're gonna have to learn how to manage it and how to style it properly. And it takes a few tries to get it right, like blow drying in with a round brush. It takes up a little bit of practice, right? It makes a massive difference though in the end. When my hair was long, I remember I was pretty good with styling my hair because I was doing YouTube tutorials back in the day already, but then my hair grew longer and I was like, I have no idea what I'm doing. So I had to watch tutorials. I had to ask my hairstylist, hey, how do I do this? It changes everything. When your hair is longer, it looks different. My hair was a little bit more straight, but rather than wavy. So I had to relearn how to style my hair. Be patient, learn how to use tools like a blow dryer, a round brush, and your hair's gonna look so, so much better. Growing out your hair isn't just, you know, let's just let it grow, let's just go with the wind. Follow the tips from today's videos. These myths that I busted, set these clear goals, survive the awkward stage, get the minimal trims just for the dead ends. Don't be cutting it way too short because it's gonna take too long. Make sure that you're applying conditioner. Get the biotin gummies and learn how to style your hair properly. Do this and trust me this year you're going to be the guy that everyone points to saying that's the kind of hairstyle that I want. Let me know in the comments below what kind of hairstyle you're going for this year and don't forget to subscribe so you can learn more about your hair and your style. I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how you can completely change your life in the next 60 days. I'm not talking about a small change. I'm talking about leveling up every area that truly matters to you. And I've used this simple three step process to hit huge milestones in my life, like leaving my full time job at Google to work for myself and pursue my passion. Building successful seven figure brands like Portie series and creating the kind of lifestyle that I once only dreamed about. Today, I'm going to teach you that exact process. Have you ever felt stuck? Like you're just going through the motions day after day and nothing seems to ever change. I think we've all been there. I'm about to help you break out of that cycle because otherwise one year will go by and you're gonna be exactly where you are today. And the framework that we're using is very straightforward. I call it EVE, evaluate, visualize and execute. Let's jump in. The very first thing you need to do is evaluate your current life. Take an honest look at your current situation. The idea is very simple. Before you can improve, you need to clearly see what's actually happening, what's going on in your life. And to do this, we're gonna use the help from my recent favorite book, Five Types of Wealth by Sahil Bloom, and the five types of wealth are gonna be time wealth, which is freedom and flexibility in your schedule, social wealth, which is relationships, connections, your network, mental wealth, which is knowledge, skills, mindset, physical wealth, which is your health, your fitness, your appearance, and financial wealth, which is money, savings, investments. So I'm going to grab a notebook and write down these five categories. then rate yourself from one to 10 in each area based on your current satisfaction. And be brutally honest here. This isn't the time for sugarcoating. If you don't have a clear picture of where you are right now, where you stand, you don't know where you're going. You don't know where you need to go. So when I first did this, I realized that my mental, physical, and financial wealth were strong. But because I work a lot, my time in social wealth needed major improvement. It was an eye-opener for me, and that's why I like this book so much. It helped me set crystal clear goals moving forward. Now, once you have your ratings, you're gonna take a moment and you're gonna think, okay, which area bothers me the most and which area, if improved, could completely transform my life because this leads us directly into step two. And what this does is it gives you an honest look at your current situation. People underestimate the power of evaluating where you are in life with clear measurements. So these ratings that you just gave yourself, that's where you are in life. And that's just the truth. There's a quote you should remember for the rest of your life. You can't manage what you can't measure. How are you supposed to manage your finances if you're not measuring them? How are you supposed to manage your weight if you're not measuring it? It makes sense, right? You can't manage what you can't measure. So now that you have your measurements, your scores, it's time to move on to the next step, visualize. This is where you create a vision for your future self. The reason why most people never truly change their lives is simple. They don't have a clear enough picture of where they wanna go. And if your vision isn't exciting, isn't something that you look forward to, then there's nothing pulling you forward towards that vision. So here's how we're going to do this. You need to set aside 20 to 30 minutes when you're not distracted. Put your phone on do not disturb and focus. Today's world is full of distractions, right? So you need to minimize that for this specific exercise. Research shows that an average person actually spends over an hour a day on small distractions. A good hack to keep distractions away is to use the Opera Air desktop browser. You can see how different this browser is from the others. It's designed to bring calm and focus to your life. I mean, just think about what you can get done with an extra hour per day of no distraction or seven hours per week. It really adds up and it makes a huge difference in your efficiency. Immediately, you can see that the browser design is made to be calming, it's made to be stress-free. They added features like the Boost feature, which gives you more than 20 soundscapes to choose from. I personally like lo-fi music and I can play it right from the browser. So I don't waste any time looking for music that keeps me focused. Then every time you open the browser, where you see a daily inspirational quote so that you can start your day with a positive mindset. And they have a break feature, so it reminds you to take breaks from work so I can stay focused. Right? Sometimes we forget that we can't really perform at the highest level 24 seven. We need to take a moment to recharge so we can attack again. And you can choose your favorite type of break and recharging. Some people might like breathing, some people like meditation. Others like myself might prefer the stretches. It's just a good reminder to take care of your body and your mind during the day, especially if you're like me and you're looking at your computer for most of the day. It has a simple clutter-free interface which was made to reduce distractions and to provide a calm, focused and stress-free online experience. Oh, and by the way, Opera Air is absolutely free. You can download it right now from the link in the description. Now let's go back to that exercise. Imagine yourself three years from now and ask yourself questions like, where do you live? City, type of home, the neighborhood. How's your physical health? Are you strong? Are you fit? Are you playing any sports? What are you doing professionally? Are you fulfilled and excited about your career? Who are you spending your time with? What's your social life like? What hobbies and passions have you picked up? How are you spending your free time? And what does a typical perfect day look like for you? You know, when I did this exercise not too long ago, I envisioned myself in the best shape of my life, my brand forte series tripled in revenue and in size, and we're helping millions of men improve their looks and confidence. My relationships were strong. I was hosting dinner with interesting people, traveling the world with my wife, and seeing my family way more often than I see them now. And having this crystal clear picture, it completely changed how I approach my daily decisions. For one, I can't see my family as often as I would like to unless I move out of New York City or move them here. So immediately I know something has to change in the next three years for me to actually achieve that vision. So it just gives you a lot to think about. If I don't visualize that, right? If I don't know that I wanna spend more time with my family, I'm never really gonna make that happen because it's a big move. So if you're more of a visual person, by the way, you can try making a vision board. You can go to Pinterest, Instagram, pull some images that represent your goals, put them together in your phone, your computer. Every time you look at this vision board, you should get pumped. You should be excited. This emotional connection is important because now you're staying motivated. Now you're staying consistent because you see the vision. You see the light at the end of the tunnel. You need to be excited about it. Otherwise you're not really hungry for it. You don't really care. You don't even know what it looks like. You don't even know where you're going. How can you be excited about not knowing where you're going? That doesn't make sense, right? Now that you have your vision, that's not enough. Let's get practical. The third step is choosing your one big quest for the next 60 days. Look, you probably have a bunch of goals, right? And trust me, that's natural. I have a ton of goals as well, but here's the thing. If you chase everything, you end up achieving nothing significant. So to truly transform your life in a meaningful way, you need laser-like focus. You're gonna choose just two quests for the next 60 days. one for your personal life, let's say health, relationships, hobbies, self-care, and one for your professional life, that's your career, your finances, your business. And here's exactly how you're gonna write down your quests. And trust me, this specific format is gonna help you. My main quest for the next 60 days is to fill this out. Okay, the next one is, this is incredibly important to me because in order to complete this quest, I commit that in the next 60 days I will accomplish, and then you put your specific measurable goals. This excites me because fill this out with an emotionally compelling reason, something that you're very excited about. And to ensure that I achieve this, I will, and then you put the action steps to maintain accountability. So let me show you a real example of how this looks. If your personal goal was to strengthen your physical wealth, for example, my main personal quest is to reach my fitness goal of getting to 180 pounds with 14% body fat. And in order to complete this quest, I'll hit the gym four days a week, track my macros daily and practice yoga once a week for flexibility. This excites me because hitting this goal would give me a massive sense of achievement, confidence and physical energy. To make sure I stick to it, I'm going to post regular updates on my socials to keep myself accountable. And let's be real, it's going to be embarrassing if I don't follow through. You see how specific that is? You can't just lie to yourself about whether or not you accomplish this. This is clear. And the clearer you are, the easier it's going to be to actually do it for your second quest. Do the same thing, but this time you're going to choose a professional focused goal. Maybe it's about improving your finances, starting a new job, or even spending less money on alcohol, whatever it is, make it clear, make it actionable, just like your personal quest. And I have a few prompts to help you pick your life quest. What's one thing that would dramatically improve your financial situation if achieved? What's one professional goal that you've always thought about but never fully pursued? If you have one hour each day dedicated to something that you've always wanted to do, what would make the biggest impact? After you pick your two quests, you might be thinking, but what about all the other stuff that I want to achieve, right? Because we all have so many goals. Well, those can be your side quests. You know, they're important, but they're not critical. Don't overload yourself. This is about prioritizing your side quests. I'm sure they're fun. I'm sure they're great. But your main quests needs all of your focus, all of your energy and all of your attention right now. Going back to distractions, there are so many distractions nowadays that you end up wasting time on side quests. When the reality is that to truly move the needle in the right direction, you just need to work on the most important quests first. Forget the rest, focus on the things that make a big, big difference in your life. And here's one more key point to remember, maybe the most important point of this video. Changing your life isn't about doing it perfectly. It's about doing it consistently. You're going to have days where you feel motivated and then days where you don't feel like doing anything at all. That's completely normal. But if you keep coming back to these quests, if you stay clear on your vision and you remind yourself why you're doing this, In just 60 days, you're going to see a totally different life ahead of you. So I challenge you right now, pause the video and write down your two main quests. Don't just watch and move on. If you're serious about transforming your life, take this step right now and I guarantee it's going to be worth it. Drop a comment below and tell me what your requests are to make sure that you're committing to them for the next 60 days. And if you found this video helpful, make sure to give me a thumbs up and hit the subscribe button. Thank you, Opera, for sponsoring today's video and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Have you ever smelled the fragrance on someone and thought, wow, it's actually annoying how good they smell. We almost get a little jealous. You know, that's what we're going for here. That unforgettable impression. The right fragrance can not only boost your confidence, but also make you more attractive and more memorable. So let's get started on this honestly, really fun journey to finding your signature scent and to help us along the way. I'm partnering with Ajmal, a fragrance brand that has created amazing fragrances for over 70 years. And I'm going to be using these six fragrances as examples to make it easier for you to learn what to look for and what to avoid when looking for your ideal fragrance. So first things first, what exactly is a signature scent? People just throw that term around a lot, but most people don't even know what it means. It's that one fragrance that becomes synonymous with you. The one fragrance that people instantly associate with your presence, right? It's an extension of your personality. It's an extension of your style, of your overall vibe. Think of it like your favorite song or your go-to outfit. It's something that makes you feel good. Something that represents who you are at your core. Now that doesn't mean that it's your forever fragrance. It just means that it's your signature scent for this specific chapter of your life. It can and should change as you change and as your life changes. Also, something really amazing starts happening after you find your signature fragrances. You start to associate fragrance smells with chapters of your life. It's like a time machine. So for example, when I was a teenager, I used to wear Calvin Klein eternity. And the only reason why I have this fragrance here, you can see that it's new is because I wanted to have those memories bottled up right in here. Anytime I want to remember that chapter of my life, I smell this fragrance and it takes me years back to when I was in high school, back when I was learning how to drive, dating my first girlfriend, hanging out with my friends. And smells are really effective at triggering memories. Because the part of the brain that processes smells is actually directly connected to the part of the brain that's responsible for emotions, for memory storage, meaning sense, trigger really strong emotional associations with past experiences. It's one of my favorite things about fragrances, and honestly, it's what got me interested in collecting all of these bottles. But before you go crazy and buy all the same fragrances that you see on my collection or someone else's collection, stop. Because here's the thing about fragrances. They're not one size fits all. Every scent is unique. Every scent is complex. It's a blend of notes and characteristics that create a specific mood or a specific feeling. Some fragrances are fresh and invigorating, like a cold lemonade on a summer morning. Others are gonna be warm and spicy, like a cozy campfire on a winter night. Some are gonna be dark and mysterious, like a nighttime walk in the streets of New York City. Now, the first thing you need to consider is your environment. Where will you be wearing this fragrance? Because lifestyle and environment, they kind of dictate how you should smell. For example, you shouldn't wear heavy leather fragrance that's super powerful on a flight or to a college class because you're gonna drown people in that scent. It's way too much. If you're in that kind of setting or let's say a professional setting like going into your work office, you should look for these characteristics. Something that's subtle. Avoid anything that's too loud, too overpowering. A strong fragrance, that's gonna be distracting. It's gonna be off-putting in a professional setting. Look for fragrances with moderate, and longevity. Sillage, by the way, is a trail of scent that it leaves behind as you walk by. It should be sophisticated, a fragrance that shows maturity, that shows professionalism. Think classic scents instead of overly trendy or youthful scents. It should be fresh, clean, because those are generally better for work settings. And it should be versatile, so go for a fragrance that works well in different situations, from meetings to presentations to casual Fridays, and hopefully something that you can wear outside of work too. but please, no matter what, don't start your collection with the most popular scents out there, like Dior Sauvage or Bleu de Chanel, just because your friend has it or you've seen it online somewhere. Look, they smell great, but it's also kind of their downfall. Too many guys wear them, they're too popular. I know they're safe options, but trust me, take an extra few days to pick something that's unique. This right here is amazing. This is Ajmao's Velvet Noir, and it's perfect for that professional setting. It's unique, but it's not offensive, And it's perfect for daytime or nighttime because it has fresh bergamot and geranium combined with a warm woody, amber-y finish. So that's just a great mix and it smells so good. For active lifestyles or if you're just the kind of guy who likes to keep it casual, a fresh fragrance is the way to go. Something that keeps you feeling energized, refreshed throughout the day. Something that isn't heavy. Casual lifestyles are gonna pair really well with fresh, light scents. Two ajmal fragrances that I recommend for this lifestyle. One Long Island sunset. Floral, fruity, it has great energy, it's playful. Some of the notes are Italian lemon, watermelon, pink pepper, amber, and white musk. It's more of a daytime fragrance. It's for the guy who's out and about on the spring or summer day. But maybe instead of floral, you like powdery scents. Powdery scents smell very clean. Think of a fresh basket of laundry. Baby powder, body wash, that type of clean scent. And I like wearing that on a hot summer day when I just wanna smell fresh. You just don't want to wear a heavy scent when it's 80 degrees outside, you're sweating. Now you smell like wet leather, wet wood. You know, like if you live in a warmer climate, lighter and airier scents tend to work best. And musk sensual is elegant. It's got notes of white peach, white musk, Bulgarian rose, and it smells so clean. Immediately you think of refined, clean, fresh powder. Now, Amber Lumiere is a really good in between. For guys who want something refined, but not too heavy. For example, it has notes of mint and lavender, which are fresh, right? And then it also has notes of cedar wood, tobacco leaves, and amber, which are heavier, really masculine notes. This is a very well-balanced scent for guys who wanna smell masculine, but not too overpowering. Now, if you like to go out at night, if you're that kind of guy who wants to smell mysterious, attractive, masculine, then you want something bold. You don't want scents that have that powdery note. You don't want scents that have, you know, fresh, citrus notes. You want oud. Ud by the way is this dark wood that's used in incense in fragrances. You want amber, right? You want leather. Maybe that's the kind of guy you are. Maybe that's the kind of guy you wanna be, but Ud Allure is exactly that. It's an intense, woody, spicy fragrance. It shows strength, attraction. It has notes of cinnamon, saffron, incense, with Ud, vanilla, leather. It's exactly what you would want for a night out, for a date night. This is it. So think about all of these things, right? What kind of guy are you? What kind of guy are you trying to be to convey? And which one of these archetypes do you kind of fall into? Are you the fresh guy who wants to be more casual, who's more active? Are you in between who likes notes that are fresh, but also combined with Amber and Wood? Or are you the kind of guy who is mysterious, dark, who wants to be attractive at all times? Then you go for the heavier sense. Now I'd love to know which kind of guy you are and where you fall, so let me know in the comment section below. Now, something I really like to do too is match my fragrance to my style. So if you're wearing a leather jacket, for example, in boots, you probably don't wanna wear a light floral fragrance. Instead, you're gonna go for something that's more edgy, right, that's woody, that's got that leather scent, like Ajmao Crimson Santal. This is one of my favorite fragrances from the collection. I sprayed it to test it out last week and everyone here in the office really loved it immediately. On the other hand, if you're dressed up and you want something sophisticated, something elegant, right, Oudalore is gonna be great for that. compliments your attire perfectly. Sometimes I like to put on the outfit that I'm wearing. I look in the mirror, I grab the three fragrances that I'm choosing in between, and I just smell the fragrance while I'm looking at my outfit and I'm like, is this the vibe? Is this the right outfit? The right fragrance? Is this matching? Right? And then I'll smell, I'll just, I won't spray them, I just literally smell the nozzle, the atomizer, and try to see if it matches the vibe. You have to always make sure, for example, if you're wearing a casual outfit with an open shirt, right? So it's like clearly summertime, it's warm. You don't wanna wear heavy, ood, you know, amber fragrance. You want something like casual, floral, fresh, powdery. So keep that in mind because your style plays into how you find your signature fragrance, something that works really well for you, for your style and for your life, your environment. Now you might be thinking, okay, Alex, I get it, but where do I even start? I mean, I already have a couple of fragrances. I just don't wanna keep buying random fragrances and spending all of my money on these bottles. and you're absolutely right. Building a fragrance collection, it takes time. It takes experimentation. It's about finding what you love, what works for you, and what makes you feel best. Don't just buy a fragrance because it smells good on a friend or because you saw it in an ad. Take your time. Test different scents. See how they develop on your skin throughout the day. You can get samples, you can go to department stores and try them, or you can even blind buy your fragrances like I do. Usually I'll just blind buy my fragrances because I have so many of them and I just wanna keep collecting. So you know what, if I don't love it, probably gonna wear it once in a while anyway, just because it's fun. It's a really fun experience to just try new fragrances on and just, you know what, tonight I'm gonna smell like this, or tomorrow I'm gonna smell like that, and that's the fun in fragrances. It's a really great way to discover new scents and new experiences. Don't be afraid to branch out, to try something different. Find a fragrance that's unique to you, something that sets you apart from the crowd, because the last thing you want is to smell like everyone else. You want to be remembered for your distinct scent, not for smelling like your friend's ex-boyfriend or something like that. That would be the worst case scenario, right? Once you find a fragrance that you like, practice wearing it. See how it performs in different situations and how it makes you feel. Pay attention to the compliments that you're getting. Are people noticing your scent? Are you even getting any compliments? Are you attracting the right kind of attention? Is it guys or is it girls? What are you looking for? Also, here's the funny thing about fragrances. They're really great for making an impression other people, but you also kind of just start enjoying them for yourself, right? You throw on a fragrance, even at home, I wear a fragrance, no one's home. I'll throw it on just because it boosts my mood. It increases my level of energy. I don't know, it just makes me feel good. It's like when you take a shower and you get out of the shower and you smell really good. That's what it is. It makes you feel more put together, more elegant. And remember that finding your signature scent is all about this journey, this exploration, this self-discovery. Don't be afraid to experiment. different fragrances, get test sizes, talk to people, you know, spray one fragrance on this arm, spray fragrance on this other arm, ask people what they think, have fun with it. And I highly recommend you try these six fragrances here from Ajmal. I'm going to list them all below.

        "transcript": " Don't let your 20s slip away without learning the skills that will shape the rest of your life. Look, if you learn anything from this video, I want you to understand that it's never too late to learn a new skill or start a new hobby, but today is better than tomorrow. This is coming from a 36 year old who has done every job you can imagine. I worked at Domino's Pizza, Best Buy, I've been a landscaper, an EMT. I've worked in real estate. I worked at Google and now I own a media company and a men's grooming brand. And by doing that, I learned that in your twenties, that's just the best time to learn new skills because the sooner you learn them, the more time you have to use those skills in your twenties, thirties, forties and beyond. So make the most of this time by learning the skills that will make you more attractive, more confident, a more successful man. And in this video, I'm going to be sharing seven hobbies that will not only transform your present, but also set you up for a future with no regrets. And I wanted to start with, to me, one of the most powerful skills that a man could ever have. speaking and communication skills. The ability to communicate effectively is a superpower. Whether you're pitching an idea, negotiating a deal, or just having a conversation, being able to articulate your thoughts clearly, persuasively. I'm not even exaggerating. This is a life changing skill, especially in today's world of social media distractions, terrible texting habits, AI technology, doing all the thinking and writing for us. I mean, how often do you find yourself struggling to find the right words? Whether it's just asking someone on a date, you know, and you fumble it because you don't know what to say or presenting a project at work and you're just struggling to make your point or even just expressing your thoughts to a friend. You need to sharpen this incredible tool that we have as humans, communication. Learn to tell stories to articulate your ideas with precision. This is a skill that will benefit you in every area of your life from your career to your relationships to your overall sense of self-worth. Now I know what you might be thinking. I'm not a natural public speaker. I get nervous It's just thinking about it. That's okay. Everyone starts somewhere and this is where I recommend you start. I'm gonna give you three simple steps, right? This is a three-step formula that will help you improve you 10x your communication skills. The first thing you need to do is record a video five to 10 minutes of yourself talking about something that you really enjoy, something you're passionate about. Just use your phone. Make sure that you frame it so that you can see your hand gestures and all, kind of like this frame right here. Don't watch the video yet after you shoot it. Wait 24 hours. Then pull it up and watch it on mute. No sound. You're just gonna review the visuals. How is your posture? Do you look confident? Do you look sad or low energy? Make a bunch of notes. The second time you pull up the video, go ahead and play the sound, but don't watch it. Turn your phone upside down and just listen. Do you sound good? Are you easy to understand? Are you excited? Are you, do you sound frustrated? And the third time, you watch and listen at the same time. What else can you tell from seeing and hearing at the same time? Record and review. Sight, sound, then synced up. This is the best and the easiest way to improve your communication skills. The next skill has never been more valuable than right now because of the rise of social media. Knowing how to take a good photo is a skill that every man should have because if your girl asks you for a photo and this is what you give her, she's not gonna speak to you for a week, right? It's a fun hobby, it's creative, it can be challenging, but my favorite part about photography is that it's easy to integrate it into your daily life. Photos of your trips, photos of your family, or your friends, photos of your home. And it's more than just taking pretty pictures, it's about capturing moments, telling stories, and developing an eye for detail. It teaches you to see the world in a new way, to appreciate the beauty around you, to document your experiences. Plus, it's a really great conversation starter, and a way to connect with other people who share that passion. And since everyone has a camera in their pockets nowadays, right? It's something that every man should know. There's no need to get all this expensive equipment for a good photo like old days. In photography, you can also make you more attractive in subtle ways. It shows that you have an eye for detail, that you're creative. Nowadays, it's almost a necessity. It's actually so funny when I'm out and a girl that I don't know asks me, Hey, can you please take a photo of me and my friends? And when they see the photo, they smile from ear to ear because most men don't know how to do that. And since I've practiced so much on my Instagram, I enjoy doing it and I know how to take a good photo. They really like the outcome. So it's really nice to see them happy just because of something that I did in one second. Now to start, I would recommend watching some easy tutorials online, practice with your phone camera. You're going to get so many brownie points with women just for knowing how to take a good photo. So trust me on this one. Look, in general, when you improve yourself, you become more attractive, right? It's very easy to correlate those two things. And you can achieve that through skills like public speaking, knowing how to play an instrument, knowing how to be a good writer, or just by improving your confidence. Investing into personal skills through mentorship is always a good use of your time. Think about it this way. Every big athlete that you know has a coach. Every successful actor, even tech founders, have coaches that help them lead their companies. Working one-on-one with a certified coach is something that the majority of high performers do. And I'm no different. I learn so much from so many mentors through books, through podcasts. I organize masterminds to learn from other entrepreneurs. And I even have coaching sessions as well through our sponsor today, Strawberry.me. They make personal coaching accessible to everyone.

So I'm going to leave the link in the description below. This next skill is nowadays one of the most, if not the most important skill that you need to have for a great life. how to manage your finances, your investments, how to build wealth. This is a must when it comes to long-term success, long-term security, but Alex, I don't want to be rich. This isn't about being rich. This is about taking control of your future, creating a life of freedom and opportunity. Just think about the stress and the anxiety that comes from financial instability. Not knowing how to manage your money means that you're probably going to go into debt. You're going to miss opportunities because you can't afford to go on that trip with your family. You can't afford to go out to that nice restaurant. So no, it's not about getting rich. It's about being able to afford freedom, freedom to live an amazing life. And getting started with financial literacy definitely seems intimidating at first, but there's so many resources available to help. Start by reading books or articles on personal finance, listening to podcasts, taking online courses. I mean, there's also financial advisors who can provide personalized guidance for you. The key here is to start learning the basics. So it's not too intimidating, just the basics. And then gradually you're going to build your knowledge over time. It's an investment in yourself that would be a thousand percent worth it in the long run. And let's be honest, if there's one thing we know is that financial stability is very attractive. Women want a man who can feel secure, who isn't on the brink of bankruptcy, right? So start learning about finances as soon as possible. Let's get into the next attractive skill, which is knowing how to cook. That's a life skill that every man should have. It's not just about impressing dates, even though, you know, that's a pretty good bonus. It's about taking care of yourself, being self-sufficient and even saving some money in the process. So getting started with cooking doesn't have to be complicated by the way. You know, start with simple recipes and then gradually build your skills. There are thousands of online resources, cookbooks, cooking classes available to help you learn. I actually just took a cooking class with my girlfriend last month and I learned new cooking techniques and we got to spend some time together. We got to eat the meal after. It was actually pretty good and it was a great fun date. There were a lot of couples doing it as a date. So I highly, highly recommend it. Now something that I'm always really thankful for the fact that I speak two languages fluently. I was born in Brazil, so I speak Portuguese and then I moved to the US. So I speak English and Portuguese fluently. And my Spanish is pretty good too, but I wouldn't say I'm fluent like the other two. Learning a new language isn't just great because you get to communicate with more people, but also it broadens your perspective. It makes you a more interesting, more well rounded man. Think about the doors that open when you can speak another language. You can travel to new countries with confidence. You can connect with people from different backgrounds. You can experience the world in a whole new way. I mean, learning a new language is a mental workout that challenges your brain, that keeps it sharp. It also shows that you're curious, that you're open minded, that you're willing to step outside of your comfort zone. Cause let's be honest, it's not easy. It takes a long time, but nowadays you have so many things that help you out like apps, online courses, language exchange programs all over the world, you know, available to help you. And so that you learn at your own pace from the comfort of your own home. I mean, just find a language that interests you and then immerse yourself into it as as much as possible. And then you just watch movies in that language, listen to audio books or read books in that language, listen to music in that language. Fun story, I learned English listening to music at the time I was listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers and I would just read from the pamphlet that came with the CD back in the day. If you remember CDs, I would just read the lyrics. I was playing video games, The Sims, and I was watching movies in English. So that's how I learned English through those means. And nowadays you have, you know, duolingo and all these other things. So it's very, very easy to learn a new language nowadays compared to back in the day. Men think bilingual women are attractive. Women think the same thing about men. It shows that you're intelligent, shows that you're cultured and that you have a global perspective, right? You can also be valuable for your career. It opens up in your opportunities and it makes you a more desirable candidate when you're applying for a job. Another really attractive skill that every man should have is taking care of their physical Health and weightlifting is one of the most effective ways to do that. It's not even just about getting big muscles, right? It's about building strength, improving your physique, and then also just boosting your confidence. The dedication required to achieve your fitness goals also translate to so many other areas in your life. Now you have to wake up early. You have to be disciplined with your food, disciplined with how many times you're working out a week. Just think about the accomplishment, that feeling that you get that comes with pushing your physical limits, seeing your body transform. is really a journey of self improvement and it requires a lot of dedication. It requires consistency and it requires this willingness to push yourself outside of your comfort zone. It's a physical and mental challenge and it can build a lot of resilience, a lot of discipline. And of course, yeah, sure, big muscles. Why not? Because let's be honest, a strong physique is undeniably attractive, right? It shows that you're dedicated to your health, your discipline, you're capable of achieving your goals. You also boost your confidence when you're going out there and getting into dates, right? It makes you feel more comfortable in your own skin. But something else that I've really been into lately is music, right? And music is a universal language that connects people all over the world. Learning to play an instrument is a creative outlet. It's a form of self-expression, and it's a great way to impress other people. It takes dedication, it takes practice, but the rewards are great, right? Plus, it can open doors to new social circles, new experiences. I've been playing the guitar for a little while now, and I absolutely love it. I mean, it's fun, it's challenging, It's creative. My girlfriend loves it when I play at home. It's just a great skill to have. It's a rewarding experience that can bring you years of enjoyment. I mean, it challenges your brain. It improves your coordination. And it can even be therapeutic. And it's a skill that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. So if you think about it, I mean, my plan is to be playing the guitar when I'm 70 or 80 years old. That sounds fun. And guys, getting started with music is now easier than it's ever been. I mean, there are so many tutorials, music teachers available to help you on Zoom, right? You can find local groups or bands to join and just have fun with your friends. I mean, it's all about practicing consistently, maybe do 30 minutes a day or an hour every few days. The key is to have fun with it, to enjoy and to just explore and challenge yourself. Look, these seven hobbies are just a starting point. Yeah, of course, you're going to be more attractive, but that's not it. You're also going to feel much, much better about your life. You're going to be a lot more fulfilled and with confidence. So make sure that you start them now and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " If you're looking for outfit inspo, you clicked on the right video. I'm going to show you five outfits I put together for different occasions, like going to a coffee shop, business casual outfits, and even a comfortable and classy travel outfit for your next flight featuring my favorite backpack from TravelPro. Let's put the first outfit together, an outfit that you can wear to a coffee shop and look great while getting work done. We're going to start with this white wool long sleeve polo from Reese. I like the zipper detail. It elevates the look. Brown pants are from Club Monaco. And to be honest, they're probably four, five years old at this point. But they still look great. The brown leather loafers are from Loro Piana. I splurged a few months ago and I wear these all the time now. To add some warmth and texture, I'll wear this beautiful navy jacket from Reese. I really like the pocket details and the texture pattern. On the wrist, I'm wearing the Patek Philippe Aquanaut in gold with a chocolate brown dial and strap. And since I'd wear this to a coffee shop here in New York City, the TravelPro Altitude Slim Expandable Backpack is the way to go. It has multiple compartments. It keeps your laptop or tablet safe. The Zippered expansion gives you up to 20% more space. The full grain leather details are stylish. I'll make sure to link it in a description for you guys. Moving on to the next outfit, I wanted to style something so easy that anyone could pull off. So of course I had to go with all black. The pants are from Suitsupply. They're in a straight fit, so not too tight or loose. The tank is from ATOS. It's thicker than the usual ribbed tank. And let me give you the secret right now to making an all black outfit look great. You need to add texture. So this cardigan from Suit Supply is doing just that. It's making what would be a boring outfit look way more put together. It adds some personality to the outfit. The loafers are also from Suit Supply. I mean, you really can't go wrong with black leather loafers. The watch is a Submariner. I think the black dial looks great with the black outfit. I wore this outfit actually to a night out here in New York City last weekend. I really liked it. So I wanted to show you how to put it together so you can wear something similar next time you need an easy nighttime outfit. This is it. Next up, let's have some fun with earth tones. We're gonna start with this cable knit sweater from Outer Known. This is a classic sweater. Every guy should have a cable knit sweater in his closet. The tan pants are from Reese. I really like the way they fit. The sneakers are from a collab between ALD and New Balance and they have this cool felt finish to add texture to this outfit. Because it's sunny in New York City, I decided to throw on a pair of shades from Salt Optics in the same color scheme. Even though it's sunny, it's also very cold here. So I'm gonna wear this overcoat from Banana Republic. This is an outfit that I would wear to commute, to see friends, to work, run errands. And so the TravelPro Altitude Expendable Backpack is great for that. It's a little bigger than the last one. So it has tons of organized storage, the same premium leather details. This is a great backpack for you guys that like to have some more space. Maybe you're bringing more equipment to work or books. You can just open that zippered expansion to get more space any time you need it. And besides that, of course, this looks great. It's a very professional looking backpack. It's very classy. Next, this outfit is for my guys who like to wear jeans. I figured I'd have at least one outfit with jeans here for you. These jeans are actually from Madewell. They have a straight loose fit. They've been tailored to be a little bit more tapered just so you know. This sweater is from Suit Supply. It's cashmere, so it's extremely comfortable and warm. The boots are from Converse, believe it or not, and they have a fleece inner lining to keep my feet warm. Then we're gonna throw on an overcoat from Hevo. This is a brand that I found recently and I really, really like it. My favorite part about this overcoat besides the perfect fit, as you can see, is the fact that it has not just the flap pockets, but also these hidden pockets right above it. I have a pet peeve. I don't like overcoats that just have those flap pockets because sometimes I want to warm up my hands and these are perfect pockets right here. I'd wear this outfit on a day out with my girlfriend or at lunch with friends. This is such an easy one to copy. And again, any guy can pull this off so you can easily wear this yourself. Okay, so you know how the majority of guys tend to dress horribly for flights, right? I have a solution for you because sweats and sweatshirts and hoodies, that's just not the way to go. Sometimes you just want to look a little bit better. This is a travel outfit I will always recommend because it's comfortable, stylish, and easy to put together. The textured sweater is from Madewell. I'm wearing a tee underneath, so if I get hot on the plane, I can just take the sweater off. The pants are literally called the Traveler Pants from Reese, which is a perfect name for them in this outfit. The white sneakers are from Arnie. they're easy to put on or to remove. I personally like to take my shoes off on flights longer than three hours. So this is perfect. The overcoat is from KOS. This is a thin lightweight overcoat. So when I get into the plane, I can just roll it up and I can just put it away. I can use it as a blanket. I can use it as a pillow. And what brings us all together for the perfect travel outfit is the TravelPro Altitude Large Expandable Backpack. This is the holy grail of backpacks. I've been loving this backpack. I like to bring a ton of stuff with me when I travel and this will easily fit anything and everything. I'm not exaggerating. This is the best backpack that I've ever owned. It's comfortable, it looks great, it has so much organized storage, it has a hidden pocket for a tracker. You can even get a tech organizer bag that hooks onto the inside of the backpack so it doesn't get in the way. I mean, I could go on and on, but the point here, I have backpacks that cost thousands and thousands of dollars from designers and I keep going back to this one. And that's because this backpack is amazing. These are the five outfits any guy can copy and pull off. I'm gonna link everything that I mentioned in the description below. Thank you TravelPro for sponsoring this video. I will also leave a link to their backpacks in the description below, and I'll see you guys in the next video."

        "transcript": " Let's be real. School doesn't teach you everything you need to know about life. School gives you the basics, but life is unpredictable. And eventually things will go wrong. There are really important life lessons that you will only learn through experience. And in this video, I'm going to be sharing 12 life lessons that I wished I learned when I was younger. Things that would have saved me time, would have saved me a lot of money and headaches. And if you're under 30 or even a little bit older, this video is for you. By now you should know that time is your most valuable resource. Once it's gone, you can never get it back. How to manage your time well is like having a superpower because it allows you to actually get done all those things on your to-do list all the Goals you write down if you don't have good time management skills those tasks and those goals don't mean anything So lesson one is to become great at managing your time. I used to be terrible at this I would procrastinate I'd get distracted in waste hours on things that weren't important Somehow I landed a full-time job at Google and started working next to some very smart efficient people and that's when I learned how to manage my time. By copying what they were doing, I started using the right tools like calendars, to-do lists, time blocking, and it completely changed my productivity. I was able to get more things done in less time and I felt much less stressed because I was actually getting shit done instead of stressing about getting them done. And by the way this isn't about cramming as much as possible into your day, it's about prioritizing your tasks, setting realistic deadlines, getting rid of distractions. Lesson two, I used to be really insecure about my looks, all right? I didn't know how to dress. My hair was a mess. I just generally didn't feel good about myself But then I started learning about style about grooming fitness and it completely changed my life I started feeling more confident people treated me differently and I even started getting more opportunities It all started with taking care of my image school doesn't teach you about the importance of your image But it matters a lot. So lesson two is respect the power of self-image It might sound vain But how you present yourself to the world affects how people see you how they treat you and even how you feel about yourself It's not vanity. It's respect. When you take care of your appearance, when you dress well, when you groom yourself before you meet with someone, it shows people that you respect them and that you respect yourself. And on top of that, you get a big confidence boost and that confidence can change everything. Think about it this way. Your image, it's like your personal brand, right? It's the first impression that you make on people. You want to be seen as someone who's capable, trustworthy, successful. When you invest into your image, you're investing into yourself. You're showing the world that you value yourself and that you pay attention to the details. Lesson number three, and I'll never understand how schools don't teach you this one. It's unreal. How are you going to attend years and years of school and graduate without learning everything about finances? Income and expenses, gross versus net profits, taxes, the stock market savings, managing debt, managing your retirement fund. I mean, it makes me so mad and frustrated that after all those years in school, I had to read a ton of books, do months of research to understand that stuff. And this is something that we all need to know. It's not a good to know. It's need to know. Why aren't schools teaching you the ins and outs of retirement funds? They teach us some shit that we'll never need like how to find X in this equation, but not how to do our taxes, which every single person has to do by law. Financial literacy empowers you to make smart decisions with your money, to build wealth, to build a better life. And let me just get this out of the way. I'm not against school. I'm not against going to college. I went to college for criminal justice. I wanted to be a lawyer. I studied hard. My problem with the school system is that it's so outdated. You know, it needs a complete refresh for the modern day, and it needs to be refreshed every year with new topics like social media, crypto, AI, for it to be worth our time, the student's time. Otherwise, you're just sitting there for hours every day learning things that are useless in your life. So the point here is that you have to learn on your own if you wanna be successful in life. Look, I grew up in a low income household. We moved to the US when I was a teenager. My parents didn't teach me anything about finances because they didn't know how these things worked in the US. So on my own, I started learning about budgeting, investing, US taxes, and it completely changed my relationship with money. I felt more in control, more secure, and more confident about my future. Financial literacy isn't just about making more money, it's about understanding how to make smart financial decisions that will benefit you in the long run. Lesson number four, school isn't gonna help you much with self-awareness. And it's a shame because knowing yourself, it allows you to learn from your mistakes. I'll give you an example. I've hired dozens of employees and contractors in my life and in every single interview, I ask them the same question. And I'm gonna ask you the question. I want you to take a second to answer it truthfully as if I was interviewing you for an amazing job. What are your biggest strengths and what are your biggest weaknesses? Knowing what you're really good at will help guide you in the right direction. So if you're great with people, you should be in a role that lets you interact with people like sales, customer service, HR. And if one of your weaknesses are, let's say, organization, you probably shouldn't be unaccounted because your documents need to be perfectly tidy and organized, right? So lesson four is knowing the importance of self-reflection, self-awareness. I like to take time to reflect on my life, my career, my relationships. It helps me stay grounded, make better decisions, and it guides me onto the right path. So who are you? What are your values? A good way to find out is to talk to a professional. Someone who understands people, it can help you organize your head, your thoughts, the same way that you would organize your computer hard drive or your desktop folder. Our sponsor BetterHelp can connect you to a professional so that you can organize your mind and help you answer any questions about yourself. They offer therapists specialized in any area that you might need help with. You should look at therapy like a coaching session. You're learning about yourself, why you act a certain way, why you get mad in certain situations, why you're socially shy, you're anxious, why you have a hard time asking for help or making friends or communicating with your girlfriend. That's why therapy is so good for you. It gives you a safe space to talk about those things that let's be honest, men don't really share. It's not something that we tend to talk about, not even with our closest friends sometimes. So you sign up online, they match you with a therapist according to your needs, and then you can schedule your sessions as a phone call, video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so that you don't have to go in person. It's discreet, it's on your schedule. This is the most practical way of talking to a professional and getting real advice about what's going on in your life. I get to talk to my therapist about topics that I don't talk to anyone else about. Your therapist is another person on your side, your team. And again, you can always stop if you don't like it, or you can swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which BetterHelp offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for any reason whatsoever. So click that first link in the description, it's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta, and you even get a discount on your first month. Lesson number five, okay, schools might teach you about hard work and theory, but they don't really prepare you for the real world, right? When I first started my YouTube channel, I was working three jobs. I was going to school and I was still somehow finding time to create content. It was exhausting, but I was determined to make it work. I would wake up early, stay up late, grind every single day, and eventually it paid off. My channel started growing, I was able to quit my jobs, and now I get to do what I love for a living. It all came down to hard work and dedication, and that's lesson number five. You have to know the value of hard work and discipline. Hard work isn't just about putting in the hours, right? About grinding and hustling. It's about working smart. It's about setting goals, prioritizing your tasks, finding efficient ways to get things done. It's also about being persistent and not giving up, even when things get tough. And trust me, things are going to get tough. Lesson number six, you've probably all heard the saying, your network is your net worth. Having strong relationships with people in your field, your mentors and other professionals, That's gonna open doors for new opportunities and accelerate your career growth. When I moved to the US and I didn't speak English, I became really shy and introverted. And I struggled with networking, which at the time was just really making friends, because I was embarrassed of my accent. I felt dumb. And it wasn't until much later that I realized how important it is to connect with other people to learn from those who are more experienced. Networking has helped me land jobs, grow my businesses, become a better person, because I was learning from those people in my network who already went through the same things I did. So school doesn't teach you this stuff. It's crazy to me. The best way to build a strong network is by providing value first. This is something that you learn online, but not in school. So let's say someone tells you in passing that they don't like their gym. You tell them, hey, I go to a great gym and I have a free pass. You should come check it out with me next time. You know, I'm going next week. It's as easy as that, right? You're offering value. All of a sudden, this person sees you as a valuable asset, valuable part of their network. So provide as much value as you can, connect people, remember their names, treat them well, be a good friend. One great connection can change your life. Also, it feels nice to provide value. It's a good feeling. Lesson number seven, your physical health is one of the most important, most valuable assets in your life. You have gym classes in school, you have health classes sometimes, and it usually sucks, let's be honest. And we all know that taking care of your body leads to a happy, fulfilling, successful life. So why not just go deeper into the subject? I don't understand why schools don't do that. Every student should be getting a fitness tracker, like a whoop or something, right? Should be learning how to cook healthy meals, how to count your calories. Every student should have access to the same thing, right? These are basic things. I used to neglect my physical health. I would work long hours, skip meals, not prioritize exercise or sleep, but then I realized how much it was affecting my overall well-being and my ability to perform in my best. So now I make sure to prioritize my health and it's made a huge difference in my life, huge. Lesson number eight is learning to say no to commitments, to invites, to opportunities that don't align with your goals or your values. And learning to protect your time, really, protect your time and protect your energy. Learning to set boundaries. In your 20s, you know, you feel like you're kind of pressured to say yes to everything, parties, work, projects, favors for friends, but it's important to remember that you have a limited amount of time and energy. So saying yes to everything needs to burn out. And the feeling of being overwhelmed, feeling like it's too much and you just wanna hide from the world, but you already said yes to that party, so now you kinda have to show up. Learning to say no politely, but firmly is a skill that takes practice, but it's really important for your long-term success. It lets you focus on what's important to you, and it lets you skip the things that don't add any value to your life. Lesson number nine, school teachers are in a way our first mentors, right? They're supposed to teach us about life, or at least about specific topics that they're teaching, but school doesn't teach you how to find mentors after you graduate. They make it seem like schools, all you need. And this video is proof that that's not true. You have to learn so much more outside of school. So, so finding mentors and learning from those were more experienced than you, that's going to speed up your personal and your professional development. And in your twenties, you're still figuring things out. So you, you know, having a mentor is going to help you avoid those common mistakes, make smarter decisions. And you know, finding a mentor can be as simple as reaching out to someone that you admire on Instagram or Twitter or email asking for their advice. It could be a professor, it could be a former boss, someone you know or someone you don't know and want to connect with online. The key is to be proactive and to look for guidance from mentors who have already achieved what you're looking to do. Lesson number 10 is huge. It's what drives me personally. What keeps me going. Discovering your passions, values, what truly motivates you will give you direction, will give you a life meaning. So finding your purpose is so, so important. What makes you tick? What gets you excited? How do you want the world to remember you when you're gone? Your 20s are a time of exploration, self-discovery. It's a time to try a new thing, experiment with different career paths, figure out what truly matters, what truly makes you tick. Don't be afraid to take risks. Step outside of your comfort zone. Try different things, different passions. Finding your purpose isn't always just linear, right? It can involve twists, turns, setbacks, challenges. But the journey is really valuable and it can lead you to a life that's both meaningful and fulfilling. I did every kind of odd job you can imagine before I landed where I am today. So I am proof that you just have to try things out until you find something that you love and something that works for you. Lesson number 11, the people that you surround yourself with have a huge impact on your life. I'm talking about your friends, your mentors, your romantic partners. You have to choose them wisely, right? Otherwise you're not creating a positive supportive environment that empowers you to grow and I learned this lesson the hard way In my 20s I surrounded myself with people who weren't always the best influence somewhere negative somewhere Unmotivated some were just toxic and it wasn't until I started being more intentional about the people that I spent time with that I realized how much they were holding me back now I'm incredibly grateful for the amazing people with my life. My friends are supportive inspiring. They challenge me to be better. My mentors, they offer really great guidance and wisdom. And my partner is my biggest cheerleader. So choosing your people wisely isn't about being judgmental or exclusive, right? It's about recognizing the impact that other people have on your life. It's about surrounding yourself with the people who lift you up, who inspire you, who support your growth, and who you get inspired by. These are just some of the things to consider when choosing your people. Do they share the same values and beliefs? Do they inspire you to be better? or they bring you down? Do they support your goals and your dreams? Do they treat you with respect? Are they trustworthy? Can you communicate openly and honestly with them? Because building a strong support system is one of the most valuable investments that you can make in your life, and especially in your 20s. The older you get, typically the harder it's going to be to make new friends. Lesson 12, knowing how to communicate well is essential for building strong relationships, for resolving conflicts, for achieving your goals. Honestly, Knowing how to tell a good story, how to get people to truly listen to you is such an incredible and underrated skill. You know, for connecting with people, being a good storyteller is everything. You get to inspire other people, you get to make them really connect with you, plus learning how to tell great stories, it just makes you a more interesting person overall. So be a good storyteller, learn how to communicate. Reminder that I just launched a new YouTube channel for my vlogs, so you get to see how I'm building my businesses, my day-to-day in New York City, and much, much more. I'm going to link it below. I'll see you there and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Matt, hold on, Matt. We're 20 today. Yeah, I know. Great. Nice sweatshirt. Matt's the owner, founder of the Lift Method. It's a personal training location. I have two locations actually in New York City. sessions I mean you could probably explain it better than I can but the place is absolutely beautiful and we're gonna be doing a session here right now. Alright let's get it. What is it? What is it? What's the deal? We're a private training studio specialized in one-on-one training. We've got a recovery space here on the upper east side called Rituals. It's got infrared sauna, cold plunge, and steam room. Come check us out. It's like he's being super humble about it but it's like the nicest gym I've ever seen in New York City. We did it at my place before, we actually got a private shift to come and cook for us. It was really nice. Just friends and then we went to fly fish, dressed for the countdown, had some drinks and then came back to my place for a little after party. So it was like, it was nice, it was like intimate. It was cool. Yeah, it was good. Start with some split squats, some chin-coating chips. That's it. Come on up. Are they good? I don't know. I'm gonna have some. Left arm extends. We'll say three reps per side. We'll do split squats. Let's do two warm-up sets. And we'll find something that's pretty challenging but not like killing every set but by the sixth set you should be like I want to be done Go! Go! Half length. Good. He's trying to kill me. Save me guys. Save me. This is a good reminder that like, I don't see guys having a good trainer, even if like you go a lot. Yeah. I work out every day. But I do my own program, I'll do a class here and there. When you work with a trainer, and you do completely different things, it just hits so different. Let's say the battery died, we gotta go change it in like five minutes. Little pause and then down twice. You want me to get up? Yes. Thank you. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. You know we're filming something great right now. This is gonna be unbelievable. I think he saw the camera and was like, I'm gonna f**k him up today. He's like I need to show people what happens after I go. I'm gonna show him what the lip-eth is all about. Tight grip. Let's go about like knee grips. Excellent grip. Alright, that was fun. Thanks for coming. How many trainers do you have here? God, 75 trainers. I have two locations. You know, God really put a location on the way. Self-fungus, self-stargant. Yeah, you know the story. Yeah, yeah. The gym, the gym. That's amazing. Still good to hear. Success stories like that, you know. Well deserved. So, good guy. It's been a 20 year overnight success, if you know what I mean. I know exactly what you mean. Exactly what you mean. It's a real deal right here guys. The live method, it's legit. Check it out. I'm doing something I've never done before. And I've had a UC channel for 15 years now. And it's been this channel. If you go back 15 years, you're going to see videos on this channel. Playing video games with me, speaking Portuguese, everything, everything my whole entire career is on this channel. But today, I'm starting a new YouTube channel. And I've thought about this a lot. And I wanted to give you guys where on this main channel, everything that you've signed up for. Self image improvement, and where it comes to hair, grooming, fashion, anything that helps you elevate your image. On this new channel, this is gonna be a vlog only channel. So I know a lot of you guys have been asking for it, and here it is. So by separating it, when you come to the vlog channel, you're gonna see exactly what you're seeing here. You know exactly where you're gonna get 20 to 30 minute long vlogs, you get to see my life, but most importantly, you get to see how I'm building my businesses. That's really what I wanna focus on with the new vlog channel. Now the cool thing about this new vlog channel is that it's already up and there's already a vlog there right now that happened basically after this one. So we were quick with it, we have a new vlog for you to watch right this second if you go there and subscribe to the channel and make sure that you turn on the notifications because we're gonna be uploading vlogs there consistently moving forward. So what's the plan today? We actually have a few guys coming over and I've been wanting to do this for a long time. So I've been wanting to organize an entrepreneurial meetup, just a bunch of guys who are doing cool projects, get together and do a round table. Each person presents their projects and then we have 15 minutes of just brainstorming and just helping this person out. It creates a space where we can learn, We can give value, we can get value. I think I curated, I think, a pretty good group. So you haven't met some of them, but good guys, good guys. I don't know what the best format will be, but we'll start with this, and then ideally we can make it bigger in the future, get more people involved, get better structure. I mean, you guys are all my friends, so we'll just keep it super casual. And I was thinking like 15 minutes, just present your project, remind me before today, surprise, and then 15 minutes, I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on the brand and what could be better. And I mean the whole goal is like honest feedback, just throw ideas against the wall and we'll see what sticks and we'll go from there. And then another thing that we're going to do as well, which is actually what we're doing now, is founder-led content, you know, because that's something that's been popping up a lot. Nowadays, founders being the face of the company, posting about building the company and bringing the audience along for the journey. Challenges, wins, losses, just being honest, you know. I never talked about like, this is what I'm doing to grow the brand. This is what I do on a day to day as a founder. And I think people can relate to that, even if they're doing projects that are completely different from e-commerce or grooming or whatever, or even content creation. They can relate to a challenge. They can relate to someone who's hustling to achieve something, right? So, you know, and I want to be just be more open with the audience. You have a vlog, it's about the culture of the thing. So it's an overarching story. That's why you said like the struggles matter. The struggles matter for people that are tuning in to you as a story line. I think Waterboy does a slightly elevated, more intermediate. I think they're they're crushing it, but it's still childish. They're catering to college students. since more of a hangover product. And I think someone that is winning right now when it comes to the branding is ProMix. ProMix to me reads like a supplement which is better than a soft drink. The other ones look like gummies. We're trying to find the happy medium of we just look so scientific and supplement like but also this could sit on the shelf of a target and somebody knows oh this is an electrolyte during mix. And help them with a couple things. The main thing is curating their image online, right? Because if you're a software engineer and you're 29 and you grinded the last couple years to make good money, establish yourself, it's like, okay, still get no b****, right? So it's like, you go on the dating apps, your photos are like cringe vacation photos and you don't really know how to present because you're just not that type of person. So we help them, we connect them with a photographer, we do like a wardrobe overhaul, the whole Shabang, build their profiles for them, etc. So they can start getting matches, start going on dates, show them how to be less logical in conversation, be more emotional and just have a little bit more charisma in the way they speak and act. Some Riz. Riz, yeah, exactly. We're going to be the YouTube exchange. And what that means is you are going to be able to take a video where you make a certain amount of money every month from Google. You're going to be able to list it on our exchange and in lieu of waiting two, three, four, five years to make those royalties from all those ads, you're going to be able to sell them to the general public in fractals, which is the same as shares we just call them fractals. The moment they buy those shares into that video or that catalog or that channel depending on how you list it, then they will in lieu make the royalties from those ads and you You will make all that money up front, if that makes any sense. It's better on a computer. Nice. Yeah. With the weather. Enjoy the snacks. It's becoming more and more. I wish Emily was here. And if you just have a dynamic. Oh yeah. A whole buffet. Oh, and you get fun. Yeah. You have all the extras there. Me, I'm like, you guys get some peanuts. I'm just going to figure it out. There's some carrots. It's an adventure. Snacks are the real recently come to that house. I'm just laughing. By the time you guys are seeing this vlog, my new product, Forte Series Chrome Clay, will be out and available for you guys. So this is a product that's really special to me because Roger and I were actually just talking about this. I literally dreamed, I had this dream one night of like a bathroom filled with chrome products and it looked so sick and I woke up the next day and I was like, I gotta make a chrome product. And the first thing that came to mind was chrome clay. We were redeveloping our old clay which was called control clay. We wanted to make it better. So it was just the perfect time to create a new product. So what is Chrome Clay? Basically, yeah, it looks cool, but there's way more to it than that, right? Our texture clay is more of an advanced product, I would say. It's pretty difficult to scoop. It's kind of hard for you to emulsify it. So it's for more advanced users. Chrome Clay is for the everyday guy. This is like so easy to use. The results are great. And it smells amazing. Our signature scent from Forte. And it's just to me, the perfect everyday product that you can use for pretty much any hairstyle. So this is out now. It's my baby. I've been working on this for a long time. Like I said, I had a dream and it came true and I'm excited and it's available right now. So I'm gonna link it below. You ready to go to the Bahamas? I wish, bro. Oh my God. We're leaving Colony or to go to Colvin, Kuber. Not even snowboarding or skiing or anything. Bahamas would be way better. Way better. But you know, we're gonna get a lot of work done and we only do this once or twice a year, so. It's about time. So we're off to Vancouver today. Vancouver, Canada, if you're not familiar. A lot of people don't know this, but the whole team for 4J Series sits in Vancouver, unless of course they work remotely. Every year we do an offsite around January, just because it's the beginning of the year and we like to start fresh, see everybody, have a good time, get some good food, talk about our goals for the year, talk about what went right last year, what went wrong and start the year feeling connected, feeling good as a team right so we can tackle this year properly head on and and have a good year. Every time I get to see the team because we're so far I feel really good, I feel blessed, I feel excited and I think it's good to just just for the morale of the team too so we do it once a year right now but it it would be great to just do it more often. It's always like really fun packing my grooming stuff just because slowly it's becoming more and more forte stuff which is a good thing. We're doing good work. We're coming out with a lot of new products. I'm actually bringing Protagonist, our newest fragrance that we just launched and I'm bringing it in our to-go atomizer so you can just fill it up like this. It's full, right? You can spray and literally just bring it in here. So there's enough here for a whole trip and it looks really nice. I even bring it out with me sometimes if I'm going out, if I'm staying out for a long time. I'll just literally put it in my pocket because it's so small, so sleek. I'm bringing good old texture clay extreme hold. It just doesn't get any better than this one. It's the first product we ever launched and to me, it's just the best. Bringing that, feeling pretty good. Leaving New York City is cool. Like you know you have the bridge and you see the water, it's cool. But driving into New York City, man. I don't know, for me it's just always like I just take a deep breath. I was looking at the city and I'm like, why do I live here? Like how did I get here? This is insane. It just feels, it doesn't even feel real sometimes. Like when I lived in LA, it probably took me three, four years to be like, all right, I get it, I live in LA. I've only been in New York for two and a half, so it's probably gonna take me a little while, maybe even longer to feel like I live in New York. That's like my city, you know? It doesn't feel that way still. What's up? Ready for this flight? Yep. It's gonna be a long one. Yes sir. It's a big size. We're about to leave. Yeah. Let's find some coffee. There's a Starbucks right there, but I really, really don't want to go to Starbucks. Tim Hortons! Let's do it! Let's go! Let's do it! I mean, we're here, we might as well. Bringing back memories. Right? That's our, what? What would you compare Tim Hortons to in America? Kind of like Dunkin' Donuts. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, literally ducket donuts. We're gonna order some bits. We'll do some like six of the birthday cake. We'll do six of the chocolate glaze and six of the honey. So I was gonna do a backup to integrate your cake. Let's do 20 total. Yeah, we'll just split it in half. Okay, so the birthday in this one. We'll do six of the chocolate and the rest of the honey glaze. Yeah, so I want to start off by thanking everyone for the hard work last year. We went from 3.7 million in top line to 5.1, which is awesome. And in addition to that, we were able to double our bottom line, which is, I think, even more important. And yeah, thanks to everyone for the dedicated work. Whenever we break through to the next stage of business, what we do next sort of, Whatever we prioritize next changes and ask the question, what does it take for us to be the leader in the personal, or men's personal care market? And that allows us to then identify the long-term vision and allow us to keep our eyes open and keep our eyes focused on that long-term vision and work from where we are to that point. So the conclusion that I have at this point, that we have at this point, is to actually become the the number one most recommended brand in the barbering community. So barbers, when they're asked what products to use, they recommend Forte series. 10-year target, asking the question, what does it take for us to be the leader in the men's personal care market? And it's to become the number one recommended the number one choice for barbers for personal care products recommendation all over the world. And we also need to make it very effortless for guys to purchase. So retail distribution and e-commerce distribution. In the future we want to add barbers and we're talking about shops, barber shops, and the actual individual barbers. And the way that we want to do that is by getting them great a great affiliate structure, helping them grow their social media business, which then brings them more revenue online. Let's say they want to sell a barber course or whatever, or it's also going to help them sell more physically in person because the bigger your brand is online. Of course the more customers you're going to be seeing going into the barber shop because they've seen their content online and like their cuts, like their personality, like their barber shop, etc. We need to give Forte a heartbeat. People need to see that we are real people. We go through real challenges. We are not a crazy big brand with a big team. You know, we're very much in the beginning stages of all of this. And we have a lot, you know, a mountain to climb. And that's why I brought up the word community. Because when we have a community of people that are actually rooting for us and loyal to us and they see that we are real people and we have a heartbeat. They just become loyal customers. They follow the journey. I don't miss. The pressure's on. Okay. The pressure is on. You know what? I heard you don't miss it. I'm gonna... Well, it went in. That's messed up. You saw that. That's messed up. That was perfect. That was clinical. That was too narrow. That was too narrow. All right, I'm going to stop right here. See Brian's lost four words. Okay, all right. You want to try? You want to try? See what you got then. Let's see what you got then. Wait, do I just put it anywhere here or is there fine? Oh, oh. Right here? Where are you going? Right there. Okay. See you later. See you later. All right. That's way worse. That's way worse. Let's put it away. Oh yeah. Day one finished. Yeah. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. Have a little surprise for the vlog. It's the surprise. Well, you see when we get there. We're going to go somewhere, pick something up, something fun. What are we getting? So you'll be driving the brand new 2025 Bentley Continental GT Speed. The new 2025 comes with a brand new powertrain. It's the 4-liter VA twin turbo plug-in hybrid. With the new plug-in hybrid, you get the option to drive in EV mode or hybrid mode or sport mode. Basically, utilize both the engine output and the electric motor together to give the maximum performance. You will definitely experience the difference when it comes to the drive and also the suspension has been revised as well. I just got these a few days ago. Yeah. Every time I come to Vancouver, and I come here once or twice a year, mostly for foretaste stuff, these guys at Aster Martin Vancouver take such good care of me. So I just want to plug them, shout them out for giving me this beautiful Bentley Continental GT for the duration of my trip. This is a 2025 brand new, they just literally got it a few days ago and they're trusting me with it. I mean, just look at the interior of this car. beautiful. So thank you Esmeralda Vancouver for hooking me up. Let's go for a drive. I guess we can just go towards the restaurant now and... Just drive around. See if you can pick up any baddies. Not you Alex, just me. I'm glad you said that. that. Before I get you in trouble. Yeah, I have nothing to do with this plan. Yeah. Nice. So cheers to a great 2024, going into 2025. I hope that this year we get to do this more often. That we get to actually get more in person, that we get to continue to do this team bonding activities. I hope you guys get to come to New York. I know Matt, Matt likes New York. Brian is indifferent, but would still like to host you in New York anytime, of course. Me and Roger we go. You can say with Roger we go. And here's to building forte. Here's to making it special. Let's go. Cheers. One of the first things they're gonna do is either they're gonna Google us, and sometimes the Instagram pops up right away, or they're going to go on Instagram and click on us. Or if an influencer is posting us, or if I'm posting us and tagging us, they're going to click on the tag and go to Forte. What's the first impression that they're going to have? That's going to be so, so important, right? But the whole point of this is, this is our billboard. This might be, and a lot of times it is, the first time that people see Forte series in their lives. And we want it to be exciting to them, right? So it's really important that we make the Instagram look good. I really like the new year, new you image. The, all the images actually that Rodrigo shot and that cat edited, they came out really good. I think it speaks to who we are. It's high quality, black and white, looks good. And obviously the agency content is super, super clean. Bro, fluffy hairstyle, slick back. And then like the wavy, like Timothy Shalame, that's whatever is going to be trending, which it probably will, So yeah, there's a movie coming up and then Slick Back and the fluffy hair. Yeah, it sounds like a classic coming back. Yeah, and then you click on that image and it'll go to a collection page with the products or even just the routine with all the products you need for that hairstyle. Because for the Slick Back it's gonna be pomade and then maybe like Arvino and then the wavy hairstyle, sea salt, spraying cream and then the fluffiest texture powder and whatever, but like have a seasonal section where I swapped out cause I mean, I'll know, I should know what is coming up or what is popular that season. Maybe we can kind of combine those two ideas of the tutorials and the popular hairstyle, let's say. And we have that revolving door of popular hairstyles and then it also brings them to a tutorial for each of those hairstyles. It's really good for SEO too, to say. Like last year, it would have been old money hairstyle routine. And then you could even get out of like, out of meditation. Yeah. Yeah. So he teaches him how to achieve. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So he teaches him how to achieve. Yeah. Yeah. You got some people taking photos of the Bentley, you know? You like it? Yeah, very good. It's good. You're gonna buy it? Yeah, right now. Yeah. 2025. Beautiful. All right. Glad you like it. Glad to see it. Yeah. Yeah. All right, I'm about to show you guys something that I haven't showed anyone yet. It's our new product that's launching from today in a couple of weeks. When you see this, it might be launched already or it might be launching very, very soon. It's a product that we've been working on for a really long time and a product that I think might be the coolest looking product we've ever developed. It's called Crumb Clay. Cheese. Yeah. I know, I wanted to make it look super different, I wanted to make it unique. The product itself is incredible, you guys are going to love it. It's like our clay, but a lot softer, a lot easier to use and manage. So it's for the everyday guy. While our extreme hold clay is a little bit tougher, it's for the more advanced guys. This one, any guy can use it. It's very easy to apply, great hold, matte finish, and of course the best looking hair product in the market. be honest no one is doing this this thing is really really sick. I'm blinded in me. I can just see guys like having this on their counter is being like proud to show this off. Kat what do you think? Amazing. Yeah? Look at that. Look at that glow. It's like golden, it's golden hour in the morning. You're like, whoa. Yeah. I love you guys. You're out. Connect, team bond, work, all the good stuff. Take care of the team. I'll see you.

        "transcript": " Good looking men make more money. If that statement frustrates you, that's okay. It's not a comfortable truth, but it's the truth. And as you're gonna see in this video, it's backed by a substantial amount of research. So today I wanna show you why that's the case. The research, the psychology and real world examples, so you can understand why and more importantly, how you can use it to your advantage. Now, before you think this is just about being born good looking, I'm gonna stop you right there. This isn't about having perfect features. This is about your image, something that you have a lot of control over. It's about how you show yourself to the world. And if you're showing up as the bad version of yourself, you're missing out on not just having a higher income, but plenty of other life opportunities too. There's this thing called the beauty premium. It basically means that people who are seen as good looking are usually treated better. There's another name for it nowadays. It's called pretty privilege. You may have heard of it. And you see pretty privilege every single day on your social media feed at work. And even in traffic, I mean, research shows that you're more likely to give way to a nicer car as opposed to an old beat up car. Studies in different areas like business, psychology show that pretty privilege is true. It's because of something called the halo effect. This is when we see one good thing about someone, like their looks, and we automatically think other good things about them. Like they're smart or trustworthy. It's like our brains take a shortcut to that quick judgment of character. So let's see how this works in real life. Imagine two people with the same skills applying for the same job. One is dressed up nicely, has nice hair, walks with confident posture. The other is dressed badly, his hair is messy and walks with bad posture. Who do you think the boss is more likely to hire? I mean, probably the first person, right? And by the way, it's not always on purpose. It's just how our brains work. This doesn't stop after you get the job. By the way, good-looking people might be more likely to get promoted or to get a raise, just because people think they're better at their job, even if that's not always true. If you have a job where you talk to customers, being good-looking can also help. People are more likely to trust and buy from someone they find attractive. So if you're in car sales, for example, you're probably gonna sell more cars just by maximizing your looks, the way that you style yourself your hair. Even when you meet new people, I mean, what's the very first thing that you notice about someone when you meet them? Usually it's how they look. It could be their height, it could be their face, or even their style. Your self-image can make it easier or harder to make friends, to make business connections. Actually, a study in Business Journal found that good-looking people make about three to 4% more money than people who are seen as less attractive. And I know that sounds like not much, but it can add up to a lot over your entire career. Another study shows an even bigger difference, with attractive people earning 5% more than average-looking people, and then less attractive people earning 5% to 10% less. So not only will you make more money when you're a good looking guy, you also make less than an average looking man if you're even less attractive than them. But let's get even more specific about why this happens. Who do people gravitate towards? Usually it's the people who look confident, who look well put together. People are just more likely to start a conversation with someone they find attractive. Even if you're not attracted to that person, you understand that this person is attractive to others. So you give this person a higher rating in where they stand in society. That higher rating can lead to new friendships, business connections, and more dating opportunities, of course. Studies even show that people tend to see attractive individuals as more effective leaders. So that can lead to them be chosen for leadership positions, even if they don't have more experience or skills. It's that halo effect at work again. Of course, in dating, the advantage is really obvious, especially in the age of online dating, right? Because first impressions are even more important. Your profile photo is the first thing that people see and it can make or break your chances of getting a match. People are just naturally drawn to attractive photos which can lead to more matches, more dates, and in general, more dating opportunities. Even in court, believe it or not, studies show that attractive defendants in court cases sometimes get lighter sentences than less attractive defendants for the same crimes. This shows just how deep this bias goes. And these biases, they're basically rooted in our psychology. We're drawn to signs of health, of energy, of good genes which we associate with physical attractiveness. it's a primal instinct and it's something that you need to be aware of so you can work on improving your looks and taking advantage of this instead of getting the short end of the stick. This isn't about giving up if you think that you're not naturally good looking. You can improve your image a lot and we've seen it over and over again. It all starts with your mindset and that's why I always recommend therapy which our sponsor BetterHelp offers from the convenience of your own home. A lot of men look down on therapy and think that it's for the weak, right? But it's actually the opposite. It takes strength. It takes confidence to do it. So change that mindset, start thinking of it as having someone on your team. It's a good time for you to talk through your thoughts without feeling embarrassed, without feeling intimidated in any way and better help makes it easy. You just click the first link below. You get connected with a therapist that's specialized in the area that you need help with. Maybe it's social anxiety, relationship issues, family issues. I'm telling you not dealing with it is not going to help. And it might sound like the easy way out by just not dealing with it, but you end up paying for it later in your life. Also, what man doesn't want to know more about himself hone in on his qualities, to be aware of his limitations so he can improve, right? That's what this channel is all about, personal growth, and therapy is a big part of that. You sign up online, you schedule sessions as a phone call, a video call, or even text message if you prefer so you don't have to sit in an awkward waiting room, it's on your schedule, and again, you can always stop if you don't like it, or swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which better help, offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. Just hear me out on this one, be open-minded, click that first link in my description, it's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta, and you even get a discount on your first month. And when it comes to your looks, the best way I've found of maximizing them is to do it in sections. Here's how you should go about it. First, take a really good look at your grooming routine. And what does that mean? Basically, do an assessment and see how your grooming looks. Good grooming is gonna be all about having clear skin, a great hairstyle that works for your face shape. Facial hair that enhances your looks, that makes your jawline look stronger. And even smelling good is considered good grooming. It's the basics, so that's why I recommend starting here. And by the way, I have a ton of videos teaching you how to do that. So I'm going to link a playlist below that goes over every single grooming tip that you're ever going to need. After grooming, take a good look at your personal style and your clothing. Because if you've learned anything on my YouTube channel, is that your clothes tell a story about you. Dressing well shows that you care about yourself, that you pay attention to details, and that you put effort into the things that you do. It's not about having a specific style. For example, it's not about always wearing a suit. It's knowing how to make your personal style look good, no matter your preference. So if you like street style, okay, cool. Then learn how to improve that style. If you like old money, then maximize that. Fashion used to be a lot more black and white, but nowadays it's a lot more dynamic. So you can have different styles as long as you know what you're doing. The next area you should improve is your body language and your confidence. How you stand, how you maintain eye contact during conversations and how you shake hands. That all shows how confident you are. And then of course, health and fitness. I mean, if you're healthy and fit, you're immediately put in a different category from someone who's unhealthy and overweight. without knowing anything else about these two people. We just assume that one has good habits, like eating clean, working out, having discipline, right? And then the other has bad habits, like eating fast food, waking up late, not having the willpower to overcome the challenge of being overweight. So immediately they're in completely different categories. And I just want to reiterate the fact that we know nothing about these two people. The fit guy could be an absolute piece of shit, and the overweight guy could be the best guy in the world. The point here is that if both of them had around the same rating for their personality, their social skills, their work skills. The healthy and fit guy has a huge advantage just by being fit. And studies show that confident people are more likely to get hired, to get promoted, to make more money. Over the years, I've realized that looking good is like food for your confidence. It feeds it, it makes your confidence grow. It's like that feeling you get when you leave the barber shop with a fresh haircut, or when you put on a tailored suit that fits you perfectly, or when you put on your favorite jacket before you leave your home. That feeling is exactly what I mean. By the way, I have a community only for men who want to improve their self-image. It's free to join, it's called Men's Image Lab, and I'm gonna link it below. Join, learn how to improve your looks, make friends. It's free, so there's literally no reason not to join. All right, let's get into how you actually improve your image. Here are some simple things that you can start doing today. First, like I said, fix your grooming. So let's focus on skincare. Wash your face, use a moisturizer, and apply sunscreen daily. It's as simple as that, and it's an easy routine that keeps your skin healthy and clear. Your hair, you're gonna need a good haircut that fits your face shape. Keep it clean, keep it style with good products. If you have facial hair, keep it trimmed, keep it neat, or if you wanna shave it off, you can do that as well. Shower often, use the odorant fragrances, brush your teeth. These are just like non-negotiable non-starters, right? Now when it comes to your style and your clothing, fit is gonna be key. Make sure that your clothes fit you well. Clothes that are too big, too baggy on you, or too small and tight on you, it just makes you look sloppy. Choose the right colors. Rain colors that look good with your skin tone in your hair color and define your personal style. Like I said, it doesn't have to be suits, right? It's just about understanding your personal style and improving it every single day. Oh, and a big one is dress for the occasion, wear appropriate clothing for different situations like work, dates or casual outings. Those are all gonna be different types of style. Then look at your body language and your confidence. Stand up straight because good posture makes you look more confident. Make sure that you're looking people in the eye to show that you're engaged, show that you're interested. Smiling is gonna make you look more approachable, more friendly. And of course, take a good look at your health and fitness. Eat healthy, eating nutritious foods. That's going to give you the energy that you need. It makes you look and feel better. You also have to make sure that you're working out, exercising, being active. Exercise helps you stay in shape. It improves your mood and it boosts your confidence and get enough sleep. A lot of people sleep on sleep. Sleep is important for your physical and your mental health. So make sure that you're getting seven to eight hours every single night. By the way, this isn't about becoming someone you're not. It's about becoming the best version of yourself. It's about unlocking your full potential and giving yourself every advantage that you can. You deserve to feel confident and successful and improving your image is a big step in that direction."

        "transcript": " 2025 is here. So I want to make sure that you look your absolute best, update your closet with the trends that are going to dominate this year. If you're still stuck wearing skinny jeans or those crazy oversized streetwear trends, this video is for you. I'm going to break down the best men's fashion trends of 2025. They're practical, they're stylish, and guaranteed to make you look your best. Look, skinny jeans were all the hype in 2015 to 2019 or so, right? Then we overcorrected by going extra baggy. That dominated the fashion scene up until now. But in 2025, we're going to see that trend fade. Thankfully, we're not going back to skin tight uncomfortable pants. This year we're finally getting back to normalcy. It's all about straight cut pants that leave some room for your body parts, but don't go overboard. And you know what? I'm so happy that we're finally over the extremes from both sides of skinny, skinny tight pants, and then the overly baggy stuff. I'm excited to wear jeans like Levi's 501s. They have a timeless straight leg fit that looks great. And the best part is that they will literally last you forever because this isn't a fat like the skinnies or the extra baggy pants This is a classic APC also has some really nice clean high quality denim that will fit you really well Every lane made well also has their 1991 jeans that are high quality and even suit supply has great jeans in that straight leg fit that look really nice And in terms of the wash I mean the way I look at it is the lighter the wash the more casual the jeans so so light wash denim is great but they're gonna be more casual than a pair of dark wash denim. Ideally you have one of each so you can add some style versatility to your closet. The sporty preppy vibe is gonna be huge in 2025. Think varsity jackets, college sweaters, and accessories like retro sneakers. This style basically combines nostalgia with modern tailing. And you know who pulls this off really well is Timothy Chalamet. He's the definition of cool, casual, and it works. Some key pieces that I'd recommend are varsity jackets from Ralph Lauren or even a million-door has great ones too. Cable knit sweaters have that preppy vibe and they just add such a nice texture to your outfit. A lot of men forget to play with texture and so the outfit can become a little stale or boring. Texture will add a nice element to your outfit and cable knit sweaters are an easy way to achieve that. Classic sneakers like the New Balance 550s, the Adidas Sambas, obviously you're seeing these everywhere and you're going to continue to see them in 2025. For something more high end, I would I would say the Mason Margiela replica sneakers are super hot right now. I see people wearing them every single day here in New York City. I also see this trend in workout outfits. For example, Nike Vintage Windbreakers, right? They're very colorful usually, and I know some guys are scared of adding color to their outfits, which is understandable, but for a workout outfit, it doesn't really matter. You know, it's a good stepping stone in your style journey. It's less risky to wear a fun workout outfit versus wearing a ton of color when you're going out to a nice restaurant, for example, which is a lot tougher to pull off. The style journey is something that I talk a lot about because I've gone through it. I had no idea what I was wearing in my 20s. I was just winging it. And through my style journey of researching, trying new things outside of my comfort zone, I found my style. Now, some of those things worked and some of those looked absolutely horrible and I have pictures to prove it, but those style mistakes helped me hone in on what really works for me. And if you're going through the same style journey right now, I have a free community with 5,000 guys who are doing the same exact thing. Some are just starting somewhere further ahead, but we're all there for the same reason to help each other out. It's called men's image lab. And like I said, it's free. I'm going to link it in the description. Just last year, I found myself wearing more and more knitwear. I just naturally gravitated towards knit polos like this knit polo, for example, sweaters, et cetera. And then now I can confidently say that knitwear is having a moment. And we're not talking about your grandpa's sweaters. All right, this year, textured knits are stepping up in every form, from sweaters to cardigans to polos, even knit trousers. I mean, just look at Michael B. Jordan, whether it's a chunky knit sweater or a slim fit knit polo, he shows how versatile this trend can be. And knitwear adds depth to your outfit. It keeps it cozy. It keeps it stylish. Again, adding that texture that I talked about to your look. A lot of brands to check out here because this is so popular right now, but cost has has great minimalist textured knits. Reese has elegant fitted knit polos. Todd Snyder has those elevated cardigans that don't feel too old fashioned. And a pro tip here is play with those textures. The ribbed knits, the waffle patterns, the cable designs, just have fun with it, add those details to your outfit. And trust me when I say that texture is gonna bring your outfit to life. If you start paying attention to your favorite influencers and even some runway shows, you're gonna see that there's one item that keeps popping up over and over again. Yes, vests are making a big comeback and no, they're not just for Wall Street bankers, all right? The finance bros. The vest is getting a modern versatile update in 2025. A tailored vest over a crisp shirt is timeless. But look at these outfits from Suit Supply. They're classy, they're timeless, but they're not boring, right? Now look at these street style outfits with vests. No matter your personal style, you can make vests work. They have them in every color, every pattern, design. you can make it casual, you can dress it up. It's the perfect piece for the upcoming spring season because you know what, it adds a nice layer to your outfit without overheating it, right? It's easy to wear and it looks great. So the styles to consider here are gonna be a tailored vest from let's say, suit supply, Reese, right? For a smart casual outfit. You can go for a puffer vest for a sporty vibe. It's perfect for this transitional weather. Abercrombie, Zara, you know, they all have really nice puffer vests or fashion forward vests, if you wanna stand out, if you're that kind of guy. Okay, this next trend, I've been preaching about this for a long time, and if you haven't jumped on this trend yet, now is the perfect time. And that's because, you know what, men tend to have such tunnel vision when it comes to footwear. You can't just wear sneakers. Guys, you have to diversify, you have to change it up. You have to make it interesting. So trust me on this one, loafers are stealing the spotlight as the ultimate footwear choice for this year. They're versatile, they're sleek, they work for both casual and dressed up looks. David Beckham is a big fan of loafers, any fashion influencer that talks about old money aesthetics, you're going to see they wear loafers. And even the street wear guys are starting to style loafers with casual outfits. So if you're still on the fence, I'm going to show you how to start because I know that buying your first pair of loafers can be intimidating for some guys. Here's the truth, just go with the classics. They don't fail. Black leather, not too bulky like these, but not as slim and dressy as these. Start with something in between, like these or these. They're easier to style with jeans, with trousers, with suits, whatever your style is. And of course, there's a ton of variety when it comes to loafers. You can go for penny loafers, for a classic vibe, tassel loafers for a more playful twist, chunky loafers for a modern, edgy look, and you have brands like GH Bass, Tods, Thursday Boots, even Doc Martens. And loafers tie into this overall style trend that we're gonna be seeing in 2025. If there's one trend that you need to master this year, it's smart casual. It's the perfect balance between casual and professional. think long sleeve polos, knitwear, tailored trousers, loafers, tailored vests. These are all part of this big shift that we're seeing towards smart casual. I'm a fan of this trend. It's masculine, it's mature, it's classic, but it's not boring, it's not stuffy. What's not to like? I noticed that my closet shifted heavily towards this trend and honestly, I see more and more guys doing the same because people are tired of looking sloppy. We wanna look good, we wanna be taken seriously, but without the crazy logos, without the graphics, It's got the baggy fits that can look and feel childish and mature. And some of the brands for smart casual staples that you should look at are suit supply, of course, for blazers or honestly, they're crushing it right now. You can find anything there. Uniqlo has affordable options for pretty much everything and Reese is one of my favorite brands. This jacket is actually from Reese right now. I mean, my pro tip for you when it comes to smart casual is gonna be focus on fit. Yes, of course, the design is great, but it's gonna be simple, right? That's the whole point. Focus on fit. If you're more advanced, focus on fabric as well. Those are the two things that are gonna bring this style together for you. And this whole smart casual trend brings us to a trend that's more of a downtrend, actually, the decline of designer branded clothing. Anything with big designer logos like Gucci T-shirts, Balenciaga hoodies, these are becoming more and more tacky every single day. And honestly, designer brands in general, if you take a look at it now, they're having a hard time. Their sales are at a decline, which hasn't really happened at this scale in a long time. And sure, there's other factors like economic uncertainty, the world is kind of a crazy place right now. So consumers are tightening their wallets, right? Spending less. But consumers are also starting to notice the lack of value for the high price points of those luxury goods that are all branded. Why would I pay $620 for a t-shirt that promotes Gucci? You kind of turn into a walking ad for them and you're paying them so much for what costs them probably a few dollars if that, let's be real, right? So designers are out this year and the ones that are going to continue to grow are going to be designer brands like Loro Piana that don't focus on logos but they focus on fabric, fit, quality of garment. We're seeing the same happening with that brand, The Rowe, right? They're expensive but they're booming right now and that's because they're not focusing on logos and they're not just marking things up because of the logo. You know what else I've been seeing a lot more of is high-waisted trousers. They're back and they're actually more flattering than you might think. I know it sounds weird. Most guys don't really wear high-waisted pants, but they elongate your legs, right? They give you a retro, a masculine look, and it's pretty subtle. It's actually more subtle than you think. Think of Brad Pitt in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, for example. High-waisted pants, paired with a tucked-in shirt or a sweater, it really creates a nice silhouette and it makes your proportions look amazing, especially if you have a long torso or short legs. This is gonna help you balance your proportions. Some tips from my guys who want to try high waisted pants, pair them with loafers for a nice polished look. You can stick to neutral colors like tan, navy or gray for more versatility. And in terms of brands, I mean, they're pretty much everywhere because they are trendy right now. But look at Mango Man, Todd Snyder, Suit Supply, Roth Loren, all of these brands are going to have it. These are the best men's fashion trends for 2025. And I made sure to include something for every style, every personality. The key here is to choose trends that work for you and then incorporate them into your existing wardrobe. Let me know which trend you're gonna be wearing this year and don't forget to join Man's Image Lab right below. I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Last time we cut it, we left it pretty long up top and then we just cut it kind of this side from back. Right. I think I want to go a little bit shorter, more manageable, so pretty tight. Over right, even on top? Yeah, even on top. I mean, we can do like, I still obviously want some length to be able to style it, like you know, like that. But it's just a little too bulky and it keeps falling. Right. Yeah, all right. So they're gonna decide in the bag you want to go like tapered at the back or Keep it a little blank like straight a little bit of length. Yeah, we could maybe even no I think keep the length not tapered. All right. Yeah That boy looking fresh, new cut. Finally, I know in the last video or two vlogs ago I got a haircut and I was trying to let it grow a little bit longer but it's just a little too much. So I like it short like this. I'm vibing with this haircut. I'm going to keep it short for a little while. Even though people usually in the winter let their hair grow. I know. I like it clean, sharp looking. And there's just something special about going into a barber shop and they're using my grooming products for tits. I don't know, like every time he pulls it out I'm like, I just get a big smile on my face. I feel just blessed. I feel good, man. Today's essentially the last day of work for everybody. I'm going to Florida tomorrow to see my family. So today is just really about wrapping up, you know, loose ends, making sure everything is ready so that I can leave and see my family and enjoy the holidays without having to work too too much. Yeah, and then you feel free to book the hotel. So the hotel will need the two rooms, one for me, one for Rodrigo, for yeah, 14th to 17th, so one, two, three nights. What we want to do in Vancouver is I want to present, I want to prepare a presentation, So a deck to present the team for Forte, right? And in this presentation, I want to go over the importance of social media for Forte series, the difference it's made so far for our brand, where we're going next with socials for Forte, specifically building community. Right? So how can we build a really strong, tight knit community of guys who are here to elevate themselves, want to look good, want their hairstyles to be great, want to put their best face forward, their best self forward. How can we build that community and make it really fun for people to join? So it's not just customers, right? We're building community. What are you working on? Literally just wrapping things up so I can go on this trip tomorrow and not have to work for at least the weekend. Go to I'm going to Tampa tomorrow. My mom lives in Tampa with my two brothers and my stepdad. Christmas last year was here in New York City, which was really fun, but this year it's going to be a warm Christmas. We're going to Tampa. Oh, by the way, I'm not the only one who got a haircut today. Truffle got a haircut yesterday. He got a haircut yesterday and he's coming to Tampa. There's an even no idea, but he's going to be on the plane first thing tomorrow morning. There's a little bit of drama going on here, to be honest with you guys. So the weight limit is 20 pounds dog plus carrier and he is like 19 and a half pounds right now after the haircut. The carrier is definitely not like half a pound so he's going to be slightly over the limit weight wise. So I'm scared. We're flying business. It should be okay but at the same time, I don't know if we get there tomorrow and they don't allow him into the plane, I'm a little worried just because I don't know what else we would do if we would drive 17 hours to Florida. That would be crazy. So look really small tomorrow. Just think small. All right. Mom was packed. I have my toiletries and workout clothes left and I'm gonna be writing these tomorrow which I'm really excited for because this is an A6 and Ayrton-Sana collaboration for Brazilians watching this, I'm from Brazil so this was like a really cool collaboration for me to see I just had to get this because this is basically Minma King Erdan Senna's McLaren back in the day I'm a huge F1 fan obviously as a Brazilian I'm a huge Formula 1 fan and Erdan Senna fan You like it? Do you approve? Yes, he's Brazilian He is, he's you're half Brazilian Snowing outside, making a coffee, and we gotta get out of here. It's 7.40, we're supposed to leave here right at 8am, and because of the snow I think we're gonna try to leave right now. I woke up and when I saw the snow outside I was like, I gotta take Truffle out there, because he's never seen snow, so we took him out and he was running around going crazy. He loved it. He had snow all over his face. He actually jumped into the bushes one time, it was super funny. But now it's time to settle him down, put him into the carrier, and hopefully everything will be okay. We're actually pretty nervous just because we've never flown with a dog before and he's at the cusp of his weight limit so ah fingers crossed everything is okay. All right off we go. You're okay, baby. We did it. This little guy's sleeping. He's feeling good. He's been so chill. We got through the... TSA people were super lovely. They were very nice to him. They loved him. And now we're over here just about to go into the lounge. He's been really calm, just so nice. He's just hanging out and giving him a little treat right now. He likes to lick this treat and just chill. And he's just chilling. And he's just chilling. And he's just chilling. And he's just chilling. He's so tired. I think he's gonna sleep the whole plane ride. I think so too. He like ran him outside before we came here. Make sure he was really tired, exercised. Now he's chilling. Florida was actually really really nice, you know. You know, it's the only time of the year that I can actually put down my laptop, not really work, enjoy my family. It was really nice to be able to see my mom meeting Truffle as a puppy because, you know, he's four months old now and pretty soon the next time she sees Truffle, he's going to be full grown. So it was nice for them to get to see Truffle, my mom, my two brothers, my stepdad as a puppy. I had a really chill time in my mom's place. We really just went out as a family. We went to see Wicked the movie. We went to some nice restaurants and then we threw truffle into the pool. We just wanted to see how he would do. You know, if we don't have a pool here in New York City and it's obviously very cold. So it was nice to get him outdoors, nice to get him into the water just to see how he would do. All right, we're going to teach you how to swim today, man. You're kidding me. He's standing on his high egg. Boy. Good boy. Wow. Good boy. Wow. Good boy. So good. Is that okay? Really proud of you, bud. You did so good. I think that's it for today. That's enough. Enough exposure for one day. It was also Emily's first time in Tampa in my mom's place. It was really special. We exchanged gifts as a family. and overall it was just a really good experience and a really good way to reset before the end of the year in the beginning of 2025. Is that truffle? There you go, Mac. There you go. Did you get it, Brett? Dick's Sporting Goods. Yeah. I want to get some new athleisure. That's something I love, this playing the board. I love that pleasure. I got a present for you. You and Emily? There we go. I think this is gonna go great in the house. Be a nice addition. Oh, truffle. Look at what you got. You got a frisbee. This is for you. Say thank you. And this is for you. You and Dillicy? Truffle. Thank you, Adam. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Wow. Thank you. What are those? Sanlon, right? Thank you. Thank you. Very fancy. Just like me. Oh. So as you can see, the trip turned out to be really all about truffle, way less about us. But then on the flight back, we'd get to the window to check in and we're checking in. trying to talk to the guy, make good rapport, and he just wasn't giving anything back to me. I'm like, Merry Christmas, how was it, whatever. It was just being very dry to me. And he's like, all right, put your dog on the scale. And we put him on the scale. The max weight allowed is 20 pounds with the carrier. Truffle is 20 pounds. The carrier itself is a little bit heavier too. So it ended up being 23 and a half pounds. And he's like, can I please see the dog? So he looks at the dog, he's like, yeah, it's a little crammed in there. I'm gonna have to call the supervisor. And Truffle is literally chilling. So I don't, we were like, all right, whatever, call the supervisor. Supervisor came out, Emily and I are sweating at this point. We're like, what if we can't bring him back? It's a 20 hour drive. Supervisor comes out and she's in a great mood. And even though we were scared, she was like, oh, he's so cute, he's adorable. Is he gonna be okay in the carrier? We're like, yes, he's gonna sleep the whole time. And she let us go. It all worked out, but man, it was definitely stressful. It was also the first and last time that we're going to fly with him in a carrier because he's now 24 pounds without the carrier. The dude is growing so fast. Yeah, you bring shorts? I did. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. One more petto. Just a touch up. Today. Quick. Easy one. Getting some tattoos. Actually, I'm not getting anything new. we touch the tattoo, the last tattoo that Oscar gave me. So Oscar did my whole leg sleeve on my right leg that you guys have seen already. And now we're just gonna, we touch some of that work. We're doing the mom tattoo, right? Superman. Yes. The rival back piece. Yes. The rival back piece. Coming up. Are you nervous? Honestly, I haven't even had time to think about it. Because I just got back last night and then today had a busy day. And then I'm like, oh, shit, I gotta go get tattooed. I'm not that nervous though, just because I've gotten so many before. That's just, the foot is a little sensitive, but it's so small on the foot that it doesn't really matter. You don't have any right. No, I wanna get some though, I'm not sure. Your mom would kill you though. No. No. I don't know, is it worth it? You know, they'll get over it sooner or later. It's how it goes. We won't talk for a year. Yeah, and then we'll be good. Time heals all wounds, you know? She didn't talk to you for how long when you got earrings? Three weeks. Three weeks. That too will be three months. Yeah, three months. It's OK. Three months in New York working, you know? Let her. Yeah, you don't even see her for every three months anyway. Do it like if you want to do it now, you just got back today from your family house. Do it now because then you're not going to see her for three months anyway. Best in the biz right here guys. Best in the biz, Oscar. When I saw his work, I was like, damn it looks so sick. And then one of my buddies got a sleeve done by him. And I'm not gonna lie, he told me the price and I was like, I can't afford that. I was like that. I can't afford, he's the best. He's the best and I'm not ready yet. So, you know, when I started making real money, I was like, all right, I'm gonna go back to Oscar, which now I can afford. I'm so glad I did because when it comes to a tattoo, you just want the best. [\"Best\"] Oscar's a man. guys ever need the best, that's Oscar, the best. Like I've searched, I wanted to get the best of the best tattoo me and when I saw Oscar I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna wait until I can afford this guy and I'm so glad I did because just unbelievable. It's not just the technique, you know, the fine lines or whatever, it's also one the person, really great guy, really nice guys, you saw the energy is amazing. They're spending a lot of time with this guy. Like I would spend sometimes 12 hours with him at a time. Right? But he's a master of just creating the spacing, the placement, the perfect placement for each tattoo. That for me is what did it. It was like, he is the God at that. So yeah, if you guys ever need it, Oscar or Carimbo, I'll link this Instagram below. First workout of the year. Slocked a little bit the first couple of days. I was, I had a good excuse. I was violently hungover, to be honest with you. Had a lot of fun New Year's Eve. We had a lot of friends over. We had a private chef come and cook for us, it was great. And then we went to a club here in New York City, with a bunch of our friends. Had the best time, with the countdown, had some fun, then came back to my place, had an after party. It was, it was a really great experience. And I don't know, to me New Year's is just such good time to spend with friends or family and just start the year off with the right people. Could have probably drank a little bit less, but if it was worth it. Had a nice chill day, January 1st, relaxed, didn't do much. And then, yeah, now it's time to get to work. And today we're doing back, we're doing biceps, and we're doing a little bit of abs. We're gonna start with lat pull downs. This is one of my favorite exercises for back and it just feels so good on the lats. Then gonna go on to pull ups. Then after that we're doing single arm dumbbell rows. Then one of my least favorite exercises is lat palm downs. I don't know why I just don't like these. They burn but they're also really good in that sense. It's a good burn. Then we'll go on to biceps and do bicep curls and then hanging leg raises to finish it all off. You tell me what you think. It's an extension of what you're doing and what I want to talk about for the off-site. Some of the like areas of high leverage that we have for growth in my opinion are going to be paid media, TikTok shopping, phones and partnerships, Amazon, barber shops and retailers. It starts with the content and then it grows the audience. It grows our paid media chances and rola's and then of course it gives us more shots at growing on Amazon and getting into a retailer. Let's split it between, let's say, you're more so your side and more so like the forte, or I can just say my side. The founder of us, I think it would be more on your side where you have more creative control. Is it, I mean, that can give you some knowledge regarding what is resonating, but other than that, like you'll be scripting and you will be mostly handling the person around presentation, right? Yeah, yeah, for sure. That's what we're doing now with the behind the scenes the vlogs, I want to focus on like how we're building Forte. And I want to even kind of create a challenge around it for us to be like, almost like a series, right? Like, oh, building Forte to 50 million or building Forte into a $100 million brand. And that's kind of like the, the common thread throughout all of these videos. Yeah. So that's the goal. Yeah. I feel like people are going to like this one right here. Honestly, I'm going to do a few for summer, a few for fall. Definitely this one. Yeah. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and of course, eight. These are the eight fragrances that I'm going to recommend my audience for 2025. It's always stuff because like, I mean there's so many fragrances and obviously so many of you guys that watch. So it's kind of hard to find the exact fragrances. I feel very responsible because I don't want to recommend you guys to lead you towards something that you're not going to like. So every time I choose these fragrances, every year I do this list of best fragrances for the year. It's a little intimidating because I want to make sure that you guys really enjoy the fragrances so this is the list by the time you watch this the video is going to be out already but we're going to shoot the footage of the fragrances right now yeah it's done right here whoo it's bright yeah that's super bright that changed quick It's like a cozy fragrance I feel like with the wood and the guitar. It's got that cozy vibe. It's really reflective so let me know if you want to moot around a little bit. Let's do something like that and just hold it a little bit more straight. Yep. Turn it a little bit this way. How's the reflection? It's good. Action. Dance. Keeps changing. Hey, Manny, how's it going? Hey, doing great. How about you? How's the yarn? It's cold. It's really cold. Let's go over the goals. I added everything into the brain dump board and then categorized a lot of them already. So I think on this call would be beneficial is if we actually took all of the goals that we categorized and put them into the quarter timeline sorting. So let's start with your personal goals. Yeah, so I think for the Brazil podcast tour, let's do Q4 because I'm going to be in Brazil anyway. So I'm thinking I'll just do a longer stint there and then just reach out to all the guys there and go on a media tour. Donated charity this year. I would say put that in Q1 so we can kind of just start with that. Yeah, so launch six SKUs. Let's just break that down into quarters. So Q1, let's launch three SKUs for Forte. So now that we have most of the goals already lined up, what we should do is schedule a monthly review of the goals. So every month put out a calendar to review all of these goals. And I can just do it on my own. So every year I like to take a long time to refresh my goals, to go through what I accomplished in the previous year, what I failed in the previous year. And I used to do that here on this passion planner. I've been using a passion planner for probably seven years. I have seven of these. And the problem with these, I love it, but the problem with this is that it's physical, which means if I'm on a trip somewhere, or even if I'm out of my apartment somewhere, I don't have access to it. I do take a photo of my goals once I write them, but it's not enough. So this year we're going digital. There's so many project management platforms out there that it's going to be easier that way. Anywhere I am, I can just hop on the app and see where I'm at with the goals. And then you have access to all of those goals throughout the year is moving forward. And the way that I did it is first I brainstormed all of my goals, whether they were personal, forte, Alex cost the social media business and put everything into my brainstorming section. Then I categorized them. So if it's a forte goal, I put them into the forte board, personal goal, personal goal. If it's a goal for my social media business, then I put it there and then I go deeper and take those goals and give them a timeline. So I put them into Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and then into each month of the year. That way I'm giving myself the right timeline and I know when I want to hit those goals by. I think a lot of people make the mistake of just putting their goals into a piece of paper, giving yourself a timeline or schedule, not really being too specific with what the goal is, when you want to hit that goal by some of the goals. I don't mind sharing them with you guys. So my personal goals, some of the ones that I wrote down, go on a podcast tour in Brazil. If you don't know, I'm Brazilian, so I want to go back and I want to go back to my roots and just talk to everyone there. I have a lot of friends in the media space. So I want to go on some podcasts, tell my story, talk about my experience here in the US as a Brazilian entrepreneur. I want to spend some time in the Hamptons with my friends this summer. So I want to rent a house in the Hamptons with myself, my girlfriend, bring my dog, truffle with some entrepreneurs and do a nice little retreat in the Hamptons. I want to take my family on a really nice, luxurious trip this year. It's something that we've been talking about for a while. And honestly, work gets in the way, whether it's me or my family. So this year, I want to make sure that that happens. I want to get into Nordstrom stores. We're currently in talks with them, which is really, really exciting for me, which is gonna be the beginning of our retailer plan. So we definitely want to be in brick and mortar as pretty soon. I wanna create more founder content showing you guys, you know, what I'm doing with Forte, what my team is doing to grow the company and just opening up a little bit more with you when it comes to how we're building this company. Show you exactly how I'm building this company as opposed to just being more surface level, which sometimes I tend to do. Yeah, I wanna go deeper and I think you guys will appreciate it. I want to double our Amazon monthly sales by the end of the year. It's a hefty goal. For my social media business, which is a business that takes up most of my time at the moment, one of the goals is for it to not take as much time in 2025. I want to automate it as much as I can. I want to hire eight players so that they can come in and help me run this social media business in a more smooth structured manner so I can put more time and effort into growing forte. I want every single video on my YouTube channel to hit 100,000 views within the first seven days of me uploading, which honestly, I used to do that. And then honestly, post videos that we're proud of, you know, I want every video to be better than the last, I want to be inspired by the videos that I create. I want to be happy with the videos that we're posting and the vlogs have been so refreshing to me. For men's image lab, which is my community for men who want to improve their self image, I'll link it below for you guys. It's free. I want to get the free group to 15,000 members. Now, I could literally do that tomorrow if I wanted to. The problem is I want the right 15,000 members. We have, we have 3,000 membership requests right now and we're not letting them in just because we don't think it's the right time or the right type of member for Men's Image Lab at the moment. And these are just some of my goals. Of course, I have a lot more. They're way more specific, you know, revenue driven, very clear KPIs for the team, but I'm just sharing with you what I think is suitable here for the vlog. We put a lot of time into creating that board that you saw here that I'm doing for my plans. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to give it to you as a gift. If you want to use it, I know it's a little late into the year, so I apologize. But if you want to use it to create your goals, it's very specific and it's going to help you visualize not just every month, not just every quarter, but your entire 2025. I'm going to link that below. You can just click on the link and get the free template. Overall, I have a really good feeling about 2025. I think it's going to be great. There's a lot of changes happening, not just to my business, but also to my personal life. So I'm excited and I'm rooting for you. I hope that you have the best year of your life yet. So have an amazing year and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Let's be real, men's hairstyles have had some questionable moments. We've all tried to forget bull cuts, frosted tips, right? But the good news is that 2025 is all about taking men's hair to the next level. From bold new trends to the refined classics, today we're diving into the most popular men's hairstyles of 2025 with everything you need to know about styling them. And the first hairstyle on today's list is a modern hairstyle. It's a hairstyle that just started popping up everywhere. A lot of the Gen Z guys are wearing this type of hairstyle right now. It's called the Mini Mullet. Now let's go over the specifics. The sides are tight, could be a fade, it could be a classic taper, the choice is actually yours. You can customize it. The back has a little bit of length, right? So about one to two inches past the natural hairline, which gives it that subtle, let's call it party in the back look. And the top is gonna be three to five inches with texture, loads of texture, which by the way is gonna be a recurring theme here. A lot of the hairstyles that are popular right now have a lot of this texture that I'm talking about. And it has a volume for that style of versatility. This is a really cool hairstyle for a lot of the younger guys. It's a modern take on the mullet. The mullet is becoming more and more refined. So that's why it's called the mini mullet. And this one is for the risk takers, right? For the trendsetters. And for anyone who's just a cool guy, I mean, think street wear enthusiasts, musicians, artists, creatives. The mini mullet is blowing up on TikTok right now on indie films. It makes it a staple for Gen Z in fashion forward millennials and it suits oval and heart-shaped faces the best. You have a few options to style it, but it's actually pretty easy because the cut is short. So you have between three to five inches. And going with the trend of Gen Z laid back, easy to style, this is one of those hairstyles that is pretty easy to style. And you can go two ways. You can go with a clay, like the Forte series texture clay for extreme hold, matte finish, loads of texture. You can just rub a little bit of your into your hands and then scrunch it into your hair. Or you can also go with the texture volume powder, which is very easy. You basically just spritz a little bit onto your hair and then massage your scalp. And it adds loads of volume and texture to the top. Now we're going from something pretty edgy like the mini mullet to something classy. And a new take on the classic look, which is the 80-20 side part. This hairstyle is basically a side part, but the 80-20 refers to the asymmetry of the part. So you're not just parting your hair here. You're giving 20% on one side of the part and then 80% on the other side. You can leave the sides as long as you want. You can go for faded, you can go for an undercut vibe if you want, or you can leave a little bit of length like I have it here myself. Up top, you can go from three inches all the way to five and six inches if you really want a nice flowy side part. But the most important part will be that asymmetry of the part, which gives it that classic style with a modern twist. So who's this hairstyle for? Well, it's for the professionals, the polished gentlemen, the guys who want to look cool without trying too hard. Whether you're in finance, law, or you just love tailored looks, if you like the old money aesthetic, the 80-20 is clean, it's timeless, it's gaining a lot of traction with young professionals on TikTok as well. I've posted a lot of videos about it and people seem to really be drawn to the 80-20 side part. And if you have a square or oval face shape, you're in luck, this is the perfect hairstyle for that type of face shape. To style it, it's actually very, very easy. So you're gonna part your hair, instead of parting it where you usually part a side part, come in 20% higher. So the smaller part is gonna have a little bit more weight to it. Use a comb, find that, comb it over, to make that division, divide it properly, and then you're gonna use either the Forte series styling cream or the pomade if you want a little bit of shine, right? I'm wearing the pomade right now. You can see it has a little bit of that natural shine which I personally like for a hairstyle like this because it makes it look classier. It makes it look more traditional. And by the way, I'm listing all of the products that I'm mentioning in this video in the description below. And Forte Series is having a new year, new year sale happening right now over the next three to four days, depending on when this video goes live. So make sure that you go check it out and don't miss on the sale because we rarely have sales. This is something special. It's a new year and you want to look your best. So if you haven't tried the brand yet, This is the perfect time to do it. And if you want to restock, if you're running low on your 14 series products, then it's the perfect time to re-up. Everything is listed below. Before this next hairstyle, you're not gonna need any products. Why? Because this next hairstyle is the most masculine, the easiest to maintain, the bust cuts. It's as simple as it gets. It's a uniform cut, using a number one to number three clipper guard. You just pair it with a high fade if you want, a little, you know, fun design. If you want, I'm not a fan. I prefer the classic buzz cut. I think it looks so good. Some people like to, you know, go blonde with it, play around with it, but honestly, you can never, ever go wrong with a buzz cut. You get the benefit of not having to do anything with it when you wake up, you already look handsome. And it's always gonna be trendy. It's always gonna be popular because of that. It's for the gym rats, it's for the athletes, it's for the military guys, anyone who wants zero maintenance. It's also perfect for guys who are thinning or looking for a fresh start. And it's perfect for you guys that have an oval face shape or a square face shape. If you have a round face shape, I probably would stay away from the bus cut, for example, because it would make your face look extra round. And like I said, to style it, you don't have to do anything. The one thing I will say is make sure that your hair is healthy, all right? So just because you have a bus cut, doesn't mean that you should stop taking care of your hair and scalp. Definitely shampoo and conditioner, and you can even use the Forte series Argan Oil to keep your scalp healthy, to add a subtle shine, to make sure that your hair and scalp are looking healthy. One of my favorite haircuts and hairstyles right now is going to be the medium length curls. Curls are in, we know that, we've heard the saying, curls get girls all year long and it's gonna be no different in 2025. The difference is in 2024, a lot of the curly cuts were short, like a French crop or like a curly undercut. Now we're going into a little bit more length. So for this one, the top is gonna be four to six inches to showcase, to really highlight those curls. And the sides are gonna be slightly shorter, but still long, right? They're not gonna be faded. They're not gonna be super tight. And this cut works whether you have loose waves or you have tight curls. And when I look at guys who are wearing this type of cut, I'm seeing creatives. I'm seeing the guys who like a coffee shop, artists. All right, it's the kind of laid back guy who wants that cool effortless look. It's really popular amongst musicians who really embrace their natural hair texture, who want something different, who don't want to look stuffy with like a side part or stuffy with something that's too classic. And in terms of face shape, if you have oval, diamond or heart face shape, this is going to work really, really well for you. Now of course, the longer the hair, typically the more maintenance you have to do to make sure that it looks great, right? If you've seen my long hair, I've had the man bun, I've had the top knot, I can tell you right now it's definitely way more work than having shorter hair. So if you want longer curls, of course, you're just gonna have to put a little bit more effort into it. So definitely use the Forte series hydrating Argan oil every single day, just a few drops to tame the frizz, to define your curls. This is one of our best selling products, which is so interesting to me because it's a hair oil for men. And every guy that uses it says the same thing, this changed my hair. So use some of that and then apply the styling cream onto your damp hair and just lightly scrunch it into place, let it air dry to maintain those natural curls to maintain that texture and it's gonna look amazing. Moving on to one of my favorite hairstyles I have had this hairstyle multiple times it's called the flow. It actually has a bunch of different names I feel like the name changes all the time it goes from middle part to the flow to long and wavy whatever you want to call it. At the end of the day it's a longer hairstyle six to eight inches it has movement it has volume it has nice texture right not as much as the curl but it does have that nice texture. And the sides in the back are gonna be kind of tucked behind the ears for that clean but still laid back style as if you just kind of like pulled your hair back. You're not really trying too hard. It just looks good because you're a handsome guy and it's easy for you. Now who is this hairstyle for? Honestly, this is a hairstyle that works for everyone because it can be casual and it can be dressed up. I have seen and have done it myself. I have worn this hairstyle with suits, right? and it works really, really well, as long as you pull it back with your hands, kind of like slick it back, especially on the sides and the back with some type of pomade. Now, surfers are gonna have this hairstyle. Skaters, free spirits, and then professional guys that are going into the office every day as long as you style it properly, as long as your hair is healthy. And it works really well for oval, square, or oblong face shapes. There's one trick that's gonna completely change this hairstyle and make it come to life, And that's using a thickening spray to add that thickness, that flow, that volume into your hair. So you shower, your hair is damp, you spray the Forte series thickening spray, don't go overboard, I would say three to five sprays max, because it is really strong. You're gonna see it when you use it. That adds volume and it adds a light hold to your hair. And then another way to style it that makes it even easier is by using the Forte series sea salt spray. A sea salt spray is gonna add definition. It's going to add waves and curls. When I was doing research for this video, one of the hairstyles that kept popping up, and I actually couldn't really believe it, was a greasy type of hairstyle. It's so funny how things just come and go. So now we're seeing a greasy type of trend. Again, we're like back in the 70s when guys used to just slick their hair back. Of course, this is a modern approach, a modern take on this. And it's kind of inspired by Michelle Morone, this handsome guy right here that the ladies go crazy for. So basically you have that greasy hairstyle and you have some strands kind of falling on your forehead. It is a longer hairstyle as well. I'd say four to six, maybe seven inches up top with tapered sides. Obviously you put effort into your hair. If you think Michelle Marrone didn't put effort into his hair, you're crazy, right? But it looks rebellious. It looks like he's a gangster. It looks like he's this cool guy who just like has cool hair. In reality, we know he spent a lot of time making sure that it looks perfect. So I'm calling it, this hairstyle is gonna be all over social media in 2025. And it's for the kind of guys who like to be a little bit more bold, who like the leather jackets, who like to be a little bit more fashion forward, but also like to wear the type of shirt that is missing a few buttons. It's really great for square, diamond and oval face shape. And the best way to style it is gonna be a simple two step process, one forte series oil to add that shine to your hair and then follow up with the pomade. The pomade is what I'm wearing right now. It adds a little bit extra shine because you want that greasy look. And I would actually do it while your hair is still a little bit damp to make use of that natural water type of shine because if you dry your hair and it's really dry and then you apply the pomade it might not be as shiny as you want. Or if your hair is already dry and you want to style it and make it a little bit more shiny you can just add a little bit of water to the pomade, emulsify it into your hands, and then just apply it, and just like that, you're gonna have that shiny look that's so popular right now, and like I said, will be everywhere this year. Now, this next haircut, I don't like it. I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't like it. I think it's a bad haircut. I think it's lazy, it looks like you just woke up, but you know what? It's one of the most popular hairstyles of modern times. I see it everywhere. I'm just aged out of this haircut at this point, I'll be honest, and I look at it, and I just don't understand it, but I'm gonna tell you what it is anyway. It has a lot of names. Some people call it broccoli cut, some people call it the fluffy cut, and it's the TikTok E-boy hairstyle that we see everywhere. It's got this heavy, heavy texture on top, three to five inches of length. It looks like they did nothing to it, but I know damn well that they spent about 30 minutes making sure that their hair looked like they didn't do their hair. Controlled chaos is what I call it. The sides are faded or maybe they're tapered. It adds that contrast of short sides Heavier top with a lot of texture and this is definitely for the Gen Z trendsetters the skaters the gamers The tiktokers right this is the hairstyle. That's dominating online culture right now It's funny because when I started making videos online the hairstyle that was dominating online culture is the quiff Right the quiff was all the buzz and now it's the fluffy broccoli cut. Now the broccoli cut is best for oval, heart, and square face shapes. To style it you can go two different ways. The texture powder is gonna be so easy. Once your hair is dry just literally spritz a little bit of the powder and then scrunch it with your hands. Done. This thing is super powerful by the way, the powder, so just use a little bit of that. The other way you can do it is with a sea salt spray because if you have flat hair you want to add that volume to the texture. So sea salt spray or volume powder, those are both going to achieve that same result. The only difference is that the sea salt spray has a little bit of shine to it and the texture powder is going to give you that matte finish so you can choose how you want your hair to look like. This next hairstyle has been trending for a while and I think it's going to continue to trend in 2025. It's the curly top with a medium or high fade and it's going to continue trend for two reasons. One, if you have really curly hair, this is an easy hairstyle that looks great. And two, if you're just now getting comfortable with showing or maintaining your curls, this is the perfect stepping stone to then have longer hair and go into the hairstyle that I mentioned early, the medium length curls. This is a very easy hairstyle to achieve, three to five inches of natural curls up top paired with a high fade or a medium fade for that sharp contrast that looks so good. It's a perfect hairstyle for confident men who want to embrace their curls. It's also gonna be great if you have really curly hair and it's obviously very very popular on Instagram, YouTube and social media as a whole. To style it, the Argan oil is gonna be your friend because it's going to help you define those curls. And then if you want, you can also add the cream for a light hold if you just scrunch your hair into that texture curl. One of the things that excite me so much about hair is that it can completely change the way that you look. Men's hair, it's like women's makeup. You can really change the way that you look and really elevate yourself by just changing a few things with your hair. So if you want to make a change in 2025, go check out Forte Series dot com and check out the new year, new use sale. The link will be in the description below and let me know which hairstyle you plan on having in 2025."

        "transcript": " Have you noticed how many new fragrances were seen every single day? It literally feels like brands are just shipping them out, just launching new scents faster than ever before. So it can definitely be a little overwhelming and tough to find a new fragrance for you. I own close to 200 fragrances and out of all of them, I chose these eight bottles to talk about today. Now I spent a couple of weeks in Dubai earlier this year and I didn't know this, but the Dubai Mall has the greatest selection of fragrances that I've ever seen. I tried so many fragrances while I was there, but there was one that stood out to me. Hypnotizing fire by the harmonist. And it's not a Dubai brand or anything, it just happened that I found it there. They're from the UK if I'm not mistaken. The first time I sprayed this at the Dubai Mall, it was instant chemistry. This fragrance gives off a warm, almost comforting vibe. It opens up very nicely with spices and then sweet vanilla that rounds it out perfectly. And it's got this rich, sweet, spicy balance that grabs your attention and doesn't let go. I keep, I find myself just smelling when I spray it. It's kind of addicting. It's an addicting set. And these are the notes here if you're interested, if you like knowing that. It also has a slightly metallic undertone. And I mean that in a good way. It's an amazing fall and winter fragrance. You don't see a lot of guys wearing this. One, because it's not a huge like mass appealing designer fragrance, but two, because it's kind of expensive. this 50 ml bottle, 1.7 ounces is $250. But a little goes a long way because the projection strength, the longevity are honestly incredible, pretty incredible. It lasts so long on my skin. I also appreciate the bottle design. It's simple, but it stands out. You know, it's clean. It's got the teardrop shape, right? And the cap has all of these really intricate, really cool details here as well. Overall, really well done by the Harmonyness. I'm gonna link every fragrance, by the way, that I mentioned in the description of this video so you can smell incredible in 2025. Moving on to the next fragrance. To me, this is the most special fragrance on this list. A fragrance that means so much to me and smells like nothing else out there. Forte series antagonist, EDP. This is a smoky, woody fragrance. And what you can smell immediately when you spray it is a strong smoky, patchouli and oud followed by, which makes it interesting, a slight hint of passion fruit that balances this out so perfectly, you can't really tell that it's passion fruit unless you already know. So don't be alarmed, it's not a fruity scent at all. It's a if you know, you know kind of thing. And it's one of those scents that make people lean in and ask what you're wearing. I know that because I get that question all the time when I'm wearing this. If you're a subscriber, you know that I started Forte Series five years ago. And this is a fragrance that we created with a fragrance house that's been in the business for around 200 years. So they make some of your favorite fragrances. They're the real deal. And as you can see by the reviews coming in, I can finally breathe because people are loving both fragrances that we launched. These are the notes for antagonists. This is a mature nighttime scent. It's very strong. It sticks to your skin and your clothes and it projects like crazy. I'm not saying that to hype myself up. I'm saying that because for some people it's too much and that's okay. It's not for them. It's not for the office. It's not for running errands during the day. It's a great fragrance for a date. It's sexy. It's masculine. It comes in this really heavy fluted glass bottle. At first I honestly thought it was a little too heavy, but it looks great. It feels nice. And you can get a 100 ML bottle, which is this bottle right here for $119. Or you can get both Protagonist and Antagonist for $191. So you get a big discount for getting both fragrances. When this next fragrance was announced, I was like, I gotta try it. It's probably gonna be incredible. And I wasn't wrong, man. This is Creed Absolue Aventus. And the original Aventus is so good, right? Part of me was skeptical. I didn't think it could get any better. And I can admit that I was wrong. Creed did it again. They took Aventus, which is considered to be one of the best fragrances of all time, right? By the way, I'll get some pushback on that claim, but fragrances have their cycles. Aquati Joe had its cycle, Blue the Chanel, Aventus. And sure, they might not be the powerhouse fragrances they once were, but they're still incredible sense that dominated that time. and Creed was able to make this amazing scent of Ventus and make it even better, right? Absolute Ventus is richer, it's more intense than the original, it's citrusy, it's got warm spicy notes, it's absolutely beautiful for a night out. I wear this when I'm going out to a classy restaurant, a nice lounge, it's fresh enough that you can wear it during the day if you want and rich enough that you can wear it at night, which is when I personally prefer it when I like it best. During the day, I end up wearing other fragrances, you know, like Hermes H24 or Tom Ford Costa Azura or even the original Aventus, which I still love. To me, this is an incredible night out fragrance. Longevity is decent on my skin. I'd say it's about five hours. It works for all seasons, summer or winter. Doesn't really matter, honestly, it's a hit. The only downside of this fragrance, well, the hefty price tag, you know, $565 for 75 ML. But hey, if you have the money, if you're a fan of Creed and especially a fan of Aventus, this baby is a beauty and a must have. Well, guess what? Absolue Aventus is only the second most expensive fragrance on this list. This next fragrance is called Fragrance Du Bois Oud Blue Intense. This will be my go-to fragrance this summer. It's an amazing hot weather scent. It actually smells like, I imagine, the color blue smells, but with a hint of spicy, woody undertones, hence the name, Intense. It smells like a luxurious, beautiful, sunny day. Looking at the notes, you would think that this smells more like rich amber, woody, spicy, but to me, this is a clean, fresh scent. I don't really even smell the oud in this fragrance, to be honest with you, there may be a little hint of undertone, which is surprising by the name, but it's masculine, it's well-rounded, if you like to smell clean, but you don't wanna smell like the same thing every other guy is wearing. This is a great alternative, but you know what, the reason why other guys aren't wearing this is because it cost $695 for 100 ml. This is the priciest bottle on this list. And yeah, it's a great fragrance. Does it warrant the price? You know, I'd say it's mostly for fragrance collectors or enthusiasts or if you're Paulie and if you don't care that each individual spray costs about $5. There's five, there's 10. I mean, great atomizer too. Let's just, it's really, really powerful. So I was really on the fence about including this next fragrance on the list today. And it's not because I don't think the scent deserves it because it definitely does. It's just because I feel like a broken wreck. I've talked about this fragrance at least a version of this fragrance so many times past four or five years. So I'm sorry to bring it up again, but I couldn't leave it out. Tom Ford, ombre leather, and I like this version even better than the OG. This is less leathery than the original, which is like pure dark leather, but this is crazy strong. It's powerful. It's masculine. It's for the man who wants attention, who commands respect. It's not for a teenager. It's not for a guy who's going out with friends to get ice cream. You know, this is sexy. This is mature. It's dark leather with a hint of sweetness towards the end that balances it out really nicely. If you like strong, heavier scents, this is incredible. You know, a fair warning though, it's not for everyone. It's not a mass appealing scent in my opinion. I find myself wearing this when I'm going out at night to a nice place. for you to wear during the day, I also wouldn't even risk wearing this on a first or even second date because it's polarizing. So there's a chance she might not like this. There's also a chance she might get pregnant. So you know she likes leather, I mean if she likes heavier scents, this is perfect. These are the official notes in ombre leather perfume and the price typically $200 for 50 ml's which is this bottle right here. I had a really hard time deciding between these two fragrances for this list but I made my choice. So we have two. This is from the Mali, Perseus, or Greenlee. And I wore Perseus a lot more over the summer, but I'm actually gonna include Greenlee on this list. And I'm doing that just because it's a little bit more mature to me. It just, I don't know, it spoke to me when I picked it up to choose the fragrances for this list. I'm gonna be wearing this a lot, especially when it gets warm outside in the spring, in the summer. This is for the guy who wants to make sure that he smells great. There's no gamble, there's There's no risk in wearing this fragrance. It's woody, it's citrusy, it's green. The best way to describe it is it's a high quality, clean, green fragrance for the warm seasons. On the website they call it a fresh breath of spring, which honestly I think it's a great description and I got this last summer, the first time I smelled it, it didn't blow me away. It just smelled like a clean summer scent. But then when I sprayed it and when I wore it for the first time, I realized that it smelled way better on my skin. This isn't an innovative scent. It doesn't, you know, hit you in the face with something new. It's not made for that. And once you appreciate that, I think there's something special in that. It's for the guy who wants to wear something that will please anyone and everyone around him. The way I look at it, sometimes you wear fragrances to please other people. Greenlee is a great example of that. It's a scent that everyone likes. Of course you're gonna like it too. But other times, you wear fragrances for yourself. And that's when you go for something more bold, more polarizing, like some of the fragrances that I mentioned earlier. Greenlee goes for $250 for 75 ML and it's just an incredible fragrance. This next bottle, I wore this all fall and I wore it for a while and then I put it away when spring came around. This fall, my girlfriend walks by me one day and I could tell she smelled familiar but I wasn't sure what it was. We played this game, I always try to guess her fragrance and this one stumped me for a minute but I figured it out, she was wearing my fragrance and this is replica Mason Margiela by the fireplace. And I usually, I'm not gonna lie, I just hate when brands tell you that a fragrance is unisex. I don't know, for me, it's either for men or it's for women. Just tell me what it is, because I don't wanna buy a fragrance that ends up being too flowery or too feminine and I can't wear it. But I understand that everything is blended now. I get that. By the fireplace, it smells exactly like it sounds. It's smoky, sweet vanilla, it's got warm spices, and they describe it as burning wood and chestnut. which is a good description. It's the perfect holiday scent because it's comforting, cozy. You wear this on Christmas Day, it's incredible. You go to a cabin, you throw this on, it fits perfectly. But look, it doesn't really pack a punch. It lasts a while on my skin. It doesn't project like crazy. So if you're walking around, the scent doesn't reach too far, but it's good. If someone comes close to you within your space, they're gonna instantly smell it and feel that coziness. And you can get this 100 ml bottle. By the way, this is the limited edition gold bottle. It usually comes in a different kind of bottle, but for $165 you get this bottle, which is well priced for the quality of the set. A fragrance that surprised me, and I didn't think I was gonna like this as much as I do, stronger with you intensely by Emporio Armani. Now, this bottle is simple, it's unassuming, not an expensive scent. It's actually the cheapest one on the list, $110 for this 100 ML bottle. To me, it's vanilla, toffee, and amber, blended up in a bottle. It's definitely sweet. It's definitely sexy. If you like the chocolatey, caramel-y scents, this is beautiful. It has that great projection too, so people can smell you from far. It lasts a while on my skin, so I don't have to keep reapplying. The important notes are on your screen. And one of my favorite things about Stronger With You intensely, you know, it's hard to find fragrances that you can blind buy. So it's really good for a gift, for example. Women tend to like it on men. It's sexy. I've heard some women say that they wear this fragrance because it's sweet and it smells like a sexy dessert, but I do think it's more masculine and leaning than feminine personally. It's the type of fragrance that you can wear on a first date. You should wear it on a first date, actually. You can wear it to a bar, a restaurant, a friend's house. It's not offensive. It's easy to like. This is a banger of a fragrance. These are the fragrances I recommend. You can't go wrong with any of them. They smell absolutely amazing. I'm gonna link all of the fragrances from this list in the description below. Make sure to check that out and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " I'm at the airport right now on the way to Las Vegas for a Formula One. You guys know I'm a huge F1 fan so I'm stoked. But before we get there, I just wanted to catch you up on what's been happening with my life. Usually I don't really gain a lot of weight and lose a lot of weight. I don't do like bulk in season and then cutting season. I don't fluctuate my weight too much. But in the wintertime I do like to gain a little bit of weight like five to ten pounds max. Honestly usually it doesn't really happen because I start to get too bulky and I'm like I don't really like the way I look and I start cutting again. But I'm gonna try this winter. So today's workout is gonna be heavy. Today's workout shoulders traps gonna go nice and slow controlled movements shoulder press to start big heavy long movements and then we're doing flies. From there We're gonna do upright rows. I'm gonna do reverse flies. I feel like my back of my shoulders are underdeveloped So working on those and of course Arnold press one of my favorite exercises for shoulders followed by traps Got to do some shrugs and that will be it the gym fit. We have a represent tank I just got this it's actually first time wearing it feels really nice and light very breathable as RV shorts I really like their military vibes Kid socks and then these A6. Everyone always asks me about these A6. So I'm gonna link everything below for you guys Are you making your famous smoothie? You guys been following me for a while I've been making pretty much the same smoothie with slight variations for I don't even know man. It's probably been like 10 years. It's been a while But I just generally like this smoothie. I'm addicted to smoothies. I'm not gonna lie I'm just gonna put it out there. I love protein shakes And I have this protein shake every day. And then I do, I don't have one in here, but I'll do like one of these every day too. And then at night, depending on how I feel with my protein intake, I'll have another one. So I really try to get my protein take up these days, especially because honestly, I haven't been eating that well. So I'm trying to supplement it as much as possible. Tell us the ingredients then. All right. Y'all like to know. Good old, optimum nutrition. Gotta go with the vanilla ice cream just because it's not too strong of a taste. If you do chocolate, sometimes it can be a little overwhelming. So the two scoops of that, that, the two scoops are 48 grams of protein. So, I mean, that's pretty legit. And then, I didn't really tell you guys this, But I went to Brian Johnson's house when I was in LA and I had dinner with him and he talked to me about blueprint and he talked to me about his project, don't die and brilliant guy by the way. So I've been doing a scoop of his protein as well. So this one only has 13 grams of protein but it has other vitamins and whatnot and this is also plant protein. Little squeeze of this AG1 vitamin. I do about seven grams of creatine. Strawberries. Some blueberries. Some chia seeds. Blend it up. I mean, I just got this blender, this beast blender, and I like it because these containers, they have basically like the little straw hole right there. So, boom, actually looks really nice. 10 out of 10, every time. Hello everyone. How are you all doing today? Guys, great to see everyone. I love seeing the cameras turning on right now. Good morning, good evening, afternoon. I know there's people from all over the world right now in different time zones. I appreciate you being here today. Hopefully you guys can hear me okay. If you can, just give me a quick thumbs up. If you can hear me, if you can see me, if it's all good. All right, all right, awesome, awesome, perfect. but I do like to start for sure in December. And the reason for that is simply because I don't like the new year, new me mindset of, now that it's a new year, now things are gonna change. All of a sudden, after December 31st, January 1st, that's the day that it's all gonna start. By the way, I think it's a continuous mindset. I think it's a continuous growth that you need in order to achieve the success that you want. And I'm not saying you have to drop everything and start working on your goals for next year, but if your goal next year is to be in shape, then why wait until January 1st? You can start going to the gym, even if it's a couple of days a week right away, right now, and just working that muscle, right? Whether it's investing a little bit of your cash at the end of the month, right? Or the beginning of the month, even better, or going to the gym a couple of times a week or trying out new outfits or reaching out to that person. haven't talked to in a while, whatever your goal is for next year, there's really no reason to wait and then go all out on January 1st. I think a lot of people make that mistake. Personally, I don't like that. So when I say massive success, that's what I mean. It's being successful in all areas of your life. It's not just financial success. A lot of YouTubers are all about money, money, money, money. If you watch my content, you know that's not me. I'm way more about joy, happiness, fulfillment, purpose, having the right mindset. I think to me that's way better. My goal is never to make a billion dollars. My goal is to be happy. Okay, that went really well. So every month we do a live call with this community that I built called Men's in Wichita Lab. It's a free community, so if you wanna join, you can join. There's 4,500 members, there are 27 members online right now. And it's always good because we're just basically helping guys elevate themselves. And I love creating these videos here for you guys on YouTube, we're on social media and channel, Instagram, TikTok, but it's a lot of output, not a lot of input. I get some comments, of course, feedback, but it's minimal. And on these calls, I actually get to talk to my community, talk to you guys. And I think that's really special. It's something that I hadn't really done in a long time until I built this community, and it's absolutely free. So if you wanna join, check it out. Getting cold in New York. So I figured I'd buy some sweaters because honestly I'm lacking on the sweater department. I went to Simon's online, had never bought anything from them before and I just got a ton of knitwear, different sweaters. This one's kind of long on me. Which you know, five, nine problems always. Rodrigo, Rodrigo knows. Facts. But if you kind of roll it, tuck it under like this, obviously you'll get it tailored. It looks pretty good. I like the detail. We'll see. I'm not sure about this one. I really like the texture on the sweater. This looks so cool. Check it out. It's a simple sweater, but the texture just makes it look really nice. Makes it pop a little bit more. And this one fits me better, which is nice. Not as thick too. I get really warm if I'm wearing a thick sweater. This one's a keep, I think. What do you think? Keep. Yeah, this one's nice, I like it. And it's nice and soft too. This one is a cable knit sweater, which I don't have any right now, which is crazy. Again, plain with the textures. This is from a different brand. This is from Outer Known, size medium, as you can see. And it fits me really well. Actually, I really like this one. This one's my favorite so far. This is a quarter zip that I just got. And again, the cable knit texture looks really nice, cozy. I mean, this is so easy to mix and match. You can literally wear this with anything. So I highly recommend getting a cable knit quarter zip sweater, because as you can see, it looks pretty good. And last but not least, this is a heavier sweater for sure, but it's a little box here. You can see the shoulder seam is a little more dropped. It's a little lower, as opposed to having the shoulder seam here where it's supposed to go. This gives it a more laid back, casual, relaxed style. Again, with the texture, the sweaters are all about texture this season and it just feels really cozy. So I'll link everything below. It's not sponsored. I just really like the stuff I bought it myself. If you guys wanna check it out, I'll link everything below. Give it one more time, make it a little tighter. One thing I always advocate for is financial education. And I know there's a lot of information out there and it can be overwhelming, But don't let that get in the way of you reaching your financial freedom. Is that it? That's it. Well, we're going to do three frames. So this is just the first one. Oh, OK. When you become a member, you get access to real human advisors and not algorithms all at a fraction of the traditional cost, plus higher yields than your traditional high yield savings account. All right. So wrap. Done. I don't think I had much, but I did not I'm looking at in your email for some invites and for like some real estate stuff in there I also believe your calendar to include your flight for last Vegas this Thursday. Yeah I assume that's the final one because that's the last of the three I set my net like that's final final part Okay, sounds good. Yeah, I put it in the calendar too. All right perfect. Yeah, I know everything looks good then feedback is positive. You can say hi to the vlog. You're on the vlog. Hello everyone. Alright, awesome man. Thank you so much. I'll see you tomorrow. What's up? What's up brother? How you doing? What's going on? Hey shooty. Just calling to see if you're all set for tomorrow. For your trip. Yeah, bro. I'm just starting packing. I'm not sure about the weather down there or how's that? This is my brother, William. He's in Florida. He's coming to visit me tomorrow. Alright, bro. You're gonna be truffle tomorrow. Yeah, you're gonna be truffle tomorrow. Yeah, get ready. He's chilling right now. But he wasn't earlier. He was a little menace today. Alright, bro, sounds good. Let me know if you need anything. And I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. Love you. See you tomorrow. Bye. So my brother's coming tomorrow because Truffle's not fully vaccinated yet, and we're going to Vegas, me and Emily. And I didn't wanna just leave him with anyone and he can't go to a doggie hotel yet cause he's not fully vaccinated, so I just didn't feel comfortable doing that. It's a much better alternative than putting him in a doggie hotel or something like that. So that should be fun. Oh wow, wow, who's that? Doorbell ringing? Sup bro? Sup brother. How's it going? Welcome, welcome. Thank you. It's a big truck. Truffle! Oh my... This is your uncle William. He's a grown boy. Hey, fluffy. Oh my god, it's beautiful. This is your uncle. Hey! My dream is your uncle. This is like your real real uncle. He's got a lot of uncle in the house. He's got such funny colors. He's biting my back. Yeah. He's a biter. He's a biter. He's teething right now. His teeth are about to start falling out. It's so sharp. Yeah, they're about to start falling out. Really sharp right now. I just felt it. Yeah, no, I have cuts on my fingers. The good thing is he's really food-driven. So when we do sit, this is the hand signal. And then lay down, this is the hand signal. Your gut stays like this. Sit. Good boy, good boy, good boy. And then tell him to lay. Lay. Gotcha. Lay, lay, lay, lay, lay. Good boy, good boy. And then he doesn't say yes, and give him a treat. Yes, give him a treat. There we go. He scrubs. Good boy. He's so happy to see him. I know. What is under there? Food, bro. Look at this. Look at the way he's just stretching in there. All right, going down. Going down. Truffle. Yeah, I think I'm going to try. Come on. You trust me, huh? You trust me with your life. Always looking for food. Because that ball, we feed him with that ball feeder. And he has to hit it. and the ball of the food goes everywhere, you know? And it's like, so he works his mind and is physical too, but it just kind of scatters so that he can just be like, he can smell it under the desk or whatever and he'll be like trying to claw onto it. All right, so I got some good news from the agency because we're supposed to do the, we're launching the Chrome Clay and we've been playing with this at the mood board in our shop, this is what we thought yesterday. And then he came back to me and really talked about this. The price was kind of hefty, kind of out of our budget. So he sent me a mo-backer and I was like, really excited about this project because it would be great for our portfolio. It is a good idea. Yeah, like the whole display box thing. It's gonna be like, yeah. To make it work, he's like, I'll lower my feet, cover something that'll cost myself. I also asked my team to help by taking on most of the tasks, like lighting, styling, finding clothes, building props, like box. But my team would love to get some extra for today products as extra. Haha. So we're gonna pick, we'll pick the good products. All right. That's when you know the product is good. You're like, no, we just want more products. Yeah. All right. Yeah, let me talk to Paula and Brian, make sure that we're good with that budget. But I think so, I mean that sounds like a pretty good deal. Yeah, you know, and it's gonna be. That's like half. It's gonna be a cool shoot. He cut out half. He literally cut it by 50%. Yeah, which I was like surprised. And I thought you'd maybe take off maybe 25% of it. Yeah, we're shooting a reel about the best men's fragrances for winter. And typically this is my guest bathroom. Typically we have the medicine cabinet here, but I had my system moved everything from my Frigates collection, or at least a lot of it, and put it here so we can shoot this video. One of the most important things when it comes to shooting videos, reels, TikTok specifically, are the first two seconds, even first second of the video. And I just think opening this cabinet, the first scene would be basically me opening this cabinet and revealing the collection. and that just creates a little bit of that like intrigue. Why does this guy have so many fragrances? I got a lot of comments like, why do you keep it in your bathroom? You shouldn't do that, you know? In a way, you're kind of like fishing for comments. There you go, insider secret. I don't keep my fragrances here. Look at that. Why are you shooting it? Well, obviously, you know, I do this every season. I think it's, I'm a huge fragrance nerd, so I really like changing my fragrances for every season. And of course, the season is extra special because I just launched a really great fall, winter fragrance, nighttime fragrance, antagonist. And it was a great way to promote the fragrance. But also, I'm not the kind of guy who's only gonna promote that one fragrance. I'm also gonna promote these other fragrances that I absolutely love, the Harmonist Hypnotizing Fire Centaurus by Creed, which is their latest release, really, really good. One of my all-time favorites, Tom Ford Elbury Leather and Replica by the Fireplace. This one is really good for fall too. little sneak peek on one of the intros. Yeah where's it at? There we go. We shot a few different ones. I don't like this one as much because you can't really see the fragrance. I like the first one the best. Yeah. Yeah this one. By the way what should we call this vlog? Yeah that's a real question. We're stuck. We gotta call it something. Yeah. Can't call it a And please don't say diaries because 20 other creators got like diaries And it can't be vlog because it's too generous to do now. I don't even like the word vlog to like 2010 But let me know guys what should I call it? I honestly have no idea and you guys always come up with really good ideas So if you could help me come up with a name for the series so that every time I drop it on YouTube I name it that and you know it's a vlog because obviously we still have the other videos coming live here on YouTube If you have any suggestions, I'm all yours. The fire from here. That's That's crazy. The fire is crazy. That looks bad. That smoke is thick. Yeah, I was like I've literally finished shooting The the fragrance collection and then I look outside because the door was open and I was just like I Look outside. I just see black smoke. It's funny cuz Because we've seen a lot of smoke from fires and stuff, but I've never seen the flames from here. Yeah, the flames are crazy. That's...it looks bad. And it's...in New York, being a firefighter in New York, man, props to those guys because that's **** tough. Can you imagine having to fix that? Like, how do you even do it? I'm just saying, how are you going to get through? You gotta go all the way...it's literally on the rooftop. You gotta go all the way up there. Oh, okay. You know, it's so dangerous. There's other buildings next to it. There's people crossing the street. It's just, it's crazy. Their job is just tough, man. Good on them. It's a tough job. That's what I wanted to do when I was, remember? That's true. I might've didn't do that. Packin' for Vegas. This is not my usual packing job. Usually what I'll do is, especially if it's, you know, somewhere cool, somewhere where I'm doing content there, I'll write a note with all of my outfits for every single day, like morning, afternoon, evening. I'm not doing that. I'm throwing everything into the suitcase. Vegas is one of those weird ones too, because it's like all indoors, but it's really cold outside. So I don't know. Is it cold outside? I thought it was. Yeah, it's gonna be cold. Oh, like it's cold? Yeah. Yeah. Vegas gets cold. It's like the desert gets really cold. When it's cold, then it gets really hot when it's hot. Both extremes. You got jackets? That's gonna be cold. I'm bringing jackets, I'm bringing some fragrances for some friends, you know? Got a gift for people that you love. I'm bringing these guys. I don't really wear these a lot. As you can see, it's about time. You don't know anything about Rodrigo yet. Rodrigo's actually very into fashion too. So sometimes we'll come into here, or I won't even come, I'm like, Rodrigo, can you put some outfits together for me? And he'll figure it out. So he doubles, you know, he's a videographer, fashion advisor, editor. All of it. I know this closet, like the back of my hand. Whenever you get something new, I'm like, yo, did you just get that? Yeah, is that new? Oh my God, I just got it yesterday. I knew. He's got an inventory of all my pieces. I've worn this one a couple times. Yeah, I can't believe that. We can't believe those memories of Mad Jack hit. Yeah. It weren't too good. I don't think you remember it. Anyway. You're a little gone. The gray pants, white shoes, and then you. Oh, okay. All right. All right. No, drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. Boy. We just got into Vegas. Vegas here for Formula One. If you don't know I'm a huge Formula One fan. I've been to four races so far. I've been to Mexico City, Monaco, Spy and Belgium and I've also been to Austin. So this is my fifth race, fifth different place and of course Vegas is a whole spectacle. So I'm really really excited. I have a lot of friends year too. It was a five hour flight to get here from New York City so I'm tired, I'm hungry, we just got some in-room dining so we're gonna enjoy that, take a shower, I got some work to do. Get ready and go. We're literally booked and busy the entire week and we have so much going on between concerts and dinners and workouts already booked so there's a lot going on and I'm gonna take you along for the ride. They left us these beautiful little truffles. We're only checked into the hotel, which reminds us we should face time truffle. Let's do it. Nicole, William, make sure the truffle is okay. So, bro, how's it going? Good. I'm here. There he is. There he is. How's he been? He was just by the door. I was thinking about walking him. I was scared, but obviously I was thinking about it. Has he been okay? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you know, needy. Yeah. Sweet. Do you think he knows that we're gone? I think so. I mean, he's been crying by the door a bit a couple times. Okay, yeah. He's never done that. That's so sad. He's never done that before. You know he's never done that. I went into record. I wasn't sure if he wanted to go out. That's why I'm taking him out because he was crying by the door. And I was like, oh. By which door? Like, literally. The front door? Like, come over here. And he's over there. Oh! Oh! We've never seen him do that. It's okay, buddy. We're gonna be back soon, man. You're gonna have so much fun with Shutey tomorrow. You're gonna be just fine. It's just tonight. It's just tonight he might be sad. Yeah. Tomorrow he'll be like, literally forget about us. Once another dog's there, he'll be fine. What was that? A present. Okay. Mr. Alex Costa. Wow, look at that. I know. I wonder what it is. Let me see the note. What is it? Let me see the note. Now this cost, okay. What do you think it is? I have no idea. Is it a jacket? Oh! Ooh! That's not what I was expecting at all. What were you expecting? Oh, that's kind of sick. Nice! Not gonna lie, that's kind of sick. Wow, all right. I like it. Formula one Las Vegas looks good. You look so official even with the with your lanyard Do I look official like I look cool or do I look official like I work at Formula one? You look like you worked there. Like I'm like ushering people in But I'm just like Well-ish dressed Is that what's happening? It's a little much with the lanyard. I don't know. It's a cool jacket. It's just not for this outfit that I'm Maybe another day. Another day. But wait, there's more. It feels like a weapon. What do you think it is? A candle? Umbrella? Oh. What is that? Is it a bottle? It's a Belvedere bottle. It's vodka. Oh! Perfect. This is a really nice bottle of vodka. This is the coolest bottle of vodka I've ever seen. It's a beautiful gift from Formula One. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. here. Headed out for the night styling my hair with the Forte series hair styling cream. It's been my go-to for this kind of like flowy hairstyle that's not too proper. I mean I just kind of like to scrunch it up a little bit give it some give it some life you know so it's not too stiff but the size I like to just kind of palm them down and take that volume away so that they're more slicked on the side here. I think we're, I think we're good. This is what it looks like. The hairstyling cream is perfect for this type of hairstyle. We have Hakasan with Patron. Fisher is playing there. He's a DJ that Emily really likes. I really like him as well. And then we have chain smokers that I excess with my friends who are visiting from London and Monaco. And then we have a Paris Hilton private party there's just a lot going on so I'm honestly not even sure where we're going but take you guys along. Hi May. Hi Alex. That's me good. Vegas is good. We had a nice day today we woke up early got like healthy breakfast went to a workout that Barry's workout they saw in the emails. Yeah, I saw that one. And then now we have a concert at 5.45, so in three hours? I checked in with Paula and she said that she's been using ClickUp this week and she said, just be a little patient with the team. Everybody is in there, but she said, you know, be a little more patient with the entire team. So yeah. Yeah, right. This is a big move. And obviously when you change software for the entire company, it's, you know, it's There's gonna be some hiccups, there's gonna be some adjusting. And yeah, I think it's okay to just be flexible, just be patient with the team. And it's gonna, the same is gonna happen when we, bless you, when we switch over the media team as well. Yep. Right, it's gonna be a little bit difficult. I mean, even for me, I'm still, I'm still getting lost within ClickUp all the time. I'm gonna have to do a crash course next week. It's race day. It's also our last full day in Vegas. So we're gonna have some food right now, I have dinner and then head over to the race. I'm excited, qualifying yesterday was really, really fun. And also crazy results, I wasn't really expecting the results if you're a Formula One fans than you already saw, but you know, Gazzly being up there, just saying for stopping in Norris, being all the way down fifth and sixth was pretty crazy. So I'm excited to see what happens today. It sounds like the Mercedes have a pretty good shot as well. And not only that, but also we get to leave tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. and go back to Truffle. So we're gonna eat this right now and head over to the track. So we got some fried rice, Kung Pao chicken, some more rice, and then, Emily's favorite. All right. Everyone's so excited for this race. I can feel it, feel it in my bones. I don't know, I have a feeling Max is gonna win the championship. I'm not a Max fan, I'm not gonna lie. I'm a Lewis fan, but you know what? Max has been good. Let's see what happens. Emily stole my jacket for today. Looking good. I like it. Look at the fit. Woo! What about our drinks? Fruits and martinis. We love the Fruits and martinis with chiquilla. Hot tape. Tastes good. How is it? It tastes good. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. It's a little funky. Hi baby! Hi baby! Hi baby! Hi! Hi! Hi! I know who you are! You're the biggest fuck in the world! I miss you so much!"

        "transcript": " Let me take you back to 2014 for a second. I was 25 years old and I got laid off from my dream job at the time, hosting a show about video games. I went from the peak of my life to the scariest place that I'd ever been. Unemployed, broke, confused, and honestly, not proud of the man that I was becoming. And I thought at 25 I'd have it all figured out. And it turned out that I was really wrong. Well, by my 30th birthday, I became a millionaire. And fast forward to today, I'm living the life that I've always dreamed of. I run multiple highly profitable businesses while traveling the world, staying in great shape. And I have the freedom that I always wanted so badly. And at the end of every year, I like to sit down and think about what my year was like. And I realized 2024 was the 10 year anniversary of that terrible year, 2014. The year I got laid off, the year I felt lost and embarrassed. So this video is about that journey. I wanted to break it down into the most actionable information possible. So I'm not just giving you some AI generated script about self-development, like all these other guys on social media nowadays who act like they've done it really, but all they do is talk. I've lived it, I've earned this life. And now I wanna share this knowledge with you because I don't want you to be in the same place that I was in 10 years ago, or maybe you're already there right now. I condensed this down to seven habits. Seven habits that I built one by one, habits that turn my life around before I even hit 30. And I still use them every single day. And at the end of this video, I'm going to share one habit, the one non-negotiable habit that unlocked my full potential. When my family moved from Brazil to the US, I was 13 years old, right? At 14, I got my first job at Domino's Pizza. And I started to learn about money management, saving, spending my own money, helping my parents. There were small lessons, but lessons that are essential for anyone who wants to be successful. But making $7 an hour at Domino's Pizza is very different from making six or seven figures a year. Once my income went up, I panicked. I didn't know what to do with that money and because I had never made real money before and neither did my family, this was my shot, my one shot at financial freedom and I didn't wanna f*** it up. So I started consuming as much content as I possibly could about finances. As soon as I started making six figures a year, which to me, by the way, it was a dream come true at the time, right? I was eating audiobooks for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My mom gave me the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad when I was in my early 20s And I read it, but I had no money then, so it didn't really click back at the time. So I decided to go back to that book and start there. And then I listened to other books by the same author, Robert Kiyosaki. And man, I was hooked. I listened to Money, Master of Game by Tony Robbins, The Four-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. I got into self-development books, like The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday, Who Not How by Dan Sullivan, 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson, and a ton of other books that would help me become, not just better with my finances, but truly become a better man. I was just so happy to have access to these incredibly smart people who were showing me the way through their books. And it was like having a cheat code. I would listen while I was driving at the gym, or I'd go for a walk and listen to those audiobooks. And then here's the best part. Nowadays, you have a million more resources than I did when I started. This is the podcast era. You can listen to billionaires who share their knowledge in the All In podcast. You have my first million, the Tim Ferriss show, the Ramsay show. And like I said, I want you to buy the end of this video to know exactly what you have to do. And the first step that I want you to take starting today is this, replace one hour of entertainment every single day with one hour of educational content. And you're going to start with topics that interest you specifically. So finances, fitness, business, relationships, whatever you're into. And I've given you a bunch of recommendations already, but I'm going to list even more for you in the description of this video. So check them out at the end because there was one more added benefit to going through all of this educational content that I didn't realize at the time, but it was life changing on its own. I mentioned earlier on that my family immigrated from Brazil to the US when I was 13. So my native language is actually Portuguese. And I speak Portuguese with my family, with my friends in Brazil. I had to work really hard to learn English to lose my heavy accent. And he made me realize there's a correlation between how well you communicate and how well you do in life. And it's not black and white. Of course you see exceptions like Elon Musk, for example, who is known for not being the best at communicating, right? When he's speaking in front of a crowd, but typically if you're well spoken, if you can express your thoughts properly, if you're eloquent, you're going to do better in life. And when I was younger, I underestimated the power of communication. I thought being a nice guy was enough, but I realized this, your ability to communicate determines how far you're going to go, whether it's in relationships, business or life in general. And that's because communication isn't just about talking. It's about connecting. The better you communicate, the better your life will be. In those audiobooks, they really helped my vocabulary. So I was double dipping. I was learning about the topics inside the audiobooks, and I was learning how to express myself with confidence. But there was one thing I did, again, unintentionally, that massively helped my English and my communication skills. And you're looking at it right now. When I started posting YouTube videos, they were all in Portuguese. Once I switched over to English, it was kind of like trial by fire. it made me realize that my English needed some serious work. I had to reshoot things over and over again because of my accent, because I didn't have the right words to express my thoughts and I didn't have the confidence in myself. And now, thousands of videos later, put me in front of a million people, give me the microphone and I'll figure it out. You know, I might get the butterflies and the mic might be a little shaky at first, but then I know that I can do it because I've practiced right here, over and over and over again. So here's your next step To become a better communicator, you're gonna do this by practicing active listening. That's number one, truly listening. Instead of just zoning out and waiting to respond to someone, pay attention to what they're saying. When you're speaking, slow it down. People might think that good communicators are the ones who speak really fast, but that's not true. Take your time, maintain eye contact while you do it. And the best thing that you can do is grab your phone and record yourself speaking, whether it's in a meeting, practicing a pitch, or even just talking about your day. You're probably going to hate the way that you sound or the way that you look or move, but it doesn't matter because that's the point. You're going to see a lot of things that need improvement, which means now you know exactly what you have to work on. Are you able to maintain eye contact with your phone camera? Because if you can't even do it with your phone, it's going to be really hard to do it when you're talking to an actual person. Do you look uncomfortable? Are you moving your hands around too much? These are all things that you can notice and improve upon immediately. Because the thing is a lot of people nowadays are stuck in this virtual world, right? And not in the real world. And what ends up happening is they consume all day, but they never actually talk or express themselves. And I know expressing yourself isn't easy, but we all have something unique, something personal that we can share with the world. You just have to know yourself well enough to know what is this thing that I can share with the world. What can the world learn from me? Who are you? What are your values? And a good way to find out is to talk to a professional, someone who understands people, who can help you organize your head, your thoughts, The same way that you organize your computer hard drive or your desktop folder, our sponsor BetterHelp can connect you to a professional so you can organize your mind and help you answer any questions about yourself. They offer therapists specialized in any area that you need help with. You should look at therapy like a coaching session, like you're learning about yourself, why you act a certain way, why you get mad in certain situations, why you're socially shy or anxious, why you have a hard time asking for help or communicating with your girlfriend. That's why therapy is so good. It gives people a safe space to talk about these things that, let's be honest, men don't really share. It's not something that we tend to talk about, not even with our closest friends. You sign up online, they match you with the therapist according to your needs, and then you can schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that, so you don't have to go in person. It's obviously discreet and it's on your schedule. Your therapist is just another person who is on your side, your team, helping you become a better man. about it that way makes it a lot easier to understand why therapy is a net positive. And again, you can always stop if you don't like it, you can swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which better help offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason.

Oh, and something else that happened in this new digital era that we're living in, people forgot how to dress right in 2020 we went from dressing up, going out into the world, going into the office to dressing down in sweatpants and hoodies and baggy clothing. And even hairstyles went from sharp and professional to looking messy on purpose. The fluffy hairstyle is the actual name of this hairstyle. Back in the day, I used to also think that fashion didn't matter, that dressing well was superficial, but I was obviously wrong. Here's what I learned. Your style is your silent introduction, right? It's the first thing that people notice about you. Whether you like it or not, you don't really have a choice. Humans are gonna judge you by your looks in a split second, the moment they lay eyes on you. When I started dressing well, something changed. It wasn't just about impressing other people, that's great and all, but that was just a bonus. Dressing well gave me confidence and I felt that confidence in every aspect of my life. When you look good, you feel good, it's that simple. It's the backbone of my entire YouTube channel and my online content. Dressing well earned me respect. People started taking me more seriously, both professionally and socially. That's why it's so important. That's why I talk about it so much here. A lesson I want you to take from this is that your appearance isn't about vanity, it's about self-respect and projecting the best version of yourself to the world. And that's why step three is to take the next 30 days to improve the way that you look. Watch some of my fashion videos or honestly anyone else who you relate to their style. Change up your haircut. Make sure that you feel good about the way that you look. Now, let's talk about practicality. How can you start dressing better without feeling overwhelmed, right? First, focus on the basics. I recommend building a wardrobe of timeless essentials. Polos, trousers, high quality jackets, nice footwear like loafers or sneakers. Avoid trendy items that are gonna feel outdated in six months. And instead, investing high quality pieces that look sharp that stand a test of time. And if you're not sure where to start, I got a ton of fashion videos on this channel to break it down for you. Second, don't underestimate the power of grooming. A great haircut, nice facial hair, and clean, healthy skin, that's gonna elevate any outfit. Just think of your grooming routine as you're finishing touch right to your look. It's what makes everything come together. And if you wanna take it up a notch, make sure that you're wearing an amazing fragrance like the fourth day series protagonist. Smelling great is just as important as looking great. Now, make sure that you're not just blowing all your money on clothes. All right, especially trendy clothes. Blowing money on things that you don't need is a horrible habit and you have to learn to control the urge as much as possible. Because otherwise what's gonna happen is you're gonna dig a hole that you can't get out of. If you can't control your money, you can't control your life. I thankfully learned this lesson really early in my life because I was poor. So any money that I had was really important to me. I would save it. I'd be really careful with it. It was so, so important to me. Because if I wanted to buy a hoodie that cost me 50 bucks, I would have to work eight hours to afford it. So having those low paying, $%&% jobs early on in my life, they taught me a lot about money. They taught me the value of money. It taught me to appreciate the very little money that I made and it made me stop and think about my spending habits. I started tracking my money when I was 14 years old, right? How much I was getting paid, my expenses, my savings. I would sit and plan out how long it would take me to buy my first car. Then I would budget, put money into a car fund. And in two years, when I turned 16 years old, I was finally able to achieve my dream and buy my first car. A green 1995 VW Jetta. Standard transmission, of course, it cost me $2,000 and I felt on top of the world driving that car. All the budgeting, the saving, the tracking my finances finally paid off. So if you ever wanna be successful in this world that we live in, you have to understand how money works. You need to track your income, your expenses. You need to save and invest. Track every dollar that you spend. And it's really not that hard because apps like Monarch and Mint make it super easy. I didn't have these resources back in the day, so I did it manually. Now everything is automated for you, it's easy. So your next step is to set clear financial goals. And it could be to pay off your debts, to save a specific amount, to buy a property. And once you have that goal in front of you, you have to make a realistic plan to achieve it, right? So write down how much of your income is actually going towards that goal every month. Write down how long it will take you once you start. And stick to it, don't budge once because then you're gonna budge again. stay true to your words. Stick to your plan no matter what. It's really important that once you tell yourself that you're doing something, that you do it. And a good way to hold yourself accountable is to share your plan with someone else. A friend, a family member, or whoever, so they can help you stay accountable. And that works for your financial plan, but it's also amazing if one of your goals is to be in great shape. When I started working out, I was 16 years old. It was actually the first thing that I did when I got my Jetta. I drove to the gym and I signed up, Planet Fitness, 20 bucks a month at a time, because I had my freedom. You know, I could finally do whatever I wanted. I had a car. And so every day after school, I'd go to the gym and I was really consistent. But the secret wasn't the car. It was my best friend, Chris. Chris and I would go to the gym every day together. We held each other accountable. No matter what, we were at the gym right after school and that taught me a big lesson about working out consistently. And I can't emphasize this enough. Working out is about so much more than just looking good. It's about discipline, mental clarity. It's about building confidence. At that time, I made fitness non-negotiable. And to this day, I show up to the gym, whether I feel like it or not. Why? Because consistency in the gym, it spills over to every aspect of my life. The gym taught me consistency and accountability. And all of that led to my growth. Sure, I like being fit, I like looking good, being healthy, having energy, but to me, going to the gym is a non-negotiable. I work out five to six days a week, no matter what, and I've been doing that since I was 16. I wanted to be really big at one point, then I wanted to be really lean. It didn't really matter. The goal was always to show up. That was it. So this next step for you is to get into a consistent workout routine. To prove it to yourself that you can't, that you're strong enough, and that you have the discipline to do something for yourself every single day. Just start with a schedule that you can stick to. Could be three days a week, four days a week, that's enough. When you see that physical progress, then you start to believe that you can make progress anywhere else in your life. And if you wanna maximize that physical progress, You can't just work out, right? You need to make sure that you also have a good diet. When I was in my 20s, I was living in LA and I was eating whatever cheap meal I could because I was broke, right? So frozen pasta from Trader Joe's, fast food, ramen noodles, I did what I had to do. And if you follow me for a while, you know that cooking was never really my strength. It was a running joke here on the channel for a long time. I just don't enjoy cooking. So one of the first things I did when I started making good money was figure out how to eat well, eat clean, but eat efficiently. I didn't want to waste a lot of time cooking and meal prepping if I didn't have to. So I asked a few personal trainers at my gym, what was the best and most efficient way to have a good diet without wasting time? And I was willing to spend a little more to get my time back as long as the food was good. One trainer recommended that I reach out to this girl in LA who meal prepped every week and then she delivered those meals and they cost $15 per meal. I decided to give that a try and it was life changing for me. I was eating healthy every day without having to think about it, without having to sacrifice my time. That time that I would have spent meal prepping or cooking every single day went into my work, my career. And fast forward to today, I'm still doing the same thing. I ordered from a place here in New York City. It's called Territory. This is in sponsored, but I do really like their food. I can link it below if you're interested. And if it's too expensive for you, I totally get it. So here's your next step, the next habit that I want you to form. What is the best way for you to eat a healthy diet? Make it as easy as possible. Maybe it's meal prepping on Sunday, right? And then you just eat it throughout the week. Or maybe you find a meal delivery place near your house, get creative with it so that you can be consistent with your diet. That lesson of ordering prepped meals was a big one for me because it reminded me of how important time is always going to be for me. I value my time the most out of anything in my life. So it's no surprise that this next habit is incredibly important. It changed my life forever. Time will always be your most valuable resource. The one thing that you can never get back. You always hear that, right? and it's absolutely true. And I realized that early on, and I decided to become great at time management. When I was working at Google from 2015 to 2018, I learned all about their products, search, Gmail, Nest, and there were two that really stood out to me. One was of course, YouTube. To me, the greatest media platform in the world. But the other might be a surprise to you, Google Calendar. I became a master at managing my Google Calendar. And I'm so thankful that I had that experience because he changed everything for me. I mean, remember, at that time I was juggling a full-time job at Google, which was not easy. I was dealing with really smart people and I had to show up. I was building this YouTube channel. I was posting every single day on Instagram. I was going to the gym every day, five to six days a week at least, and I still had my personal life. I didn't have a choice but to master time management. And I used Google Calendar religiously, scheduled every minute of my day, and I prioritize any task that pushed me closer to my goals. Fast forward to today, I still live by my calendar, but I've gotten even better at managing it because I had to. I have a lot of employees, I'm running multiple businesses, still running this YouTube channel, still posting on Instagram even more now, so there's no other way to do this besides being extremely organized with my calendar. So here's your final action step, learn to use Google Calendar and use time blocking. Plan your day in chunks. work, gym, learning, downtime, your social things, put it all into Google Calendar and set deadlines because this is what I learned. Your work hours actually tend to expand to fit the time that you give it. So shorten your timeline and then watch how much faster you get things done. Trust me, when you manage your time well, you get more done in one day than most people do in one week. And remember this, you don't need to tackle all of these habits at once. Start with one, master it, then move on to the next. Let's make this year your year you got this."

        "transcript": " 2024 probably didn't turn out the way that you hoped. Maybe you had setbacks, failures, moments when you felt completely stuck, and that's okay. Every great comeback starts with a fall. Let's be honest, life doesn't always go as planned. There's no success without hardship. That's why every hero goes through tough times. The very best athletes, champions, and leaders in history have all gone through moments when the odds were stacked against them. Think about Michael Jordan. He was cut from his high school basketball team or JK Rowling. She was rejected by 12 publishers before Harry Potter became a global phenomenon. Now their greatness wasn't handed to them. They earned it through resilience. They could have just quit but they kept going because that was their goal. The truth is that your setback is actually just a setup for your comeback and in 2025 this is going to be your year. This is going to be the year that you finally make that comeback and today I'm not here to motivate you. I'm here to give you the exact strategies to take this year to the next level to transform your life. And let's actually start with a question. A simple question that most people think they can answer, but they can't. What does success mean to you? Because of social media especially, most people chase someone else's version of success. Luxury cars, designer clothes, a house on the water. But here's the problem. If you're chasing a life that doesn't align with your own values, you're gonna feel empty when you get there. Those weren't even your personal goals to begin with. So take a moment to think about what really matters to you. Maybe it's financial freedom. Maybe it's getting married to the woman of your dreams. Maybe it's having freedom to do whatever you want, location freedom to live wherever you want, whatever it is, define it, define the version of success that matters the most to you. Here's how I like to do it. So when I worked at Google, we had these stretch goals, which were basically goals that were very meaningful that guide my life. And when you're writing these stretch goals, they might seem really far off right now. They're supposed to, right? That's okay. That's actually the correct way of doing it. The important thing is that you should know that you're working towards that direction. You should know the direction that you're going into. And once you define those goals, every decision you make, big or small, should technically move you closer to those goals. Now that's the easy part. Here comes the second part and the hard part. If you're serious about achieving these goals, if you're really serious, now you have to ask yourself, what kind of pain do I want? I know that sounds odd, but this is the strategy from author Mark Manson who realize that having a goal is the easy part, right? Obviously most people wanna be financially free. Obviously most people wanna travel the world, be in great shape, no doubt. The real challenge comes from being willing to accept the sacrifices needed to achieve those goals. Think about that. Do you want the challenges, the early mornings, the late nights, the sacrifices that come before all of the exciting, the glamorous outcome? Mark realized that it's really easy to sit around and think about what we want, what we wish for, right? It's fun, but it's a completely different thing to accept the trade-offs and the sacrifices that come with our goals. Goal setting isn't just about choosing the rewards that you wanna enjoy, but also the costs that you're willing to pay. And that, my friends, that's the hard truth that we all need to understand as soon as possible because once you realize that, you're gonna be able to set way better, or not even better, but more accurate goals that are more aligned with the kind of life that you want. The reason why most people fail to make a comeback is because they rely on motivation. Motivation fades. You can't expect to wake up feeling motivated excited, passionate every single day. It's impossible. Discipline doesn't fade. You can wake up tired, frustrated, can be cold outside, it doesn't matter. You're gonna push through regardless of being motivated or not that day and that discipline starts with your routines. Your routines are gonna be your superpower and you should start with small wins. Don't overwhelm yourself with crazy changes. Instead, focus on small, consistent actions. For example, you could wake up 15 minutes earlier tomorrow than you did today. Take those 15 minutes to go over your to-do list, right? feel more prepared for your day. You could commit to always drinking a glass of water as soon as you wake up, or you could commit to writing down one goal for the day and crossing it off before bed. These small actions, right? They feel really small. They build momentum, and momentum builds confidence, discipline, and better habits. And to stay on track, you should track your progress. Every time you tick and routine, mark it down. Seeing those positive streaks are gonna give you a boost of energy. You know, being organized in general will make you more productive, will make you more efficient. And you've probably heard of it, but one of the best platforms for keeping track of your work, your progress, or anything really is Notion. It's a productivity software that I use daily to manage my projects, both personal and work related. And you can use it for note taking, task tracking, and believe it or not, it's free for personal use. They sponsor today's video, so I could show you their new AI features. And the new Notion AI is a game changer, because check this out, if you're a productivity nerd like me, you're gonna love this. You can just ask your Notion AI to hunt down any information inside your Notion. So if I ask, what's the status of the new packaging for the Forte Series Texture Clay? It will find this project or the messages that I've sent my team about it on Slack and give me an accurate answer without me having to spend time looking for it. It's like having a virtual assistant inside Notion. It connects to your Slack and your Google Drive to access information from both platforms, which to me is the best part, right? Because I use Slack to talk to my team. So if I have a conversation today decide the exact date that we're launching the new Forte Shampoo. Let's say, right? But I forget to write it down somewhere. I can just ask Notion AI anytime, hey, what did we decide for the launch date for these products again? And it will know that to me makes Notion AI the best AI tool because it actually has context into what you're working on. And you can ask any questions, ask it to revise your documents or your text. It's a complete game changer. Think about it this way. You could write your to-do list on Notion or your stretch goals and then ask Notion AI How do I achieve these goals over the next five years? Lay out a plan for me so I can achieve my goals. And it will. So get started with Notion for free, and then you can unlock the new Notion AI for only $10 a month with the link in the description below. Being organized and learning to manage your time is one of the greatest skills that a man can have. And if you're serious about turning your life around in 2025, you're gonna have to learn those skills. I use my calendar for everything. This is what a typical week looks like for me. Everything is accounted for. Having an organized calendar is gonna be your best friend if you're trying to really lock in. Start using it as soon as possible because it's gonna change your life. I can guarantee with a calendar, and if it's organized, you're gonna be more productive. All right, just open it on your computer, on your phone, and just keep track of your tasks. But none of that matters if you're making a major mistake that most people make without even realizing it. You can't change your life if you're stuck in the same environment that caused your setbacks in the first place. And that includes the people that you surround yourself with, the content that you consume every day on your phone, on your TV, right? Even your physical environment as in the space you live in. Is this environment helping you grow or is it holding you back? This should be a no-brainer, but if you're in toxic relationships, cut ties with those people that drain your energy, who pull you into bad habits that you know aren't good for you. If you're in a cluttered space, simplify, organize your environment. A clean space is gonna help you have mental clarity. Say no to negative content. You have to replace those mindless social media scrolling with books, podcasts, videos that inspire you, that educate you. And you shouldn't just cut the negative, by the way. You should also look for positive influences, content that stimulates you instead of numbing you, friends that inspire you instead of holding you back. Join communities that are gonna help you achieve your goals. I have a free community of 5,000 guys who are all here to grow together. You don't have to do it alone. You shouldn't. I'll leave the link in my community below. It's called Men's Image Lab and you can join for free if you want to. And just remember that every great comeback actually starts in your mind. So if you're watching this video and you haven't taken any notes, you're not willing to start using a calendar, using a platform like Notion, joining a free community of guys, we're gonna help you. How was this year gonna be different from the last? Think about it this way, you're not stuck, you're planting seeds. When a farmer plants seeds, they don't see the results right away. It takes time, it takes patience, and it takes some care for those plants to grow. You're working 2025, might not even pay off right away. I get it, it's frustrating, but trust the process. Visualize the person you want to become. Picture yourself in six months, a year, five years from now. Who is that person? What do they do daily? Start acting like that person today. And for that to happen, you're gonna have to master the art of saying no. Let me tell you something most people don't understand, a success? This is something I didn't realize until way too late in my life. It's not about doing more, it's actually about doing less, but doing it better. If you say yes to everything, how are you gonna have time to get your work done? to lock in and push your projects forward. This year, you have to learn to say no to distractions that don't align with your goals, relationships that drain your energy, opportunities that look great on the surface, but don't move you closer to your stretch goals. Instead, double down on the things that truly matter, working towards your goals, spending time with the people that you love, growing your community, getting stronger and better mentally and physically. Because remember that your mind and your body, if they're weak, everything else crumbles. So yeah, work hard, but remember to be physically active, eat clean, and get enough sleep. A strong body fuels a strong mind. And Harvard study actually found that regular exercise improves not just physical health, but also your decision-making and stress management skills. So if you wanna make better choices in 2025, start with your health. And if I had to guess, the majority of people will have this goal in their new year's resolution, right? To get more physically fit. Some people wanna lose weight, some people wanna gain muscle mass. And another goal I guarantee most people, if not every single person will write down is to make more money. Of course, right? But the problem is that a lot of people are scared to talk about money. Even the word money has become a scary word, right? But you can't let that word scare you. Say it right now, money. It's the currency that we use to live our lives and you can't really make a comeback without financial stability. You need to understand your numbers. How much are you spending? How much are you saving? Where can you cut back without sacrificing your quality of life too much. If you're scared of money, you don't think about this stuff, right? And you end up broke because you never took the time to understand it. How can you not take time to understand the currency that you need to live your life? For anything from food, entertainment, technology, shelter, everything has a price tag, a number. Learn as much as you can about it. And you will see that money actually is an evil. It's your friend. It can take you on a fun trip. It can buy you a nice dinner. It can help your family. So set specific financial goals for 2025, all right? You need to be specific. Maybe it's paying off your debt, saving for an emergency fund, investing in a new skill or a business, whatever it is, make a plan and stick to it. Remember that long-term financial success, it's really not about how much you make, it's about how much you keep. 2025 is your year. Instead of fearing failure, fear regret. Fear looking back at the end of 2025 and realizing, I played it safe. I just didn't do it. I didn't go for it. Fear that the greatest rewards are gonna come from the biggest risks. Everyone knows that. This is your year to rise, to rebuild, to thrive, but it all starts with a decision, a decision to take control, to stop making excuses and to start moving forward. I believe in you. Now it's your time to believe in yourself. So let's make this the greatest comeback year of your life."

        "transcript": " Let me guess, you have a closet full of clothes, but still feel like you have nothing to wear, right? We've all been there. And the first thing you think of when that happens is, I need to buy more clothes. I don't have enough, but that's wrong. You probably have more clothes than you need. They're just not the right pieces. You need clothes that show the world who you are. Think about James Bond in Skyfall with his perfectly tailored namey tuxedo. Chris Evans in Knives Out in that iconic cable knit sweater. Or David Beckham stepping out in a classic gray, double breasted suit. These guys, they don't wear clothes, they own them. In this video, I'm gonna show you exactly how to make smarter purchases to level up your style and find a look that's uniquely you. Let's get started. When I first started caring about style, I was honestly overwhelmed with all of the options out there. I would walk into stores and I would see racks and racks of clothes, patterns, colors, cuts, and I'd honestly just grab anything that was trendy at the time thinking that that's what I needed to wear. That's how I was gonna look good. and spoiler alert, it didn't look good. But then I learned the most important rule of style, and that is fit is king. And I know a lot of guys don't wear suits anymore, which is a shame, but let me go back to that example of Daniel Craig in Skyfall for a second. The suits he wears, they're not flashy, they're not screaming for attention, they're not trendy, they fit him perfectly. That's what makes him stand out. A well-fitted suit instantly elevates your look, even if it's simple. Too loose and you look sloppy, too tight, it looks like you borrowed your little brother's clothes, it starts to pull everywhere. And it's not just about suits, all right? So everything from your t-shirts to your jeans, they should fit well. And here's a quick hack. When you're trying something on, ask yourself, does this follow the lines of my body? Does it accentuate my features? And if the answer is no, leave it on the rack. Personally, I've tried it all. You've seen me in skinny jeans, unfortunately, right? And you've seen me in baggier looks that I wouldn't even wear today. But you can see in my recent videos that more and more, I'm just neaning you to more of a traditional fit. Straight cut pants that don't pull or hug my legs too tight, roomier jacket, and here's something that I learned in the process. I'm five nine, all right? So I like my style to elongate my legs, which then makes me look taller, right? I thought skinny tapered jeans would do that, but I found that that's actually incorrect. Straight cut pants, high waisted pants, and pants that aren't hemmed too high, so a slight break on top of your shoes, that will actually make your legs take up more real estate in your outfit, which makes them look longer, more pronounced, makes you look taller. It's a good tip for my short kings out there. Now, once you're nail the fit, let's talk about the colors. Most men get this wrong. They lean into these loud patterns or bold colors, thinking that it's gonna make them stand out, right? And the truth is, neutral tones, navy, gray, white, black, brown, they work for every man. They're timeless, they're easy to mix and match. Look at Kendall Roy in succession. His wardrobe is the definition of power through simplicity. It's muted colors. It's clean lines, nothing that screams for attention. And fun fact that has absolutely nothing to do with this video, I went to a Knicks game last week and I sat right behind Kieran Culkin, AKA Roman Roy from Succession, which was really cool. And Madison Square Garden, man, it was packed with celebrities that night. That's it, I just wanted the name job. I just wanted it to look cool. Going back to the topic here, what's the practical takeaway for all of this, right? Simply start with the basics. A black polo, a crisp white shirt, cable knit sweater, tailored trousers, classy shoes, loafers, clean white leather sneakers. These are the pieces that form the backbone of your wardrobe, the foundation that you can build on. But of course, these are just suggestions based on a traditional masculine style, right? But style isn't about clothes, it's about who you are. It's about showing people what kind of person you are with one glance. The best dressed man, they'll just copy the trends out there. They find a a look that fits their personality and their lifestyle. So let's figure out your style because it might be different from mine and it probably is and that's okay. For example, there's the rugged look and I think of Ryan Gosling and Drive when I think of the rugged look, right? It's that iconic bomber jacket, the scorpion patch on the back, right? It's tough, it's masculine, it has this cool, careless vibe to it. And this style works really well for guys who like a little bit of edge. Maybe you're into leather jackets, boots, raw denim. This is for the guy who wants to be stylish but with a bit of edge with some ruggedness to it. Maybe you ride a motorcycle, or maybe you just like the tough look of a leather jacket and boots. The rugged look is a really cool look. Next is the sophisticated look. Think James Bond and Casino Royale. The perfectly tailored suit. The polished leather shoes, the classic black tie, even wearing a polo with trousers and loafers. That's considered sophisticated. Sharp. This style is for men who want to project elegance and confidence. It's great if your lifestyle leans into this more formal events, you know, business settings, or you just enjoy dressing sharp and elegant. And then there's casual cool. Chris Hemsworth is actually a great example. He can pull off a hoodie, slim fit jeans and sneakers, and still look incredible, right? Chris Evans does the same thing, but he elevates it a little bit more with his polos or his cardigans. And this is for the guys who want comfort, but don't want to sacrifice style. If you spend your weekends looking out with your friends, or running errands, but you want to look good at the same time, and here's the best part. You can actually have all of those styles at the same time. Obviously you're not gonna wear a rugged, sophisticated look in the same outfit, but you can have rugged outfits in your closet, you can have sophisticated outfits in your closet and casual cool fits in your closet. And then you can just cycle through them as you see fit, as your mood changes, as the situation and the environment changes around you. I literally will change from a rugged look in the morning to a sophisticated style at night, just because I wanna have fun with it. And I'm a good example because if you go back into my YouTube videos, my Instagram page, you're gonna see all sorts of style. And what does that mean? I'm just testing things out. There's a lot of really bad outfits. There's a lot of really great ones too. And the great ones wouldn't be as great if I hadn't sucked with those bad styles. Because I tried, it didn't work. Now I know, hey, this doesn't work for me. It's not for my body type. It's not for my lifestyle. Let me try something different. So style is all about practice. I wasn't born stylish. People aren't born with, it's not a natural talent. It's something that you develop over time through practice and that's what I want for you. And it's easier to start with one instead of just trying all of these three styles. Start with one, master it, and then move on to the next one if you want to. And here's an easy way to figure out your personal style. Think about your unique lifestyle first. What do you spend the most time doing? If you're in an office five days a week, the sophisticated look might be your go-to. If you're more outdoorsy and you're always hiking, you know, just going outside, the rugged look could be your lane. Now, second, you have to reflect on your personality. Are you involved in outgoing, or are you laid back and easygoing? Your style should reflect that. A bomber jacket can say mysterious, while a crisp white shirt says dependable, right? Trustworthy. Once you know your personal style, it becomes easier to shop, it becomes easier to build outfits, and way easier to feel confident in what you're wearing, which is exactly what I want for you. Actually, drop a comment below with your favorite style. Is it rugged, sophisticated, or is it casual cool? and I'm gonna try to respond as many as possible. Now, a brand that has great options, no matter if your personal style is rugged, sophisticated, or casual, cool, is Peacebird. They've been around since 1996, and they have almost 4,000 physical stores in China. If you like a rugged look, they have these beautiful vintage leather jackets, these modern denim jackets, great straight jeans. If you like a sophisticated style, they have these beautiful overcoats, classy polos, and if you're more of a casual, cool kind of guy, I mean, they have so many options, bomber jackets like this one. I also like this wool jacket. This gradient brown sweater stands out without being over the top. It's cool, it's modern, and it can be dressed up or down. They have a ton of different styles, colors, options. I also like the fact that not a lot of people in the US are wearing this brand yet, so it has this exclusive feeling to it, even though they were featured in the New York Fashion Week. They're just getting started here in the US, so you'd be one of the first ones to wear them brand. The pricing is already pretty reasonable, especially considering the quality, which you can see right here. But they're giving you guys 20% off from being subscribers of the channel.

Thank you Peace Bird for sponsoring today's video and supporting my channel and my team so that we can keep posting these videos on YouTube. Which brings us to the next section of this video. Shopping. Most guys, you just walk into a store and grab whatever's on sale, right? And then you hope it works out. But the truth is, dressing better, it starts with buying better. So here's how to shop strategically and build a wardrobe that actually works for you, that's actually filled with things that you're gonna wear instead of things that you're never gonna wear. First, invest in timeless pieces. Look at Marlon Brando in the wild one. This movie came out in 1953 and that leather jacket is as iconic today as it was then. Why? Remember this, traditional pieces do not follow trends. A well-made leather jacket, a classic navy blazer, a great pair of loafers, it's always gonna look good. Second, avoid cheap, low quality clothes. I get it, cheap can be really intriguing, right? It can be a great deal, convenient, but it comes at a cost that you might not see right away. Those $20 shirts, they might seem like a good deal, but they're gonna fall apart after a few washes and leave you back at square one. The truth is, high quality items just last longer. They look better. And I'm not saying more expensive items, I'm saying high quality items, right? They look better. They actually save you money in the long run. and it's about buying less, but buying smarter. And here's a pro tip, use the cost per wear calculation to decide if something is worth it. So this is what I do. Let's say you buy a $200 leather jacket and you wear it twice a week for five years. That's over 500 wares, making the cost less than 50 cents per wear. Now compare that to a $50 fast fashion jacket that you're only gonna wear 10 times before it falls apart. That's $5 per wear. Quality wins every single time. While you're at it, let me save you some more money. Seasonal sales are your best friends. High quality brands, they slash their prices during the end of season sales. Black Friday, Christmas time, holiday sales, summer clearance event, sample sales. Keep an eye on those. Save money, why not? And before you buy, ask yourself these questions. I want you to really ask yourself these questions instead of just grabbing, taking it home, then you rip off the tags, then you put it on and you're about to go out and you're like, that's actually not as nice as I thought. It looked better in the store. That's a waste of money. So ask yourself these questions before you take it home. One, does it fit the personal style that I want to achieve? If it doesn't align with your unique style, skip it. That's okay, you're gonna find something better. Two, am I going to wear this often? If you can't see yourself wearing it weekly or at least monthly, it's probably not worth it. A good way to measure this is to flip your hangers when you wear something in your closet. And then if you go back to your closet and see that a lot of your hangers haven't been touched, those were probably not smart purchases. If they've been sitting there for six months and not flipped, That means that you should probably donate them, get rid of them and get something different. Number three, is the quality there? Check the fabric, check the stitching, check the materials, the fit. If it feels flimsy, that's a no-go. When you shop with intention, you stop wasting money on clothes that you're never gonna wear and you start actually building a wardrobe that you're genuinely proud of. It's not about having more options, it's about having better options. Let's talk about the ultimate style hack here. It's not something that I've talked about a lot, but I'm about to change that because I truly, truly believe in this. Maybe you've heard of the term capsule wardrobe. Think of it as having fewer pieces, but endless combinations. The idea is very simple. Invest in versatile, high quality essentials that you can mix and match effortlessly. And you're gonna start with the essential items. For example, if your style is sophisticated, you're gonna get some Oxford shirts. Crisp white, light blue, they work for everything from casual Fridays to dinner dates, right? Then you go to the trousers. Navy, beige, those are classic, right? And then they pair perfectly with almost anything. Quality footwear, think white leather sneakers, black loafers, wool coats, a tan, a black coat, right? An overcoat instantly elevates your outfit. Now, let's talk about accessories. A great watch, like an Omega C Master would be incredible, right? If you can afford that, I know they're very pricey, I understand. But also a vintage-inspired Seiko can add character to even a very simple look. Sunglasses like a classic Ray-Man Wayfarers or Persols, they give you that polished, put-together vibe. Take inspiration from David Beckham. His wardrobe is literally filled with versatility. Whether he's in a tailored suit or rocking a plain tee with jeans or in a leather jacket, I mean, he's had hundreds of looks so I can go on forever. Every piece looks intentional. It works together very seamlessly and that's the power of a capsule wardrobe. Be your pieces more impact, more option. But of course, even with all this knowledge that you've already learned from this one video, I'm still not done because none of that works unless you follow this style rules that I'm about to lay out for you. And I know some people cringe when someone says style rules, right? I get it. But the truth is, every stylish man knows there are a few rules that you should never break. Here are the ones that you need to live by. Number one, fit over brand. And I learned this the hard way because I was buying expensive clothes that just did not fit my body type. A $50 blazer that fits perfectly will always look better than a $500 designer jacket and doesn't look at Harvey's specter from suits. His sharp tailoring is what makes him powerful, not just the price tag of his suits. You don't even know what brand that suit is. Number two, know your color palette. Wearing colors that compliment your skin tone instantly enhances your look. Tom Ford's monochrome outfits are a masterclass in this, right? They're very simple, very sleek, but always, always effective. Number three is you have to prioritize versatility. Build your wardrobe around pieces that you can wear from multiple occasions. For example, a black polo. You can wear a black polo to pretty much anything you wanna do besides going to the gym. You can wear it for anything. Groceries, out with your friends, out on a date. You can wear it to work. I mean, it works, right? And number four, subscribe to my YouTube channel if you haven't, come on, you made it this far. It's free and I promise to help you look and feel your absolute best. And I'm gonna help you stay away from these style mistakes that are easily avoidable. There are some style mistakes that you really just need to block from your life, all right? And even the best of us have made these mistakes, including myself, but the good news is they're easy to fix. One, wearing clothes that are too baggy or too tight. When you're trying something on, don't just stand there and look in the mirror when you're at the store. Move around, sit down, see how the clothes fit into your life, your lifestyle. Tailor your clothes to fit in your body and your lifestyle, not someone else's. Two is over accessorizing. I used to do this a lot. A watch, a belt, maybe a bracelet, that's all you need. Too many rings or necklaces and whatever. It just distracts your overall look. Three is following trends blindly. Something that I used to do again. Trends come and go, but styles opposed to last. Remember those ultra skinny jeans, those ultra baggy pants, not a good idea. This dummy here, I used to wear them all the time. But you should always invest in timeless pieces because you can wear those forever. It's funny, there's so many photos of me wearing oversized graffitis and saggy jeans and skinny jeans that I hope never seen the light of day. But hey, we learn, we grow, and we get better. So to immediately have a better style, it really only comes down to this. Find out what your personal style is. Make smart purchasing decisions based on that style. Build a foundation with quality essentials that fit you, that fit your lifestyle. Follow the style rules that work and avoid the common mistakes that men make like following trends blindly. Style is more than clothes, it's a statement. The next time you shop or get dressed, think about the story that you're telling with your style, with your outfit. Are you presenting yourself as a confident, put together an intentional man? If not, it's time to start. And remember, style isn't just about looking good, it's about feeling confident, commanding respect, and being the best version of yourself. Let's elevate your style and in turn, your life. You got this, I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Growing up, I always wanted my space to look good. So as soon as I got my first job at Domino's Pizza, I started saving so I could make my bedroom look better. So I could buy a new chair, a new monitor, some artwork. This was my bedroom when I was 17 years old. I didn't have money to change the wallpaper or to get a fresh paint job, but I did what I could with the little money that I had. And at this time, I was working at Best Buy. So I got a good discount on the speakers, the computer, the monitor, the chair. So when I started making real money, I moved into my dream apartment and I decided it was time to splurge. It was time to make this place look really good. And this isn't just my apartment. I work from home, so I wanted it to be special. I don't wanna wake up or work in a place that doesn't inspire me. So here are some of the things that I bought from my apartment that weren't cheap but I don't regret buying them at all. And then at the end of this video, I'm gonna give you some of the affordable pieces that I also think are worth your time and money. One of the very first things I bought when I moved to New York City was this 49 inch monitor from ASUS. This thing is a beast, it's massive, It cost me $800. The stand for some reason cost me $400, so half the price of the monitor. But it is really good because you can move it up, down, you can tilt it. But the thing is, I'm always looking at this monitor. I work here, I work from home, I'm here a lot. So for me, I just wanted something that was effective, that made me more productive. Something that I could look at every day and have three different screens going on at the same time, and just making sure that I could keep an eye on everything that's going on in my business. What I like about this stand, and the reason why I spent 400 bucks on it, is because it clears out the bottom here of my desk so I can put things there and it doesn't take up as much room on my desk. When I started looking for design inspiration for this apartment, I kept seeing one thing over and over again. And I know that's not enough reason for you to buy it because it sounds like you're copying other people but it just spoke to me. And that was these books. Honestly, the Tom Ford books specifically, I kept seeing them everywhere. This is the 002 version, but I also have the black version. That was my first book, the first the core book that I ever bought for my apartment. I love black and white. As you can see from my apartment, it's very minimalist, very black and white. And the Tom Ford books just fit in perfectly. After the Tom Ford book, I wanted to buy a few more just to bring in some warmth. So I bought this Louis Vuitton book. I bought that one as well. And then there's an Aster Martin book in my bedroom. Even in this credenza here, I have a bunch of extra books, some that I've actually read and a lot of them, honestly, just for the core, like a Gucci book, Alexander McQueen book. I have a lot of books about cars, Aston Martin, Andrew Newey's, how to build a car. So, and then even fashion books as well, which sometimes I'll display, this one I've actually read as well. When you're decorating your apartment or your bedroom, you might find some empty spaces and that's when books come in. They go really well on top of things like the Skridenza or your computer desk or maybe even a coffee table like we have those here. But right now, of course, we took most of them out and just left these two because we have the Christmas decorations, but books are a really great way of filling that space, just adding some charm and elegance to your place. And something that made a huge difference here in my apartment was getting this Murphy bed. If you guys don't know yet, a Murphy bed is basically just a bed that kind of goes up against the wall. So this inside here, there is a mattress and it basically just comes down. And so if you don't have a lot of space in your apartment or if you don't need a second bed somewhere else, just once in a while, when you have guests, this is a really great thing because it basically saves you so much space, right? So much room in this room. I actually shoot my YouTube videos. I have a lot of storage in this room. So I don't need a bed down at all times and I only have guests maybe once every month or once every couple of months, which means like the space can be very open. I can do whatever I have to do. And then once I have guests coming in, I'll just bring this down, set up the bed and it looks great. They're kind of a bit to install and put up so I had it done professionally and They're kind of expensive, it cost me $1,200, but honestly, extremely worth it. You have to buy the mattress, you put it in there and it saves you so much room. So if you live in a small space and you don't have a lot of guests coming in, this is a really great purchase. So directly across from the Murphy bed, we have this desk that I just bought last year from Creighton Barrel or CB2, I'll link it below. But this desk is just unbelievably beautiful. It's called a waterfall desk, so it has these rounded sides and it's heavy. It's really, really heavy. You might recognize this little nook, this corner here from my videos on YouTube. This is exactly where I shoot my videos, kind of in the middle here, I'll just face that way. But I love this because it looks really great in my videos of course. But then again, anytime a guest comes over, they have the Murphy bed right here, and they have the desk right here so they can get some work done. So not only does it look great, it's also functional. And that's why I decided to splurge on this desk because it does look amazing and it is practical. Something I started to realize as I got older is that these in-ceiling lights for, especially these new apartments, these modern apartments, they're really harsh. So if you wanna create kind of a vibe, a cool ambience inside of your apartment, you're gonna need lamps. And that's what I decided to do just a few months ago, about a year ago. I decided to buy some lamps. I got floor lamps from Gantry. They make really great lamps. And then I also got tabletop lamps from Gantry and it looks great. It just adds a nice little soft light, soft touch to your apartment, as opposed to these really just almost aggressive lights that go into the ceiling. They're very practical, right? You move into a place, you hit the light switch, the light is on, but they're harsh, they're aggressive. They don't really create a nice mood. So this is really great mood lighting. Also, it looks great, right? It's part of the decor. This one, of course, is black. It goes really well with everything else that I have in here. So this is a pro tip for you men watching this who don't really know how to create a cool ambiance, how to create a cool vibe inside your apartment. A lot of times it's the lighting. Lighting changes everything in your apartment. So I didn't mind splurge here on these. I think there were about, this one was like $500. That one was maybe $250, $300. But to me, it was absolutely worth it because it changed the entire vibe in here. This next item is something really masculine that I got. Once I started collecting watches, and I knew I needed something like this. For you guys that don't know, a watch winder basically just winds your watches so that you don't have to change the time or date because it's actually just going at all times. So you can open it here, you can change the settings, the speed, what you want it, which way you want your watch to turn into, or if you want it to go back and forth to left and right. So it's really cool. It ranges really anywhere from $500 to $5,000. This one is on the more affordable side. I think it was like $750 to $1,000, which is affordable in the watch wine in the world. And no, it doesn't stay here on top of this desk. Usually it's tucked away safely somewhere else, but it's really practical so that I don't have to keep changing the time on my watches every time I grab them from my safe. And now for a lightning round and more affordable things in my apartment, but that I still recommend. Kendall warmer, plants, bar cart, a watch stand, this desk valet, air pod stand, this telescope, artwork, and LED light strips. These are all things that make my apartment either more organized or more stylish or both. If you enjoyed this video, make sure to hit that subscribe button below and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Hello, how are you? How was your birthday? Where were you? In St. Pete. Ah, St. Pete. Cool. The coach of tennis racket, the presents. I had to call my mom, you know, it's her birthday this weekend. I had to say hi. I called her, obviously, on her birthday, but she was busy with her friends, so I just wanted to call again and see how everything went. I had to call my mom, you know, it was her birthday this weekend. I had to say hi. I called her obviously on her birthday, but she was busy with her friends, so I just wanted to call again and see how everything went. It's one of those things that kind of suck living far from your family. I don't have any family here in New York City. She's in Tampa, so she's a two and a half hour flight away. But you know, we try to talk as much as possible. Kids call your moms. Say hi. Say I love you. cool and you know what else is cool? What are we doing Rodrigo? Something fun. This isn't gonna be a thing every vlog just so you guys know but we're gonna pick up another car right now and it's a banger. I might even say this is my dream dream car. Like if I could have a car right now in New York City this would be the car. I have to say though every single time I get a rental here in New New York City, I get a ticket, a parking ticket. Every single time without fail. So let's pray that it doesn't happen this time. We're like five minutes away. Do you guys know what card is? All right, not gonna lie, there's a lot of really sick cars here. This is unbelievable. This one is so, so sick. Real question is which one are you taking? So many options. I mean, which one do you think is my dream car in here? Bronco? McLaren? Lambo? Bentley? I mean, the Porsche is pretty sick too. All right, let's go get our car. [\"Metro-Crossing\"] This is McLaren 750S, it's my dream car. I'll say my dream car would be the convertible, the Spyder, but I'll definitely take this. It's a beauty. I got to drive it with Rodrigo actually in Vegas. McLaren invited us out for the launch and it was so, so sick. So when they offered me this car here in New York City, I couldn't say no. I'm going to have it for a few days and I'm definitely going to enjoy it. Let's go for a drive. What do you say we go get some coffee? If you watched the first one, you know I was laughing. It's a process man, we're getting you there. The last thing I want is for you to get a coffee date and get there in order of Frappuccino. So we're gonna get you there, don't worry, don't worry. Part two of the regigo, but we're gonna call it the coffee chronicles. The coffee chronicles, I like that, I like that. Actually we have to sit down and think about what we want to do with the car anyway, because we actually haven't had time to think about the content that we're gonna shoot with the car. So we can find a coffee shop that hopefully has some parking around it, and then sit down and come up with some content ideas for the McLaren. What do you think? Yeah, let's do it. Alright, let's get to work. So what are you gonna have? Damn it. I haven't even looked yet. I would say... Obviously you're gonna like the mocha. Or... You're like a... Bokken spice plaza. I should probably like that. Yeah, I'll be down to try that. It's the season, it's getting cold out. So we were gonna do a little work session out here, but as you can see, it's very windy and it's cold. Fall is definitely here, but... We're gonna find somewhere warm before we do that. Or, Drigo, what's the coffee with you? Let's hear it. All right. Pumpkin spice latte? Pumpkin spice latte. You're first. First ever. The face is, bro. You're killing me. You're killing me. I was going to be a little sweeter. That's why. Oh, my God. You always think they're going to be sweeter, girl. So it kind of surprised me. But like I said, it's drinkable. Drinkable is nuts. It's nuts. Honestly? This is literally the most basic coffee drink ever. Honestly, I actually like this one. I'll give this one probably a seven. I'm not gonna lie. At some point you're gonna like coffee, dude. It's okay. I got you. Well, let's figure out what we wanna shoot with the car because we have it till Friday. And never will we shot a cart in a while for Instagram. I feel like we need to do something cool. So we're obviously going through this little rebrand situation where we don't want it to be like, to like fashion influencer. We want it to be aspirational, inspirational. We want it to be classy, elegant. Something more lifestyle related I think would be good. The only way you could do to for inspirational post is like you get that photo of your old car, it's like I started with this and then and then it's like I ended in this. And then we just show crew shots and you just like trap in the car. Yeah. Find like a good audio that's like inspirational. So you're like an inspirational. So like how it started, how it's going. Yeah. That's a good one. I like that. Yeah, I like that. I feel like that would do very, very well. Okay, and then the aspirational on screen text. [\"Street Dance\"] So what are people saying about the vlog? Dude, it's been really good. The feedback's been so positive that I wanted to take a second and thank you guys so much for everything. I mean, you know, the comments, this is quite literally the best vlog I've ever watched. No glaze. It's the cinematography, the video quality, everything's so good. Need more day in the life vlogs. And then there's this one comment. I want to see you make a video about you react to Penguin's video about your morning routine. And if you guys don't know, there's like this big YouTuber, Penguin, who reacted to my morning routine video. And he was like basically just talking about morning routine videos in general and saying that there's no purpose to morning routine videos, especially when it comes from rich people, right? He doesn't know who I am. This guy has no idea what I've been through and what I did to get here. And he's literally just trying to undermine everything that I've done to get to where I am today. And his points are so dumb that honestly doesn't even warrant any type of response from me. When PewDiePie did his reaction to my morning routine videos, it was funny. It was quirky. I reacted in a funny way. For this guy, Penguin, critical, whatever his name is, it wasn't even funny. He said that he wants people, rich people to do a realistic morning routine where they wake up, f***ed up from ayahuasca, puking all over themselves. That's the most unrealistic f*** that I've ever heard of. I'm trying to breed positivity. I'm trying to show you guys that you can do it too. It's not me showing off what I have going on. And that's why I haven't even vlogged for eight years, for eight years, because I didn't want to be a show off. I didn't want to show you this, what my life and what I have going on. I want it to be more private, right? And it's so funny to see people like him hating on sponsored content. When you look at his videos and there's brands plastered all over the place, when the first link in his description is a link that will make him money. When literally all he does is show people for money. And to me, that's it. There's nothing else to say besides, I don't give a f**k about this guy. Like I don't care. I really don't care. So that's my response. You can keep doing those videos. I'll keep shooting my videos and the world goes on. She looks like a spaceship dude. What a beauty. How's it going man? How are you doing? It's me, Alex. Kevin. Kevin, how's it going? Nothing much. It's just... Heading over to Williamsburg so we got to cross the bridge and traffic crossing the bridge at this time is always a nightmare so we're kind of stuck here. But it's funny because, you know, the car is pretty bright, right? And every time I look at a guy and we make eye contact, he just, they just go. Just the look of approval from men about the McLaren is just so funny to me. Girls, they don't even look. Don't even care. You know, it's like that saying, if you want to impress girls, it's not going to be with a watch or a car. At least not the right girls, anyway. We're headed over to million Williamsburg because we're actually playing paddle which is this new ish sport It's a combination of pickleball and squash kind of and I've been playing it for a little bit and I really like it I want to get into it So we're gonna check out this these courts that they have in Williamsburg I'm playing with three friends Marcel Daniel and Garrett and I'm gonna take you guys along What do you think? That's so cool. Yeah, that did. Yeah. This thing is a little... Beautiful. I haven't seen this up to a New York City person. Nope. Yeah, I'm driving a 720, but... It's a space ship. It's so fast. It's like, it's a little scary driving in New York. It's not gonna lie. Yeah, dude. With how bad these roads are. So many, yeah, so many potholes, and then so many people crossing in bikes and stuff too. Yeah, she's so, so, so... Does it have air filter, whatever? Come up to like a speed bump or something? Yeah, so you just pass the button. It takes like seven seconds. Yeah, I'll just go up to that. Behind the scenes of an Instagram photo shoot right here. Garrett's a homie. He's traveling tonight, so he's not going to get to enjoy the McLaren with me. So I was like, yo, I'll drive to you right now. Just shoot the car, enjoy it. Because it's so sick and I mean this view. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I'm gonna go get some water. I was nervous as fuck. Yeah, yeah, I'm really excited. You guys tired? I mean, tired. We're warming up. Yeah, I'm not. I don't get tired. I don't get tired. I'm tired. So this dude just ran a marathon. He's over here sweating after five minutes. I'm very playful. You played for the first time ever. Dude, it's so fun. Yeah, dude, I'm getting this. This is nice. This is where I can see myself getting. I think pickleball is fun, but I think just just add the whole other element to it. You know, it's asking me. I'm not gonna lie. The feeling, the sounds, the stuff. This is it. I love tennis. It's such a huge amount of character. It's a tennis. It's like, you can't keep fighting with your... And you can smash it off the walls, which that's, that's favorite. That's what's really fun. Oh yeah. We're gonna play a game. Here we go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. If you want to get in that little rake, that's what the XXX is. Yeah, the funny thing about Jack Johnson is he's pretty technically skilled. He makes it sound so natural. Yeah, he makes it sound like he's just at the beach playing the ukulele. Exactly. It's a good brand. Yeah. Nice. Good. We can start with the YouTube ABT. We can start with the YouTube AB test on all three and just do the title. How to lock in and get done or like how to lock in and actually get done something like that that works for all the thumbnails. We want to just use TubeBuddy then for the AB test right after we launch. Yeah. So we pick the best packaging. We do manually everything. So let's pick one thumbnail to start with. I'm assuming the one in the middle is probably the best one. I'm going to send Rupesh a video today since he's going to be done with Aura, which is a jacket maker that's due Tuesday. So for Peaceburg, what I can do is I'm going to finish writing the script. I'll shoot it by Friday. William, let's send it to Seren. Even Seren, it's going to be kind of tight for him. Honestly, maybe I just try to push back with the brand and see if we can post it a little bit later. May I probably just email Text to Netta and just let him know that we're going to be a little bit late with Peacebird. We're about to give Truffle his very first bath. He's a little squirmy right now. You smell so good. He's doing way better than I thought he would. Good boy. He looks a little rad. That's a good to see. I'm so good to see. My little rat sucker. You're such a good boy. You're going to love the water. You're going to be a swimmer. He's like anything for treats. Yeah. Some nice eyelashes. Dude, look at you. Going to get the port table a while after this. Yeah. OK. We're going to give you a quip. We're going to give you a pompadour. Which porté product would you use on it? Let's do a porté tutorial. A pompadour. A pompadour. A pompadour. Good job. Good boy. Don't they look like fur? They're like... You got the Uggs on. Now for your favorite part. The blow dry. Yeah buddy. Good boy. Good boy. Good boy. Goddaddyduddy. What a thought. Huh? So nice that he doesn't shed. Draw your face. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I was just looking at your YouTube. You're doing great work on that thing. Oh, thank you man. I appreciate it. I was saying, there needs to be way more pages for men like learning how to do style and how to be a man. You know what I mean? It's just not enough out there to me from what I said. No, honestly, that's literally why, you know, when I first started doing YouTube, I was really like gaming. So I had a male heavy audience, but then I started showing a little bit of my life, like fitness and fashion. And they were like, you can play games and be stylish, that's crazy. I can play. And then they started to follow me for that kind of advice. So I realized there's like a really big gap the market and this was like you know seven eight years ago and it's still the case. So tell me you got the puppies so tell me about the puppy how can I help you with this new puppy? Yeah I mean we're fresh we're green when it comes to puppies and dogs. I've never trained a puppy before. Emily's had like a family dog so she grew up with a dog a couple dogs but I'm super super fresh. I've been watching a lot of videos like binging your stuff going through YouTube and like She's reading, listening to like, Cesar Milan's like, you know, audio book. So yeah, we're just trying to figure it out. You know, we want to be good dog parents. We want them to be very well trained. His name is Truffle. So we want this dog to realize you guys as parent figure in the relationship, not as we're friends, kind of siblings. Because you gotta remember, that guy is a boy or a girl? He's a boy. Okay, he's coming from his mom. Who is definitely a back leader, right? She was definitely a rule-bounder limitation. This is how it goes. I don't feel bad about it. I'm doing this for your well-being, and I'm gonna provide that guidance and leadership for you. Okay, let's go start. But the fragrances in here are extra special to me. These are my first ever fragrances for my brand Forte series. They took three years to develop, and they're finally here. This is the first batch of them. Antagonist, this one, he's the anti-hero, you know? It's the villain of the story. When you want to go out and be up to no good, go to a party, go to an event, and you just want to stand out antagonist, right? And now when I look at my brand, I'm so proud, man. I'm proud of myself for how far I've come. And I'm extremely, extremely proud of my team and the guys that are following me, you guys. Both of these fragrances are out right now in the Forte Cease website. Today's the big launch date. That's a wrap. That's a wrap. So good. I feel like cats out of the bag, fringes are out. No verb is 16th, here we go. We have two days to edit this video, so maybe we'll get to it. Yeah. Let's go. Oh, man. I'm pumped. That's what you get for working in New York. New York prices. See now why I don't have a car then. Thanks, it just makes no sense. That was for three days and wasn't able to follow. It was like two and a half days. $300 for parking. I'm gonna get a haircut. Obviously I really need it as you guys can tell. I don't remember the last time I got a haircut. It's been a month or more. So it's time to get this taken care of. And I'm genuinely worried. I just don't know if we're gonna find parking because I've never driven there before. I always Uber. And that's the thing, it just makes sense to Uber. I just get an Uber black and yes, it's expensive. Let's say, as opposed to other cities, it's like 50 bucks. But that's what I'm gonna pay for parking anyway. And then you have the car and then you have insurance and then you have monthly parking at the building, et cetera, et cetera. Overall, it's just not a really good business idea to have a car in Manhattan. It just doesn't really work. We finally made it. We made it. We didn't show you guys, but I took the complete wrong turn and went to the wrong salon. What's going on? Good to see you. Looking sharp today. Yeah. We're doing a vlog for YouTube. Welcome to the vlog. Sure. Yeah. That's your wrong. He's been taking care of my hair for like a year over a year now. Over a year, yeah. I keep going back and forth on letting it grow. I kind of like the line, honestly. Yeah, it's a little too much. You did? Yeah. I don't know, maybe here, we definitely bring it down a lot. Yeah. On the top, though, I kind of like it. Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we leave the length and then take some other way? Yeah. Take a lot out from here, so it's not so bulky. And then we got to dye these. Mitted marks, yeah. We got to dye these stress marks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and that's it Yeah, cuz I don't really I've never had a puppy I've never had to train on others So it's my first time doing it and I just don't know what to do. So I found this guy online. It's like really really good Professional and he has a ranch in New Jersey. Oh and he did he has this puppy enrichment program so we can take him in for like three weeks and And it's fairly supposed to be really good. I was like, oh, we're not gonna find parking It's gonna be so difficult and then there was a parking right in front of it. Well, the good thing It's only two hours there. So it's like oh nice. Yeah Way better. So when you guys come to Marcia, I'll be going to get your haircut. Check this out. You also have the Forte products right here. So you can get the Forte products here. Make sure to book your appointments. Get your room. We're re-headed. We're going to get some coffee. And then typically after I get a haircut here, I know there's a really cool flower shop and plant shop. Two blocks away. So I usually go and get Emily some flowers. How's it going? Good. How sweet is your mocha? Um, I mean it's a mocha so it's fairly sweet. I would say it's not a starbucks cake. Can you do like half sweet or no? I would also like half the chocolate though. Let's do one half sweet and one normal hot with almond milk. Both hot and cold? Yeah. Right? Yeah. You want full sweet? Yeah. Full sweet for me. Look at these, they're so nice. I love this spot. It's called Plant Shed. Really nice plants and flowers and coffee. Yeah? Oh, he's there now. Okay. Okay, I'm walking back. Alright, next spot. Salon just called. The ticketing officer is walking around. It doesn't want us to get a ticket. I swear, man. Having your car in New York. It's just so fun. There it is. Most people are buying the collection. Yeah, yeah. And then this one guy just got the collection plus an additional atomizer. Yeah. I don't know why you did that. So you can have two, one for each. So yeah. That's awesome. That's an antagonist and animizer. Hell yeah. Yeah, good. Hell yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, we got a lot of stuff queued up to promote. Amazing. Okay, I mean over all the Vegas launch is looking pretty good already. It's just so good to see this uptick right away, especially knowing that we haven't even actually launched it yet. People are just finding it. I'm gonna post it on my story, get people to tell people that we launched already and you'll be like, you're getting a first early look or early chance to buy it. So we just launched the fragrances. They actually not launched yet technically because it's Friday night, the 15th, and we're launching it on the 16th. Typically what we do, this is an insider secret. No one knows about this, but we say we're launching a product on Saturday morning, and what we do is we actually launch the products on the website Friday afternoon, Friday evening, to test out purchases as they trickle in slowly. So because people don't know that we launch on Fridays, it's just a few people who are browsing the website and they see it and they're like, oh my God, wait, the product is live, Should I just buy it now and they buy it ahead of everyone else? And that lets us know, hey, okay, everything is working properly, the landing pages are good, the checkout process is looking pretty good, and it prevents any problems for us to work on over the weekend. So this is what the landing page for the Friggin's Collection looks like right now. It's looking really clean, really good. I personally go through all of this material, the copy, the photos, everything just to make sure it's all looking good. There's no, nothing misspelled or anything like that. I know it sounds weird for the founder of the company to be doing that, but I'm just super hands-on when it comes to how the brand is being presented. So I like to look at everything. All of this took so much work, so much effort from me and the team, so it's really good to see it live. And it's super exciting. It's about 6 p.m. on the dot now. I actually have a call at 6, so I'm gonna take that. And while I'm on the call, we have Rodrigo here, Still working, still working hard. How's it going? What are you working on? Working on the unboxing YouTube video. So Alex needs to post on launch days to help promote the product and remind people that we're dropping a product. So we're doing an unboxing video for Vertical and Horizontal, so Horizontal will go on YouTube and then Vertical will go on his Instagram and TikTok. How's it looking? We're like 95% done. It's looking pretty good. All right, I'm excited to finish it up. Almost there. Let us catch you up really quick. So we got some macro stuff and we have some micro stuff. So we got to switch the LLC to Texas before it would be here. If you're paid with that, right now it's still California. That's definitely good. Yep, so I'll coordinate that with you. And then number two is we should probably inject a little bit of capital. Like I mentioned earlier, just to be safe. I can cover that with you and try it as well. Yeah. Huge amount of that, just kind of get it over the hump. Yeah, sounds good. So we're getting invited by the Jets to come watch a match between the clothes and Jets. This is only my third football game ever, so I'm pretty excited. And it's at MadLife Stadium. We got a suite, which is really nice, has food, drinks, great seats in door-out, door area. And hopefully the Jets win. Got a breakfast pizza, that's a thing here. Chicken tenders, chicken wings, shredded chicken, spinach, and then of course now the stay. A lot of food. And the beer, you gotta have a beer when it comes to football games. Let's go! Let's go, finally. Finally."

        "transcript": " When you think of real style icons like Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, James Bond, David Beckham, there's something they all share. It's an effortless look that's never too loud, never trying too hard. And their style has lasted decades, not because it was trendy, but because it was built on masculinity, simplicity, confidence. When I first started exploring fashion, I'll be the first to admit I bought into hype. I followed trends that seemed cool at the time, and I even posted videos of those outfits here on YouTube so I could forever be embarrassed by those decisions. But thankfully over the years, I realized something. The outfits that I felt best in weren't the ones chasing trends, they were the timeless ones, the sharp suits, the classic coats, the loafers that get better with age. That's the style that I wanna help you build today. A mature, masculine look that doesn't just look amazing now, but is going to stand the test of time so that you can wear these pieces forever. So let's start with the core of every wardrobe, the essentials. This is where quality really matters because these are the items that you're gonna be reaching for almost daily. I'm talking about long sleeve and short sleeve polos, dress shirts, quality t-shirts, linen shirts, sweaters. These basics might seem simple, right? But they're the building blocks of a classic look. Let's start with polos and dress shirts. Look at style icons like JFK. And whether he's in a simple polo or a white dress shirt, he always looked really well put together. You don't need logos, you don't need flashy designs. Go for clean, solid colors and high quality materials like cotton or merino wool. Costs and suit supply make great polos that feel incredible in age well. Sweaters and cardigans. These are the kind of items that get better with age. Think about Steve McQueen in a classic cable knit sweater. Actually ended up buying the same sweater because I love it. It's a strong look that's masculine, refined. Look for fabrics like cashmere, Merino wool. Brands like Todd Snyder and Reese. Like they make great options in muted colors like navy, gray, tan. that are gonna look really great on you, regardless of when you're wearing it, whether it's this year, next year, or many years to come. And good examples are Paul Newman's classic look with a crew neck sweater over a dress shirt. It just shows how versatile and timeless these pieces can be. And the talented Mr. Ripley Jude Laws character shows off that relaxed elegance with crisp linen shirts and quality basics. And he looks amazing. Next up is outerwear, which is probably the most defining part of your wardrobe, right? A stylish coat or a jacket. It has the power to completely elevate your look because it takes up most of the real estate, right? It's the most visible part of your outfit. So for colder months, invest in a wool coat like the ones that you see in Peaky Blinders, for example, right? Tommy Shelby's wool overcoat adds that strong timeless touch to his look. Daniel Craig in Skyfall, he wears that pea coat, which is simple, but it's all about the fit and the clean lines. You can also go for a bomber jacket like Ryan Gosling in Drive. It's rugged, it has that masculine appeal to it. and bomber jackets, they've been around since 1917. They're still stylish to this day, so they're not going anywhere. You can invest in a nice one today and wear it until it literally just disintegrates. Onto leather jackets. Now, there's a reason why leather jackets have been worn by everyone from James Dean to Elvis Presley, right? A leather jacket is the ultimate masculine piece. It adds edge, style, character. I just got some full grain leather jackets from the jacket maker. They're handmade, so you can notice quality of the construction, the stitching, the YKK zippers. Shout out to them for sponsoring today's video. I'll promote these guys any day because it's hard to find quality things nowadays. There's that saying, oh they don't make them like they used to, right? It doesn't work for these jackets. They're handmade like the good old times. I got this absolutely beautiful brown leather bomber jacket from them and I mean it doesn't get more masculine and more elegant than that. It's the perfect piece for fall weather here in New York City. The color has this really nice detail. It makes the jacket look a lot more expensive than it really is and the brown leather is just top notch. Now if you prefer black, they got you covered. I have this sheepskin leather jacket. I got it in a size large by the way and it was a perfect fit. I'm 170 pounds and five nine. But if you're worrying about sizing, they have a made to measure service. So you can send them your measurements and they will make that jacket just for your measurements and it will fit you perfectly. And it's only $50 extra to get that service, which is a crazy good deal. Oh, and if you're worried about the quality or buying these things online, don't be because they have thousands of positive reviews. They've been doing this for years. It's a great gift for yourself or for someone special since the holidays are coming up, which is crazy to think about, but they're pretty much here. I can't even believe it, but this is the end of 2024 already, time's flying. And I know their pricing is already fair, but since you're a part of the YouTube family here, you get an additional 10% off your order by using the code Alex10. I'm gonna leave the link in the description below. But of course, no wardrobe is complete without a suit that fits you really well. A good suit doesn't need to be trendy. As a matter of fact, I actually think suits shouldn't be trendy. They need to fit well, they need to look timeless. Think of James Bond, whether it's Sean Connery or Daniel Craig, every Bond has worn a suit that shows that perfect tailoring. None of the muscle fit the horrible styles that we see today, right? They do that by sticking to solid colors like navy, charcoal, black, and making sure that the suit drapes well as opposed to pulling everywhere like you see it here. This is what suits look like nowadays. This is crazy. This looks horrible, right? We want masculinity. We want that simplicity. That's what makes the suit timeless. Not the muscle fit, not the skinny trousers. And brands like Suit Supply, Todd Snyder, they have amazing off the rack options that can be tailored to give you that custom feel. Remember, it's not about the flashy patterns. It's about the cut. It's about the fit. It's about how the suit makes you feel. Every man should have at least one great suit that he can rely on. Whether you're going for a work interview, you're going to a wedding, you're going to a formal event, you need that suit that fits you really, really well. Harvey Spector from Suits is a perfect example of a man who uses suits as his armor. Every suit he wears is impeccably tailored, understated, right? It commands respect. And of course, in the movie, in the series, Kingsman, Colin Firth's character is the embodiment of pure class. And his suits play a huge role in projecting that image of elegance, right? Now, one of the most important things that you need to keep in mind when it comes to achieving this classic mature style is that high quality fabrics will always be a good investment. Wool, leather, cotton, these are essentials. They feel great, they look great, and when you take care of them, they're gonna last a long time. And there's even research behind it. I mean, listen to this. Studies show that people perceive men wearing higher quality fabrics as more professional and more reliable. So when you invest in these fabrics, investing in items that will stand up to the test of time and develop character with each wear. So think about adding wool, cashmere sweaters, leather boots, knit polos, all of those items to your lineup. For example, I just finally watching Succession for the first time. I know, I'm very late to the game. But Kendall Roy, his choice of materials is subtle but powerful. Right? Wool coats, cotton shirts, leather accessories, it's all muted, it's all just commanding respect. Steve McQueen has that rugged leather jacket, right that became iconic because it's simple, it's well made, it fit him perfectly. He didn't need embellishments. The quality spoke for itself.

We have a ton of new content coming out, new vlogs, and I'm so excited to keep shooting for you guys, even after 14 years of being here on YouTube. But how about accessories? Should men wear accessories? Is that a masculine thing to do? Look, the truth is, accessories can make or break a look. When it comes to building a classic masculine wardrobe, keeping accessories to a minimum, keeping them simple and functional, that's the way to go. A well-made leather belt, a classic watch, quality sunglasses, that's all you need. Just look at James Bond's Omega watch, for example. It's understated, but it's absolutely timeless. It's one of my favorite pieces. I have the 007 No Time to Die C-Master and it's one of my favorite pieces. I love it. For sunglasses, I recommend Persols. and of course you can't go wrong with classic Ray-Ban wafers. For wallets, honestly I like to splurge because it's something that I carry with me every single day. I like this one from Cartier, but I also switched to this card holder from Tom Ford whenever I want something slim. I always recommend a nice wallet, ideally a card holder or pocket organizer because they're smaller, so you can fit them into your pocket, into your suits, right? You're gonna be reaching for this every day and people do notice these details, so it's okay to save, wait, and then spend more to get a quality wallet versus just buying the fast fashion wallets that look like crap and they're just gonna fall apart the moment you start wearing them. You guys probably know Patrick Bateman, right? He's the picture perfect poster boy of the business world. Maybe a little crazy. But he wears all of her people's glasses, for example. Tommy Shelby, he has this cap, right, and his pocket watch. So yeah, men can definitely wear accessories. I would say a watch, glasses, your everyday carry items like wallet, key chain, right? That's kind of it. There was a time I used to wear a lot of rings. I barely do any more. I wear this Cartier bracelet right here. It's simple, it's elegant, I wear it every day. And once in a while, you're gonna catch me wearing a necklace depending on the style that I'm going for, but besides that, I try to keep it simple. Simplicity always wins. But of course, none of that is gonna look good without knowing which colors to wear. The beauty of a mature masculine style is that it doesn't need loud colors or patterns to make a good impression. Neutrals like navy, gray, brown, they're versatile, they're sophisticated, they create a polished, clean look and they're also really easy to mix and match with the rest of your wardrobe. So you don't have to overcomplicate things. It's basically the whole point of this video. You can keep it pretty simple and you can look great, even better than if you were complicating things and if you were adding crazy designs and crazy brand names and logos. And research actually shows that neutral colors are often associated with dependability, maturity. They give off a vibe that's confident, assured, which is exactly what you want. Start with these neutral colors for your main pieces and then add variety by changing texture, changing materials. For example, in Mad Men, Don Draper's wardrobe is a masterclass in using neutrals to convey power and control. You're never gonna seem wearing anything flashy and that's the point. Thomas Shelby's wardrobe with PK Blinders is a lesson in dark muted colors, right? They emphasize his strength, his resilience And remember that true style is about confidence and its simplicity, not flashes. It's about finding what feels right for you and building on it. And when you invest in simple quality and timeless pieces, you're not just buying clothes. You're investing in a look that can potentially last a lifetime. So ditch the trends, focus on the essentials, and build a wardrobe that reflects the best version of you. I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " If you just started following my content, you might look at my social media today and think that I come from money or that I've never struggled, but life wasn't always easy for me. My family moved to the United States when I was 13 years old. The five of us shared one bedroom in my uncle's two bedroom apartment for a while before we were able to move into our own place. My dad was a dishwasher. My mom worked at the school cafeteria. And the fact that I got to where I am today, sometimes I can't even believe it myself. Even in my 20s, I was barely getting by. I was working three jobs. In the morning I would drive a six wheeler truck, all right, to deliver landscaping materials to make rich people's yards look better. I was a server at the Outback Steakhouse at night. In a few nights a week, I was a bouncer at a local nightclub to make some extra cash. Now all of that while taking classes to become an EMT, and at the time I had just started posting videos on YouTube. I had rent to pay, student loans, bills to worry about, and I would look at my bank account and feel this constant frustration. Like no matter how hard I worked, I mean, I had three jobs. I just couldn't get ahead and let's be real. I know a lot of you watching this video have been there or maybe you're there right now. You know, I realized something though. It wasn't just about how much money I made, how many jobs I had. It was about the habits that I had with my money and growing up in a household that didn't make a lot of money, I didn't learn good financial habits until much later in my life. I was stuck in a poor mindset, a low income mentality that keeps so many people prisoners to their circumstances. Now, if you feel that you're constantly broke, even when you're working hard like I was. This video is gonna break down the eight habits that are keeping you stuck. And these habits, they cost me years of financial growth. If you pay attention and if you make these adjustments, this can be the moment that changes everything for you, your entire life. So stick with me here. Let's start with the first habit that keeps so many people stuck, never talking about money. See, growing up, money wasn't really a topic, a conversation in my household because we just didn't have any. And maybe it's the same for you. In fact, it almost seemed rude or inappropriate to bring it up, but here's the problem. If you're not talking about money, you're not learning about it. And without that knowledge, without that exchange of information, it's easy to end up making mistakes, overspending, or missing out on opportunities to grow your wealth. I mean, listen to this, in a survey by Wells Fargo, 44% of Americans said that personal finance is the hardest topic to discuss with others. That's almost half of the people, right? They feel uncomfortable talking about something that impacts every single area of their lives, something that everyone has to go through, something that everyone needs. The reality is talking about money is one of the best ways to learn about managing it. The more you talk about it, the more you realize there are strategies, tips, insights that can help you get ahead, right? Think about it, how many times have you been in a conversation where someone casually talked about stocks, real estate, business ideas? Just by being around those people who talk about money, you pick up knowledge that you would never get otherwise. When I first started meeting people who were investing or building businesses, I realized how much there was to learn. And honestly, it gave me a push to be better with my own finances. If you wanna break out of this habit, start by finding people who are open to talking about money. This could be friends, mentors, or even online communities focused on personal finance. Get comfortable talking about money, asking questions, even if they seem basic. You'd be surprised at how much you can learn just by listening, just by asking questions. The more you talk about money, more confident and capable you're going to become with managing it, which brings us to habit number two. This second habit can keep you from reaching your potential, right? And it's not surrounding yourself with people who inspire you. Your environment has a massive impact on your mindset and the actions that you take. There's a saying that you might have heard, you're the average of the five people that you spend the most time with. It's absolutely true. If you're around people who don't have goals, we don't save, we don't talk about growth or money. It's easy to get stuck in the same place as they are. When I was just starting out, I actively sought out people who were successful, who were ambitious. Those were people who excited me, who I was like, okay, I need to talk to this person. He's really smart with his money. He's got this crazy investment idea, or he's got this crazy business. Like, I want to learn. How is he doing that? Right? These are the people who talk about business, who talk about financial goals, who talk about self-improvement. And let me tell you, being around them had a huge, massive impact on me. Studies even show that your behaviors, your decisions are influenced by your social circle. So a Harvard study actually found that people are 57% more likely to work towards their goals if they're around others with similar aspirations. It's important to find people who are on the same journey as you or even better, right? People who are a few steps ahead. I mean, look at those who are investing, starting businesses, focusing on self-improvement. When you're around people like that, you naturally start picking up their habits, their mindset, their drive. This isn't about abandoning your current friends, by the way, But it's about consciously creating a support system that pushes you to be better, to learn new things. And if you can't find those people in real life, start online. Join finance or business groups. Find forums, connect with people on social media who are where you wanna be. Surround yourself with people who inspire you, doesn't just motivate you, it normalizes success. And then suddenly achieving financial freedom doesn't feel like a pipe dream, doesn't feel like something that you've never even heard of, and that is unreal. It feels like something that's totally within your reach because you know people who have achieved that goal and they can give you the map The guidelines to achieve that let's talk about bad habit number three that might be keeping you poor living above your means That's one of the most common traps and it's easy to fall into because society almost encourages right everywhere you look There's an ad telling you to buy a new car upgrade your phone splurge on some luxury item But if you're spending more than you're making or even just breaking even every month, you're setting yourself up for failure This is especially dangerous when you're using credit cards to cover your lifestyle because they have a huge interest rate I'm not sure if you've heard of this rule, but this is gonna change your life. It's the 50 30 20 rule This is a really good framework to avoid falling into this trap and according to this rule 50% of your income should go to your essentials 30% to your wants and 20% to savings or debt payments Following this rule helps keep your expenses in check so that you don't end up living paycheck to paycheck check, right? So many people overspend on housing, on cars, on dining out, and then it leaves them financially strapped. Did you know that over 40% of Americans couldn't cover $400 emergency without borrowing or selling something? $400. Living within your means doesn't mean you can't enjoy life, by the way. It just means making smarter choices. Maybe you don't need the newest car model, right? You don't need the fanciest apartment right now. It sounds nice, right? But maybe wait a little bit longer. Find ways to cut down your unnecessary expenses so that you can save money for the future. When I was building my career, I made a lot of sacrifices to save money to get to where I am today, to have the apartment that I have today. I wasn't going out as much, I drove an older car, I kept my expenses low. Think about it this way, every dollar you save now is a dollar you can invest or use to build something bigger in the future. Cutting back on spending isn't about deprivation, right? It's about setting yourself up for freedom, for flexibility down the road, think about future you. He deserves that, right? By living within your means today, you're giving your future self way more options and way less stress. Now, this next habit is a costly one and that's delaying investing. Too many people think that they're gonna start investing someday, maybe that's you, right? Oh, someday I'm gonna start investing. But then that day keeps just getting pushed back, right? Every day, like, I'll just do it next month. This is a tough month for me. You know, I'll just do it next year. I'm gonna take this year to just spend on some cool things. You know, I just turned 20. I wanna go out and enjoy it with my friends. This is where the saying time is money really applies because compound interest is incredibly powerful, right? And this is one of the biggest, biggest advantages of starting early. Here's a quick example, I'm gonna show you, right? It's really powerful. If you're starting investing $200 a month at age 25, right? It's not even that young, 25, $200 a month and earn a 7% annual return, which isn't crazy, all right? you're gonna have about $280,000 by the time you're 65, only $200 a month. But if you wait until the age 35 to start, you're gonna need to invest $400 a month to reach the same amount. That's double the effort just because you waited 10 years. Now imagine if you invest $225 and then at 30, you start to invest $500, right? It goes on and on. I mean, starting early allows your money to grow with way less effort on your part. And seeing that bank account grow, it changes your mindset because now you look at it and you think, you know what? This is, there's some abundance happening here. I'm doing well. I'm gonna pick up steam and I'm gonna keep it going. It makes you feel good. Albert Einstein actually called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. If you understand it, you earn it. And if you don't, you pay it. Small amounts invested early can lead to huge growth over time. You don't even need a lot to start investing. Thanks to apps. Look, most people don't invest because they get overwhelmed with the amount of information that's out there. They don't know where to start. I get that, right? But here's the problem. What are you waiting for? It's not gonna change, right? You still have to figure it out at some point. And as you can see from the compound interest here, the sooner the better. A good way to start is by leveraging professional help as opposed to just doing it yourself. If you don't know how to invest yet, our sponsor today, Titan, specializes in that. Studies show that on average, investors with advisors tend to outperform those who do it themselves, which makes total sense, right? A professional is gonna be better than you, no doubt. And Titan gives you a similar approach to those high net worth individuals and how they manage their finances. It's like having a personal advisor in your pocket at all times and they're real humans helping you as opposed to just algorithms or computers. Now, look, I'm always gonna keep you real with you guys who watch my videos. I'm not a financial advisor. There are of course always risks when you're investing your money. And I've had my fair share of ups and downs as I started to understand this financial world. I've made mistakes along the way. This $65,000 photo of a monkey being one of the biggest ones. So do your own research, take some time to look into Titan and what they do. They're legit, the company is registered with the SEC and is reputable, but of course, with any investment, there's gonna be risks. As they say, no risk, no reward, right? But it's always good to be aware of that. Now, another cool perk of Titan is that when you become a member, you also get white glove concierge access to events. Think like American Express Platinum concierge, but from your wealth management team. So they have a suite at Madison Square Garden. They give you access to sold out events, hard to get reservations, et cetera. It's a really good place to start, especially if you haven't invested yet, or if you just don't know how to do it yourself, I'm gonna leave the link to tighten in the description below. And one more thing, don't wait for the perfect moment or think that you need a big paycheck to start investing. Right, because a lot of people do that. Every day you delay, you're giving up on future growth. Take today and just put 15 bucks, 20 bucks, 100, whatever you got, man, whether it's in stocks, real estate, a retirement account, make it a habit to put money towards your future. It's an investment in the freedom that you're gonna have down the road. This next habit might seem small, but it's one of the most powerful changes that you can make. You need to start keeping track of your finances. A lot of people avoid looking at their bank accounts because it's uncomfortable, right? They might look at their bank. Where's my phone? Lost it, here we go. They might look at their bank account and be like, oh my God, this is not looking good. And then tomorrow they're like, I don't wanna feel that again. I'm not even gonna look, right? But the thing is, if you don't know where your money is going, you can't improve. Ignoring it doesn't make the problem go away. It's gonna make it worse. It's always gonna be on your phone whether you look at it or not, right? That's just the reality. In a study by the National Endowment for Financial Education, found that people who track their spending are more likely to be in control of their finances and make better financial decisions, which is again, no duh. Like of course, people are gonna make better financial decisions if they look at their bank accounts every day and if they know their finances from A to Z. Simply checking in on your accounts regularly, looking at your income versus expenses, that can be eye-opening. You might realize you're spending way too much on things like takeout or TV subscriptions, right? Just take a look, see where your money is going. When you start tracking, you get a clear picture of your habits. Maybe you're spending $200 a month on coffee or eating out, which adds up to thousands over the year. Once you see it, you can decide if it's worth it or if that money could go towards savings or investments. Tracking lets you take control, and that control is what leads to financial growth. Don't make the same mistake of thinking that tracking your finances is depressing or frustrating. Instead, think of it as empowering. You're getting a handle on the situation, right? You're making choices that move you towards your goals. Make it a habit to check weekly or even monthly. The more you do it, the less intimidating it's going to get. It's just going to be normal everyday operations, right? It's going to be a part of your life, a part of your routine.

So if that sounds good, hit that subscribe button below. All right, another habit that can hold you back financially is relying on just one stream of income. If all your money is coming from one single paycheck, you're in a vulnerable position, right? What happens if you lose that job? What happens if your hours get cut? Having just one source of income, used to be okay way back in the day, but nowadays it puts you at risk. And it's hard to build wealth when you're just constantly worried about job security. So diversifying your income can give you better peace of mind. It's gonna teach you new skills and give you financial stability. So even if one source drops, you're not left stranded, right? Financial expert even emphasize the importance of multiple income streams. And with good reason, it doesn't mean that you need to start a bunch of businesses and be this crazy entrepreneur all at once. It can be as simple as starting a side hustle. Freelancing, investing in a rental property, right? Or finding small ways to earn income. For example, in my 20s, I didn't limit myself to just one job because I knew that each job was helping me get closer to my goals. And I mean, I was getting paid absolute shit, right? I'm talking about the outbacked takeouts. I'm talking about delivering landscaping materials like stones and mulch, all right? I wasn't getting paid a lot of money. I was driving trucks. I was bouncing at a nightclub for cash under the table. all while going to school and building my YouTube channel. It was exhausting. But in the long run, those sacrifices were worth it, right? Each job helped me contribute it to my savings, to my investments, and ultimately to the financial freedom that I have today. Think about it this way. Every additional stream of income is another layer of security and opportunity. If you're serious about financial independence, don't rely on just one paycheck. Start small if you need to, then make a commitment to build multiple sources over time. And I'm gonna give you one last tip when it comes to having another source of income, because people think I need to create a new business. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about go pick up some shifts, doing something that you might seem like, it's too low for me, I don't really wanna do that, I'm above that, it doesn't matter. If you're making $100 a night as a server and you work three nights a week, just to get some extra money, you're making an extra $300 a week and if you do that a month, that's 1200 bucks a month, right? That's not bad. That is not bad for an extra three nights a week of just picking up some shifts at a restaurant. Is it the dream job that you want? I'm assuming it's not, but $1,200 a month is gonna help you. It's not nothing. So stop looking at these social media posts that are telling you that if you're not making $10,000 a month with online dropshipping, you're missing out by my course, go pick up some shifts and make real money instead of these get rich quick schemes that are not gonna lead you anywhere. They're just gonna take your money and you're not gonna make anything back. This next bad habit is not tracking your net worth. Look, I know tracking your net worth might sound like something that only millionaires and billionaires, your finance gurus do, right? But honestly, it's one of the most empowering things that you can do for your finances because your net worth is basically just everything that you own, your assets, right? Minus everything that you owe, your liabilities and tracking this, even if you're just starting out. It helps you see the bigger picture of your financial health, right? It's a habit that can shift your focus from just income to overall wealth. How much of my worth? How can I grow my net worth? Well, I gotta lower my expenses. I got to increase my income and there we go. We're getting somewhere, right? It makes it, it actually sounds complicated, but it simplifies things so much. When I started tracking my net worth, I realized that it's not just about how much money I was making every month, it's about how much I was building over time, right? You might have heard what gets measured, gets managed, and that's so true. Knowing your net worth keeps you aware of your progress, right? It shows you where you're going. It's like, if you're a YouTuber or you're growing your Instagram, is you're just seeing those followers grow. Why don't you do that with your money to know how much you're actually worth? That's way better than followers, right? Whether your net worth is $500 or $500,000, tracking it helps you set those clear financial goals. For example, if you're carrying a lot of debt, you're gonna notice that it's really impacting your net worth negatively, right? It's bringing you down because you have all of those debts. Those are all liabilities. Now, seeing it in black and white can push you to be like, okay, I need to stop spending as much, right? I need to tackle this debt aggressively. Or if you have savings and investments, when you're tracking it, it helps you celebrate that growth, right? It gives you that. It invigorates you because you're like, oh, okay, things are looking up here. Let's keep it going. Let me put a little bit more money into this investment account. Getting to the habit of calculating your net worth might feel tedious or too much for you right now, but trust me, it's eye-opening. I'll tell you how to do it. It's very easy. You just start by listing everything you own from cash in your bank accounts, cash in your pocket and your safe, whatever you got, right? Your investments, your properties, savings, add all of that up. and then subtract what you owe like credit card balances, student loans, car loans, any other debt. Now, do this every month, right? And as you see your net worth grow, you're gonna feel motivated to keep going and building a stronger financial future. Now, this final habit I wanna talk about is something that a lot of people do and it's a huge mistake, all right? Spending on once before saving or investing. Now, this is a trap that a lot of people fall into, especially with social media constantly showing us what everyone else is buying, what everyone else is doing, go on to this concert, go on to this trip, right? It's easy to spend first telling yourself, oh, I'm gonna save what's left at the end of the month. But then, at the end of the month, there's nothing to save. Financial advisors have a really good name for it, and I think when you understand this name, when you hear it, it's gonna make sense, and it's gonna make you want to do it. And that is paying yourself first, which means setting aside money for savings and investments before you go do anything else. If you get a paycheck, the first thing you should do is pay any bills, pay any debt, put aside at least 20% for savings or investment. If you're carrying, of course, high interest debt, tackle that aggressively, right? For example, like credit card debt, you'd have to pay those off because every dollar paid off is money that you save on interest. And then whatever's left can go towards your wants, but only after you've taken care of your debt, and then of course, your savings. And I get it, it's so tempting, right? To spend money on experiences because I'm in my 20s, I just wanna experience life, I just wanna have a good life. I understand it feels good right now, but just delay that gratification a little bit longer. Imagine instead of doing that, you consistently invested a portion of your income over time that money grows. And soon enough, you have the flexibility to enjoy life without having to worry about your finances. Even a small amount invested monthly can grow into a substantial amount over the years. Thanks to compound interest. What I'm getting at here is that sacrificing today means way more freedom and a better life tomorrow. So the next time you get paid, try this immediately allocate money towards your goals, right? Pay yourself first, whether it's savings, debt reduction, investments, after that, if there's money left over for wants, then enjoy it. Guilt free, guilt free. You don't have to think about it. It's like, this is, I already took care of myself. This is just my wants, right? And developing this habit is gonna have a huge impact on your financial stability. And ultimately it's gonna set you on the right path to wealth. So my advice to you is right now, to start by tackling one or two of these habits, right? start tracking your finances, or maybe start talking about money with your family, get comfortable talking about money, right? And focus on building these habits that create long-term growth, stability, freedom. You have the power to shift from simply getting by to truly building wealth. And it all starts with the choices that you make right now."

        "transcript": " I have a ton of fragrances. You guys have seen my fragrance collection, but the fragrances in here are extra special to me. These are my first ever fragrances for my brand Forte series. They took three years to develop and they're finally here. This is the first batch of them. And I'm gonna be unboxing them, talking to you about the notes, when to wear them, how the fragrances are different from each other. And I'm gonna answer any of your questions in the comments below. So feel free to ask any questions away. Let's get this started. I'm excited to see this. I've been waiting so long for this moment. This is the Frigga's collection from Forte series. And we have two fragrances, Protagonist EDP and Antagonist EDP. Not only that, we're also launching an atomizer so that you can take your fragrance with you on the go. Now I'm gonna open these right here. I'm stoked. Let me show you the packaging. First and foremost, they both have the same box with just the different names and of course, different descriptions when you look at it in the back, talking about the scent. Let me open Protagonist first. And let me just start by saying that Protagonist wasn't just a fragrance that we decided to make out of thin air. This was actually requested by our customers, by my followers, because it's the same scent or at least a variation of the scent from the Argan oil, from the hair clay, from the sea salt spray, all the Forty-C's products that have our signature scent and you guys requested a fragrance out of it, that was what sparked this whole thing and we decided to make Protagonist. But of course, we had to switch things up a little bit and make it more of a fragrance and less of a hair product scent. So you're still gonna be able to smell that DNA. It's very much the Forte signature fragrance, but now it's protagonist. It's a little bit different. Let me read to you what we wrote here in the back, the story of protagonist. Step into the spotlight and become the main character with protagonist EDP by Forte series. Your hero journey begins with top notes of Bergamot, Cardamon, setting the stage for an unforgettable adventure. As the story unfolds, It reveals sophisticated notes of orange flower and geranium, adding depth to your character. The grand finale is a luxurious blend of warm vanilla and rich amberwood, completing your hero narrative. Protagonist ADP is more than a fragrance. It's an experience that embodies elegance, ambition, and undeniable attraction. Own your narrative and empower your inner hero with every spray. Now, the whole point of us calling you a protagonist is to really just show you that you can be the hero of your own journey, you can be the hero of your life, that you can write your personal story. And this is my story, this is based on my story. When I grew up in Brazil, when I moved to the U.S. as an immigrant and my dad was a dishwasher, and my mom was working at my school cafeteria, and we had nothing to our names. I felt like I needed to step up and become the hero of my household. That was my journey. And I wanted to embody that as much as possible with protagonist. Let me open it for the very first time. There it is. The first ever bottle of Protagonist IDP. It's nice and snug in there. We did what we could with the packaging to make sure that it was really safe because obviously these are gonna be shipped. So we put a really high pressure foam in there. It's nice and thick. It's not gonna break. All the little details, you know, like the chrome foil that we put all around the packaging, the box here. This is the bottle of Protagonist. The bottle is fluted. You can't tell from your screen, but this boy is heavy. I got so many bottles to test out and see which way I wanted to go with the packaging and I felt this one and it just felt right. It was expensive to make in terms of packaging, but we wanted it to feel premium. We wanted you to, every time you spray this, to feel like that hero, to feel like the protagonist and to step into that spotlight. Also, little details like the cap. So we went with a heavy cap that just felt right, but simple, clean, elegant. Hey, the very first spray of Protagonist. Man, I'm so happy with how this came out. And looking at this, we nailed the packaging, we nailed the scent. It smells really, really good. So if I had to describe the scent, it's definitely an all season scent. It's sexy and it's intriguing. Like it just kind of pulls you in, right? It's a fresh scent, so you can definitely smell it in the summer. Now, that's protagonist, very excited for this. Then you of course show you. Antagonist was born because I wanted to do something for my guys who are more well versed in fragrances, slightly maybe older. I don't want to generalize, but this is definitely a more mature scent. So I want to be upfront with you guys. I want to make sure that if you're buying this fragrance, you're buying it for the right reasons and you're getting the right one. Antagonist is definitely very different from protagonist. They have the same base notes, Cardamom and Petruly, but this is a smokey patchouli. So let me read to you the antagonist box. Good guys, they play it safe. Antagonist EDP by Forte Series is for those who dare to be powerful and unpredictable. Your origin story begins with notes of Bergamot, Cardamom, Crisp Apple, and Passion Fruit Nectar, creating a deceptively playful opening. Then, notes of Saffron, Bulgarian Rose, and Violet Leaf add complexity to your character. Finally, classic traits of the antagonist emerge. A dark seductive fusion of benzoing, sandalwood, oud and smoky patchouli completes your nemesis narrative. Antagonist CDP is more than a fragrance, it's a statement of power, attraction and mystery. Own your narrative and step into your dark nature with each spray. Here goes the very first spray of antagonist. It's just so, it's complex. It's not a mass appealing scent. I'll tell you that right now. It's got oud, it's got that cardamom patruly base that we get from Protagonist, but then it takes a dark, smoky turn. But there's a hint of passion fruit there that just rounds it up so nicely. But it's definitely not for a tea danger. It's definitely not for the kid who's gonna wear this to high school, right? This is like, when you're up to no good, when you dare to be different, when you want to go out and you just want to attract, That's what this scent is for. These are great, great scents, and they complement each other really, really well. Even though they have the same base notes, they take a very different approach towards the end. The cool thing about this is that, of course, you can buy them separately. You can also buy them together. And when you buy them together, you get a special discounted forte series. Not only that, when you buy them together, when you buy the kit, you get our travel atomizer. And I love this travel atomizer. I've been using it for all of my trips. I've been traveling a lot over the summer, and we've had this ready for about four months now. which is very exciting. This is how it comes. You can see that it's got this really beautiful leather texture to it, chrome finishings. It's really easy to fill it up. All you have to do is just pump it and it's gonna keep filling it and filling it until you have five milliliters to take another go. Then you slide it back into the atomizer, close the cap, just like that. You can take it on the go. You can take it to a party if you wanna re-up on the fragrance. You can leave it in your car. If you're going somewhere, you wanna spray it before you get somewhere. You can take it to you when you're going to work. you can obviously take it to you when you're traveling. And speaking of traveling, these fragrances are 100 ml or 3.4 ounces, which is the limit that you can take with you on inside your carry-on, which is great. Something that I didn't talk about is the longevity. So with both of these fragrances, we went so far as testing out different oil percentages for both of these fragrances to see what oil concentration worked best for projection, so how far people can smell you, and longevity, how long the scent's gonna last on your skin. And we ended up doing a very high percentage for each of these. Protagonist has 18% of fragrance oil concentration and antagonist has 20% of fragrance oil concentration, which is the highest you can do for an EDP. Typically an EDP fragrance is gonna have about 15, 16, 17% oil concentration. So we wanted to up that and just bring you the best possible. It's funny because we actually tried all the way up to like 24% of oil concentration. It just didn't perform as well. So we started dialing it down two by two until we found the perfect oil concentration for both of the fragrances. And if you're just starting your fragrance collection now, this is such a great way to start. This is a really great entry point because you have protagonist, which is sweet, attractive, but you can wear it year round in any time of the day. So you can go out on a date and wear this, you can wear it to work. It's an all around Swiss Army Knife of Sense that you can wear for anything. Now, antagonist, it's a little bit different. This one, I would say, is definitely more gear towards nighttime. It's more elegant, more mature. Like I said, it's got that smokiness to it. So I would wear this definitely on a date, but maybe not to work, for example, just because it's a little heavy. For sure, we made it powerful. This is the villain of the story. This is powerful. It's a great balance to have both of these fragrances. And I just wanted to take a second and thank you so much for the support over the past five years. When I launched Forte Series five years ago, I feel like I was just a kid. I feel like I was just getting started. I didn't really know what I was doing. I knew nothing about building brands. I knew nothing about e-commerce. and I was just trying to figure things out. And five years later, I feel like I got this down. This is the culmination of all of that work. We put so much effort into the packaging, the boxes, the scent, the marketing materials, all of it. And you guys are gonna see when you get the scent at home and you smell it, you're gonna see why we put so much work into it and why I love these fragrances so much. They're available right now as of today, November 16th. Get them both, get the discount and get the free atomizer. That's the way to go. Thank you guys so much for watching. Thank you so much for your support, and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " So there's a term that's been gaining a lot of traction lately. It's locking in. And you might have heard it. It's all about getting serious, focusing, shutting out distractions. Locking in is when you dial into what really matters and actually finish things. In 2017, I was sitting at my desk at Google and I was doing well by most people's standards. I had a great job, six figure pay, every benefit you can imagine. But all I could think about was quitting and working for myself, building something of my own. And I knew in my gut that if I wanted that to actually work, I'd have to go all in. So I locked in. I worked around the clock to the point where it felt like working for myself was the only option I had. I became obsessed. There was no going back, no maybe in my mind, and that was the first time I realized what locking in can do. When you cut out the distractions, when you focus, and when you just push forward. And that's exactly why I want to talk to you about this today, locking in because what it can do for you, it can be life changing. A few months of total focus can completely transform your life. Once you decide to lock in, the first thing you're going to notice is how quickly your mindset shifts. It's not just about working hard. It's about working smart, being relentless in your focus. And let me tell you, back in 2017 when I was still working at Google, I felt that change firsthand. I would wake up thinking about my YouTube channel and go to bed thinking about my next piece of content. All of a sudden my job at Google wasn't just a safety net anymore. It started feeling like this weight that I just needed to shed. I wanted to succeed. I really wanted to bet on myself. I knew that if I wanted to succeed, I couldn't just dip my toes in. I had to dive in head first. I had two goals in 2017. One was to grow my YouTube channel to 500,000 subscribers. And two, to feel good about quitting a job as good as Google, I needed to save some money. I needed to have a safety net in case things didn't work out. And what I did is, you know, I did some math. I came up with a number $80,000. I lived in LA LA is expensive, right? So I looked at that piece of paper for a while. It said 80 K on it and I got pretty nervous. I'm not going to lie. I was sweating. So I added another 20 on top to make around $100,000. That meant that I'd have to work really, really hard to save a hundred grand. I needed to stop spending money unless it was extremely necessary. I had to lock in. There's a lot of YouTube videos out there titled, I Locked Myself in a Room for Six Months, right? And of course, that's an exaggeration. No one is locking themselves in a room for six months and just sitting there in the dark, right? It just means you're actually gonna lock in for a while. You're not really gonna pay attention to the outside and come out a new person. Here's a wild stat for you. A study by the American Psychological Association found that consistent focus over a period of six months can improve your productivity by 25%. Imagine what being 25% more productive means to you, to your career, to your side hustle, to your personal goals. Six months of deep focus can put you so far ahead people won't be able to catch up. Now let's do a quick exercise together here. If you're just listening to this video in the background, I know some people do that, but I beg you, I'm going to ask you to focus on this for just a minute. I want you to imagine yourself living your ideal life, your dream life. You don't have to go crazy if you don't want to. It doesn't have to be private jets and yachts, right? Maybe your dream life is having an aesthetic physique that you're proud of making six figures a year, being happily married to your dream woman, living in your dream ocean front house or penthouse in the city. Imagine your ideal life. Now think of where you are today. Just acknowledge the truth and be honest. Do you have a great physique? Is your income enough to live a great life? Are you dating women that excite you? Are you happy with where you are in life today? And maybe you are. I'm going to tell you where I'm at. I have a good life. I have a lot of great things going on in my life. You've seen some of it on social media and I don't even show the best parts to be honest with you. I just try to keep that private. But even though I'm happy, I'm not satisfied. I want more. And not in an egotistical, greedy way. It's actually the opposite. I just want to know how far I can go. How far can an immigrant from Brazil who moved to the US at age 13 didn't speak English, mom working at the school cafeteria, dad working as a dishwasher, how far can I go? From working as a landscaper, working at Domino's Pizza, working as a server at Outback Steakhouse, just to pay my bills when I was in my 20s, to owning properties in Miami, Los Angeles, starting multiple businesses, I'm proud of that. But is there more in the tank? I think so. I owe it to myself, I owe it to my family who immigrated here, right, to give us the best chance possible. I owe it to see how far I can go. So I am locked in. I'm building my brand 40 series to become a 50 to 100 million dollar brand. I've been posting content online since 2011. That's 13 years without a single break. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. And as a matter of fact, I'm always thinking of ways to improve my content. And you can clearly see that if you go back to my old videos. I think they suck, right? I'm trying to get better with every video, with every upload, with every hair product. So let's get tactical here. How do you apply this? How do you actually lock in? And the hard part isn't even knowing what to do. I'm gonna give you the plan, the three things that you have to do to lock in, but the hard part is gonna be sticking with the plan. So in the end of this video, after I give you the three-step plan, I'm gonna give you the one thing that helps me keep going, that pushes me forward every day. And without this, I think I would have given up a long time ago. Now the first step is to define what locking in looks like for you. And it's a two step process. All right. First, you figure out your goal and second, you figure out what you have to do to achieve that goal. And I'm going to show you how to write that down exactly. So you have a clear vision of what locking in looks like for you specifically. Before I show you that, I'm sure you could see the watch that I've been wearing. This is the date 002 from Oro watches. Big shout out to them for sponsoring today's video. I wish you guys could feel how heavy this feels. All right. And this feels really nice on the wrist. It feels like a luxury timepiece, but of course without the luxury price tag. Now when I first started working with them, they only had a handful of options. Now they've expanded their whole collection and they have a ton of new watches with different metal options. You can go with brushed or polished steel and silver, rose gold, which is really clean. They also have them in black if you like that sleek look. This trap options are endless from steel bracelets to rubber straps and even leather, which just came out. I absolutely love watches. I think every man should wear a watch. You guys know that. I say that all the time. Women have their jewelry, you know, their earrings, their rings, necklaces, bracelets, so on and so forth. Men, we have our watches. You know, most of the time, that's our main accessory. I have a big watch collection. You've seen it here on YouTube, but of course those watches are pricey. I realize that most people can't afford those just yet. So this is a great alternative. It's at an attainable price tag that looks great and it feels like you spent a lot more. Every man needs a watch, and this is a high quality timepiece without the crazy price tag. It's clean, it has a minimalist fashion forward design that I personally love, and of course, I'm not gonna just let you pay full price. Aura is hooking you up with 40% off your entire order with no limits. You can buy one, two, 10 watches and straps, and get 40% off if you go to aura.watch.alixcostup. I'm gonna leave that link in the description below. Okay, back to the two things that you need to get locked in, your goal and how to achieve it. Now let's say your goal is to get a promotion at work. You're not just gonna wait for it to happen. You have to actively make it happen. First, you need to get crystal clear on what's expected for that next role. Look at the people who already hold that position. What do they do differently, right? You try to understand. What skills do they have that I don't have? What impact are they making? And write those things down because now your focus is to master each of those things. Then you need to go above and beyond. Locking in for this promotion means treating every day as if you're already in that role. Be proactive. Look for projects that need improvement. When your manager needs help, volunteer to lead those initiatives and become the person that adds value to every meeting. Don't just be present, add value. Show your boss that you're thinking one step ahead. There's a study by Harvard Business Review that found that employees that consistently go beyond their job description are 50% more likely to be promoted. That's a huge statistic. So now you know the goal is to get a promotion. And the way to get there is to be proactive and to go above and beyond. That's step one of locking in. Step two is to implement that into your daily life, into your routine. Because once you know exactly what you need to do to reach your goal, you just need to build it into your schedule, into your everyday life. And here's the thing, locking in, it doesn't work if it's just something that you intend to do. It needs to become a habit. It needs to become part of your day to day routine. It needs to be built in, woven into your life. So the most important thing you need to implement this into your routine is to learn time management. People think locking in is just about being on their computers all day. Look, time management is everything. I use Google Calendar for every single thing. This is what a typical Monday looks like for me. Pretty much every minute is accounted for. I don't have to think about what I have to do. It's already laid out for me. I already made that decision of what I'm gonna do on Monday A long time ago, now I just execute the plan. Google Calendar is your best friend if you're trying to lock in. Start using it as soon as possible, it's free. Because it's gonna change your life. I guarantee you're gonna be more productive if you create a calendar like this and you just have it open on your phone or your computer so you can keep track of your time and your tasks. And this is the oldest saying in the world, time doesn't stop, right? So when you're looking at that and time is going by, either you're getting things done or you're getting left behind. And it's purely on you. You created that schedule on Google Calendar, so you have to stick to it, or you're gonna feel horrible, or at least you should. Now in 2017, when I wanted to save those $100,000, which was a huge, huge goal for me, I had the craziest routine ever. I would wake up at 6 a.m., hit the gym, commute to the Google office, work until five or six, then drive home, work all night on my YouTube channel and Instagram page. I would shoot, edit, I'd watch tutorials on how to make thumbnails on Photoshop. On the weekends, I would shoot all of my Instagram photos for that week because I had no time to shoot them during the week and it was dark by the time I got home from work so I couldn't even shoot if I wanted to. I just had to lock in because I knew that if I failed, that meant that I should probably just keep my job at Google and give up on the dream. So it was all or nothing. That chapter of my life taught me so many lessons, but time management was by far the most important one. And a pro tip here is that I used to not be very good at knowing how long tasks would take me, I would assume that I could get something done in 30 minutes, but really I needed an hour to do it. And that would derail my whole day. So in the beginning, give yourself some grace. Give yourself some extra time to get things done. Then once you know how long these tasks take you, you just adjust those. So give yourself some grace in the beginning. Now step number three is to minimize distractions, which are all over, especially now that we have our phones and social media. Put yourself as the number one priority. It sounds selfish. Put yourself as number one. about other people. This is what it takes to get to the next level. You can't be locked in if your priorities are to drink with your friends, to travel, to binge watch Netflix. Understand that your priority is to succeed. To achieve that goal that you set out to achieve, the rest can wait. Sacrifices will be made. You might not see your friends as much. You might not have a lazy Sunday for a while. Who cares? If the goal that you wrote down is a good goal, a goal that you actually want, if it's gonna change your life for the better, Those sacrifices in the end should be worth it. By the way, locking in doesn't even mean that you're this robot, right? You're still human. Humans need breaks. But when you do rest, when you do take a break, do it intentionally. If you're gonna have a rest day, make it a day that recharges you. Hang out with your friends, go on a hike, do something that brings you excitement, joy. Don't let that break turn into two days, then three, then a week. That's where most people slip up. They let that one day off derail their entire plan. Locking in means getting right back into your routine the next day. Oh, and by the way, be ready for pushback. Your friends might say, come on, dude, just come out tonight, want a drink, that girl's coming, right? Or, oh, you're too stuck up now, you're too serious, just relax. And look, balance is important, but if you know that you have to work that day to achieve that goal that you set out to do, discipline is saying no to what you want now for what you want most later on. It's about those small daily decisions that add up. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, he trained seven days a week for five years, leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. No days off on Christmas, no day off on his birthday. That's the kind of discipline that leads to world records and one of the most incredible athletes of all time. Now, I'm not saying that's what you have to do. You don't have to go that extreme, but just think about what that kind of consistency can do for you. Walking in can make someone an Olympic champion. Imagine what six months can do for your business, for your personal goals, for your fitness. But there's one last thing. One thing that keeps me going every single day. The one thing that pushed Michael Phelps to be able to not miss a single day of training. And I'm gonna be honest with you, this thing is not even teachable. But I'm gonna try my best. When I wake up, it's like I'm going to battle, all right? If I don't do these things on my calendar, if I don't get them done, I'm not winning. I'm competing against myself. The one thing that keeps me going is this obsession with becoming better and better. Being obsessed with getting a promotion will get you the promotion. Being obsessed with being in the best shape of your life will bring you those results because if you're truly obsessed, I'm talking about true obsession here. If you're truly obsessed about something, it's hard to think about anything else. You think about it in the shower. You think about it in the car, in bed. You dream about it. And when that much thought goes into a specific goal, chances are you're going to make it happen. So here's my challenge to you. Forget the new year's resolution BS. Start early. For the next six months, lock in. Cut out what doesn't serve you. Stay consistent. Stay disciplined. And when you do, you're going to find that locking in isn't just a trendy term. It's a mindset shift that's going to change your life."

        "transcript": " Hey new beginnings on the cusp not too old to adjust old dog new tricks remember I was just a Pucks are dirty in my cup You think you're ready to vlog again It's been a while The last day of 740 I'm all packed already somehow I decided that but honestly I just have so much more to show this time Last time I blogged at a full-time job at Google and I was doing this on the side and I remember just having to come up with things to do on my off time to be able to show the vlog and now This is my full-time job. This is what I do We have a team. I'm not shooting everything and editing everything myself. We have the man behind the camera, Rodriguez. Let's go I'm ready. Let's do it I like just chatting. Yeah, I would never vlog. I can be pretty excited on the back and forth. Do you think they're gonna like it? I think so. I mean, been working on it for three years. I hope they like it. I like it. I like it. Now we're gonna go to Soho, ask people if they like it. Usually I hate people that come up to me, they come up to me and they try to put the camera on my face and ask me questions, you know, like, without your confidence. Now we're going to be those people. Now we're going to be those people. So the goal is to go to SoHo, ask them if they like the fragrance, ask them to rate it. We're going to ask girls and guys. I think it's just a great marketing strategy for us to use to show, because you know, when you're buying a fragrance online, you're kind of blind buying a scent and it's tough, right? because you don't get to smell it. So they buy it kind of trusting me. So my word is on the line, you know? And so I think this will help. We'll just show people real reactions when people actually think of the fragrance, and I think that'll help. And then we launch the thing very soon, in like two weeks. So it's happening. It's all happening. I think it's worth it. 0.5, what's this one? Like a 9.3. Would you wear it? Hell yeah. What do you think of a protagonist? That's a 8.5. 8.5, that's solid. Yeah, that's very good. I would wear it. I need a follow-up question. Is it gender neutral? Is it for men or for women? It's for men, but I mean. Okay, that's what I thought. I would wear it. Obviously women could wear it, but I'm assuming like you would be wearing it. Yes. Okay. What would you think about it, Mark? Okay, okay. I think like an eight. Eight? Yeah, I like it. finished we got five reactions maybe six reactions six reactions yeah and then I went like off-camera this couple they looked really cool they were very stylish and I asked them they're like can we please not be out camera but we'll review it for you and they both rated it really high so honestly I feel great like this weight has just come off my shoulders in my back because I mean obviously I want this to do well and I put so much work into it then I'm like Please work. Please be good. Please people like this. And the results that we got, like the replies that we got were really good. So I feel pretty good. We're gonna head over to Remoa now. I want to buy a carry-on. I like the titanium though. The titanium is pretty cool. It's just the silver looks just a classic. Yeah. That's my favorite too. I feel like you just can't go wrong with the silver. So why are you buying a new one? Honestly, I have like a Louis Vuitton carry-on that I paid way too much for and it's like way too small and honestly it just has like the LV monogram on it and it looks kind of unpassed out. I want something that doesn't have the logos all over it and I feel like when it comes to luggage, Remo just does it right. Especially for a carry-on because it's not going to get all banged up because my trunk is like pretty banged up but the carry-on would be clean. So what do we get? Going home with some gifts, That's treasure. I got the carry-on, aluminum, and then I got some stickers of places that I've been to. So my remote trunk has a bunch of stickers of places that I've been to. So I added a Brazilian city called Brasilia, capital Brazil, and then I added, what was your old Las Vegas, because I didn't have that sticker yet. Going to Vegas again in a couple weeks for F1, so that should be fun. Yeah, we're going. Yeah, so I'll give you the first time with this baby. You need to be here three minutes? Yes.

I have been teaching him How to drink coffee for the past two and a half years and he's still drinking like sugary like frappuccinos But he's getting there, you know about the progress. It's all about the progress It's a running joke that every time we go to a coffee shop, I'm like, what's your sweetest coffee you have? Because that's what he's gonna have. And he gets all embarrassed, but like that's when he ends up ordering. New York City parking, baby. Always on the limit. This is a nice spot. I just remember that this is the spot.

It's something that has taken us three years to make, to produce. And I'm ready to show you. I'm going to show you a little bit of it today. These are the marketing videos that we created for the new product. It's two fragrances. One is called Protagonist and the other one's called Antagonist. And they're dropping on November 16th.

It's also nice too because Kat wanted the photos today because we have a meeting tomorrow for the fragrance check just to see everything that we just to give an update everyone gives their update on everything that everyone's working on and She wanted to like at least have some of like the landing page and like the page for the fragrance So it'd be nice to send her these photos. She can get started so we can have a little update tomorrow for our meeting Yeah, I mean this is like we have the photos now but now we have to take these photos and we have to create ads, create emails for our newsletter, create social posts for my page, social posts for Forte's page. So there's a lot that needs to happen still, but now we can actually get to work. You know, obviously we were just waiting for these photos to come in, these videos to come in. Now that we have the assets, it's like, it's on us. And I'm confident on just like in our team. So let's just push. Forte, I just had this vision for Forte for so long and I've been so busy doing other things that I kind of let it get away from me a little bit because I was so busy with other things you know there's so many other projects that I'm working on and I kind of dropped the ball a little bit with the Forte creative and just wasn't really like being on top of it and this is the return man this is like we're back First floor!

We're gonna be really good parents. Yes, we are. Take care of him. Yeah. Yeah, he was thirsty. I know. I'm deaf. Yeah. So good. Look at his little tail. His tail is... Look at it. Oh my god, he's just wagging with you. He's a burner dude, so he's like half creamy. No, no. He's called a noodle. Wow. Look at the paws. The paws are so cute. These eight weeks. They're going to wake up. They're going to wake up. Morning guys. Alright. Go week up. We're going all the way up. His ears are probably gone. Yeah, you think his ears are going to hurt? You think so? You see he hide it in the camera? I tried it on camera. Oh my god, what are you doing? What are you doing up here? My first ever dog. How does it feel? Feels good. I've had a family dog but this is my first puppy, my own dog. Always one and one. And it felt like the time was right. So far I'm really happy with his personality. He hasn't really cried, he's just been exploring. Very cute. We'll see tonight, you know, I think I'm mostly worried about my sleep tonight, but I think he'll be okay. Hopefully. Well, you already ruined last night. Yeah, I could sleep last night, I slept for like an hour. His name is Truffle. I think, do we establish that? Yeah. We didn't say Truffle. truffle. We named him after our second date in New York City and we had this truffle pizza that was like incredible and it became like our go-to spot so we named him after that. I'm just looking at photos of him before we got him. The ones that they sent us to see like it a lot has changed you know but he looks the exact same right yeah the breeders were really good like they sent us a lot of photos, videos, look at this video of him playing, you know they sent us like a lot of photos and videos just to an information just communicated with us really well. So Emily and I did a ton of research before we found these breeders and it's we found these breeders called Namaste Bernadoodles and I actually ended up DMing the Namaste Instagram account and the owner replied to me and and he's like, oh, let's chat on the phone right now. He gave me a call and I just felt so confident. And remember when I called him and then you weren't even there, you came home and I was like, I found the guy. Like I found the place, this is the breeder. And you're like, what do you mean? No, like I have to do my research. I'm like, no, this is the one that we've been looking at and like the guy's legit. We were in Brazil and we got the call like, hey, well, I think, you know, I think I found the right for you and we looked at them and I mean immediately we knew that was our dog. So yeah I'm gonna link the breeder below you guys can go check them out they have the best Bernadugos they're half Bernice Mountain dog and half Poodles which means they're chillers they're very easy to get along with Bernice Mountain dog and then they don't shed they're hypoallergenic which is the Poodle side of them. The range they gave us was 35 pounds to 65 pounds so who knows How big is this guy gonna get? How's everyone doing? Hey guys, Friday getting close. Two ways we can go about this one. We can just say get the bundle and save and get a free atomizer. So then it's just like a completely new landing page and skew. Or do we want them to add both skews to the cart and then the atomizer gets added automatically? I'm just wondering how I'm gonna ask for the word. We did a bundle with the two fragrances And they are my surf. So when you're doing complete the look and upselling, you're really just kind of adding the bundle to your cart. I'm assuming that. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So it's like $70 off, essentially, from the customer's perspective. And you want us to show the price? Yeah, I think we should say choose the bundle and save however much. The first image of this carousel here, does it have to be the blank e-commerce photo or can we just do for any fully? Yeah, I think it might look better with the design. I don't know, with some other stuff, we'll see. Yeah, right, the prop, the one with the props. Yeah, props. The image, I think it will look better, but then on the, on the- on the website, product page, yeah. Well guys, thank you so much. We got two weeks to go. You guys enjoy your weekend, have some fun. It's go time, two weeks to launch. I'm excited. All right my dude, you're all packed up and ready to go. Yes sir. Rodrigo is running the marathon in Toronto this Sunday in two days. You excited?

        "transcript": " Looking your best doesn't have to be complicated. The secret to go from looking average to looking great is in the details. Take it from someone who's been through a massive transformation just by following these steps that I'm about to give you. Your hair will look better, your teeth, your skin. These seven grooming secrets will make you look more attractive and more confident than you've ever felt. First up, one of the most overlooked things in men's grooming is your neckline. A survey by Men's Health actually found that 74% of women prefer men who maintain a well-groomed, haircut. Now these women also said that men with a fresh haircut look more confident, look more attractive. But we don't have the time or funds to be getting haircuts every day, right? So the next best option is this. Use a mirror and then just shave along your natural hairline. Make sure not to go too high up. Just follow your hairline and clean it up. You can use a normal razor for this, which I used to do. But last year I got one of these foil shavers and it makes it even easier. It doesn't trim long hair so you can pretty much get as close as you onto your hairline without having to worry about messing it up. It's wild to me how many guys ignore this. You can have a great hairstyle, right? But if your neckline is hairy, if it's messy, it ruins the whole look. And trust me, people notice this way more than you think. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean that other people won't. And the pro tip is to use your phone or a handheld mirror to see the back of your head while you do it. Don't just guess where you're going to be shaving, right? Because you can easily mess that up and make it so much worse. And I know it's a small thing, but it makes a big difference. Trust me, once you start paying attention to this detail, you're going to look sharper every single day. Now something all of us men have to do, but don't necessarily like doing, is shaving. Let's be real, it's time consuming, you get razor bumps, your skin gets irritated and you have to keep doing it. It just feels like the more you shave, the faster your hair grows. If you're tired of dealing with ingrown hairs, raise your bumps. Or if you're just tired of having to shave every single day, I have a much better solution for you. Laser hair removal. And before you think, isn't that just for women? No, this is for anyone who wants smooth skin without the hassle of shaving all the time. More and more men are choosing laser hair removal because the results are just way better than shaving. I don't know if you're an old subscriber, but if you are, then you know that I started getting laser hair removal on my neck a long time ago because my neck was always filled with ingrowns. And it looked horrible. It was uncomfortable, right? So I got an expensive package deal to get eight treatments and honestly it was life changing. My hair got thinner, most of it was gone, I barely get any ingrowns. And I like the results so much that I did more sessions this time on my leg. I actually did three treatments to thin out the hair on my leg before I got my tattoos because I didn't want the hair to cover the tattoos. And I'm so glad I did because I'm pretty hairy and you can't get laser once you have tattoos. That's literally how they remove tattoos. So you have to get it done before you get your ink done. But this was over 10 years ago. Nowadays, these machines got a lot smaller and more affordable. Check this out. This is the U-Like X. It's the first laser hair removal device made specifically for men. It has extra power to target thick, coarse, male hair. There are sponsor, and of course, that means that you get a special discount on this device. And what's so great about it is that you can use it at home on the go. There's no need to book expensive appointments. need to leave the comfort of your home. Just power it up in your bathroom and use it and within two weeks you're gonna start noticing a massive reduction in hair growth whether you use it on your chest, your shoulders, your hands, wherever you want to get rid of unwanted hair. And the best part is that you see results in just a few sessions. Also over time the hair barely grows back at all. And for my guys who want to know if it hurts, right, it's a common question. It's nearly painless because you see this here, this is the ice cold tip that cools your skin down as you're using the device. So that numbs the area and makes it really comfortable to use. So if you're tired of shaving every day or dealing with the constant expensive razors and shaving cream, if you get ingrowns like I did, it's time to step up your grooming routine. I'm going to leave a link below with a special discount for my followers. You get $130 off this device, so this is your chance to finally take control of your grooming and your hairy back, your chest, your hands, or who knows what else. This next grooming tip is something that a lot of guys skip, but according to research, 78% of women prefer men who do this. You need to start using your body lotion to get rid of those dry spots on your hands, your elbows, your knees, and your feet. Most guys tend to get dry in those areas. Because women are so used to applying body lotion daily, they notice these things. If you have dry elbows, trust me, they're going to see that. Just do me a favor and feel your elbows right now. How do they feel? about your knees and your feet? Those are the areas that tend to get dry and flaky, so focus on those areas when you're applying the lotion. Applying lotion takes literally 30 seconds, right? And it's a game-changer. Your skin is going to feel a lot better. It's going to look healthier, right? If you have tattoos like I do, by the way, you should be using body lotion on them to keep them looking new and fresh and more vibrant. And you should obviously use it in every part of your body, but especially your hands because they're the most visible. If you have workout calluses, right, like I do, or if the top of your hand is dry, This is a step that you should not skip and the best time to apply lotion is right after you shower You're already naked in your bathroom Just apply it before you put your clothes on and there's one extra benefit of using body lotion that I know you're gonna like Because it's such a good hack that most guys don't know you've probably noticed that sometimes Coulons fade really quickly and that's because most guys they spray it on dry skin Fragments last much longer on Moisturized skin so when your skin is hydrated it holds on to your fragrance way better making the scent last a lot longer. So right after you apply the body lotion, that is the perfect time to spray your favorite fragrance on your pulse points, your wrists, your neck, and behind your ears. And you do that because those are the areas where your skin is warmer, because the blood vessels are close to the surface. Now, the heat is gonna help activate and release the scent throughout the day. I like to spray each of my wrists, and when you spray your wrists, don't rub them together. This is a common mistake. It crushes the scent molecules, and it makes your scent fade away quicker. So one spray on each wrist, don't rub them together. Then one right under your throat, then one spray on each side of your neck just below the neckline right here. If you want some extra strength, extra projection, then add one last spray on the back of your neck, which is great if you're moving around a lot because you're gonna leave that nice subtle trail of your scent when you're walking by someone, which is always a plus. Speaking of hair, I don't know why men are so bad with their shower routines. I was talking to a friend who's 32 years old, by the way, And he asked me how I wash my hair. I was surprised. Like how do you not feel confident in the way that you wash your hair, right? So here it is for you guys too, because if he asked it, then I'm sure that a lot of guys have the same questions. When you're in the shower, here's the best way to shampoo your hair properly. Remember, the reason why you're shampooing isn't to clean the ends of your hair, it's the scalp. That's where the oils, the gunk, the hair products, it just melts down into your scalp, so you need to cleanse it with shampoo. Once your hair is fully wet, that's when you use a good amount of shampoo to cleanse. You wanna start by lathering the shampoo in your hands first and then massaging it into your scalp, not just your hair. And massaging your scalp with your fingertips also increases blood flow to the area which promotes healthy hair growth. So you're killing two birds with one stone. Then of course there's the water temperature, right? And yes, it makes a big difference. Hot water, it might feel good and relaxing, right? But it actually dries out your scalp and your hair which leads to frizzy and damaged hair. Instead, use lukewarm water for washing your hair. And then for the final rinse, you're gonna switch to cold water. Cold water locks in moisture. It gives your hair a shinier, healthier look. And finally, after shampooing, apply a conditioner to the ends of your hair, not the scalp this time. Let it sit for a minute or two, and then rinse it out with cold water to seal in that moisture. The thing about cold water is not just for your hair. It's also a game changer when it comes to your face and your skin. Most guys don't realize that using hot water to watch your face can actually dry out your skin and it causes irritation. Hot water, it basically strips away all of your skin's natural oils. It leaves it dehydrated and sometimes it even causes breakouts. So the last thing you want is dry, irritated skin, especially when you're trying to look your best. That's why tip number six is to use cold water to rinse your face. Cold water tightens your pores, which reduces the chance of dirt and oil getting trapped in them. It also helps to reduce puffiness, right? Especially if you're someone who wakes up looking swollen or with eye bags, splashing cold water on your face in the morning wakes up your skin. It helps you look more alert, more attractive. But beyond that, cold water also helps improve circulation, which brings more oxygen, more nutrients to your skin. It gives your face a nice, natural glow. When your blood flow improves, it also gives your skin a nice, more even-toned, healthy, vibrant appearance. Something that hot water just can't do, right? It's a small step, I know, but it makes you look more refreshed, more polished throughout the day especially if you're dealing with redness on your face or puffiness under your eyes and really if you're trying to look as attractive as possible and I know most of us are. This next tip is going to make the biggest difference because men's hair is like women's makeup. You can completely change the way that you look by getting a haircut or changing up your hairstyle. You can literally become a new man with a new hairstyle. But here's the thing, here's where most guys mess up. They're not using the right hair products for their hair type. Let me tell you, different hair types are gonna need different hair products to look their absolute best. You can't just grab the same product that your friend uses and then expect it to work for you. If you have fine straight hair and he's got thick curly hair, you're gonna need completely different products to get the results that you want. For example, if you have really fine, thin hair and you use a heavy pomade or a heavy clay, it's just gonna weigh it down. It's gonna make it look greasy. It's gonna make it look flat. Instead, you want to use lighter products like a lightweight styling cream that adds hold and it adds lift without making your hair look greasy or heavy. On the other hand, if you have thick, curly, coarse hair, you need products with more hold, more moisture. A light cream isn't going to cut it, right? Your hair needs something more substantial like a good pomade, a heavy clay or a paste that adds control without making it feel crunchy and dry. And for those of you guys with wavy hair, the sea salt spray can enhance your natural texture while giving you a bit of control. And then there's the product finish, right? Some product give you a matte finish, which looks more natural, laid back. While others, they're going to give you a shiny, slicked back look. If you're looking for a more relaxed, casual style, matte is usually the way to go. But if you want more polished for a wedding or a big night out, a product with some shine can give you a nice, that classic shine that we all love seeing. If you don't know which hairstyle to go for, I highly recommend this video right here that I just posted. I'll see you there."

        "transcript": " I used to think I had bad hair. I kept it short because I didn't know how to style it. And honestly, I didn't believe that it could look good. I have naturally wavy to curly hair. And when I was younger, straight hair was all the rage. So I thought, why would I even try? Right? My hair sucks. So I keep it short enough so we wouldn't curl up, then throw some drugstore gel on it and call it a day. But deep down, I was always jealous of those guys with great hair. Those who could grow it out and style it, flaunt it, get compliments from girls. In my mind, I was never going to be that guy. And in this video, I'm going to show you exactly how I did it and how you can do it too. And before that, I want to bring you back to one of the most important days of my life. And I'll never forget this day because I'm not exaggerating when I say that this day changed my entire life. I needed a haircut and instead of going to my usual place, which was a supercut in LA and paying $17 for a haircut, I splurged and I went to this salon that costs $40. And I'll be the first one to admit that it hurt me. It hurt my wallet to pay more than twice what I was paying before, but it was close to my apartment. It looked nice and I splurged. And the guy who was cutting my hair was the owner of the salon. His name was also Alex. He said to me, you know, you have great hair. You should let it grow a little bit longer. And I honestly thought he was joking. I was shocked because no one had ever told me that before. He told me that if I wanted my hair to be less curly, you could do a treatment to relax the curls and the waves in my hair. And honestly, that moment changed everything for me. I wanted to style my hair in a slicked back undercut, which looking back now is a terrible hairstyle, but at the time it was really popular because of Brad Pitt in the movie Fury. So I let my hair grow, I went back to him, I got the treatment, and it was actually one of my very first hair videos I ever posted on YouTube, back when I was just starting here, back when I was broke and I had no idea what I was doing. But man, the amount of compliments I got because of that hairstyle was crazy. That haircut, as bad as it seems today, it changed my life because it made me want to experiment with my hair and my looks. And since then, I've had every hairstyle you can imagine. But if I hadn't tried, if he hadn't given me the confidence to try something new, I'd probably still have that same hairstyle I had all my life, short with some cheap gel on it. And if you think about it, my life would be different. Maybe I wouldn't even have started my hair product brand because experimenting with hair gave me the knowledge and the confidence to create Forte Series, which by the way, just turned five years old today. The day that I'm shooting this video. It's a big achievement for me because over half of new businesses in the US fail by year five, so we just beat that statistic.

It's the perfect time to stock up or to try our products for the very first time. And so I'm posting this video because I know there are a lot of guys out there who think they're stuck with bad hair when really they just need to get the right style and the right products. A great hairstyle can literally change your life. It changed mine. And look, it's not taboo anymore for a guy to care about his hair. It's the norm. Back when I started, people would call me all sorts of names because I took care of myself, but now it's becoming more and more common. I mean, just look at the trend. It's getting bigger and bigger. So I don't want you to miss out on looking your best. It's not just about looking good either. It's about feeling good when you leave your house to go to work or school or on a date. I'm here to show you that you can improve your looks and it's actually really easy. I'm gonna walk you through exactly how to find your face shape, the best hairstyles for your face shape and the best hairstyles for your hair type. And trust me, by the end of this video, you're gonna know exactly how to finally have great hair. And the first step to finding the perfect hairstyle is knowing your face shape, right? And the reason why this is very important is because the right hairstyle can balance out your proportions and enhance your facial features. So here's how you're gonna figure it out. There are six main face shapes, oval, square, round, rectangle, diamond, and triangle. And each of these has its own ideal set of hairstyles that can make your features really pop. And to find your face shape, it literally takes less than 30 seconds. You're just gonna need to measure your face, and that's it, four areas, your forehead, your cheekbones, your jawline, and your facial length. And you can use a soft measuring tape like this one here, right? Or even just a ruler. You're gonna start by measuring your forehead width from hairline to hairline as the widest point. Then measure the width of your cheekbones, jawline, and then the length of your hairline down to your chin. And then you're gonna compare these measurements to see which shape matches yours best. And if that sounds like too much work, or if you want a quicker way, you can use the Forte Face Shape Guide filter on TikTok or on Instagram. It's super easy, just open the app, follow the guide, and it's gonna tell you exactly which face shape matches yours instantly. And in a minute, we're gonna go over the best hairstyles for each face shape, which is really good to know, but that doesn't tell the whole story. It's much better to understand why these hairstyles work for each face shape rather than just seeing a list. So let's say you have a round face shape. If you get a bus cut, your face is gonna continue to look round, which typically is seen as less masculine, not as strong as like an oval or a square face shape. So by adding height up top, your hairstyle will literally create an illusion that your face shape isn't round. It's now oval. You see how powerful your hairstyle can be? It can completely change the way that you look. It can completely change your face shape. And the moment I understood that, the moment that it clicked for me, was when I went from having that slicked back undercut, which was really flat, to adding volume to the top of my hairstyle. I have a square face shape, so I needed to add some volume up top to make my face look longer, and he made a huge difference for me. And this is the exact haircut right here that made me realize that. It was this day. I love that I have all of that on YouTube, by the way. You can go back to my old videos. If you think you can't look better than you do right now, I encourage you to go back to my old videos when I was in my 20s, okay? And I looked older and worse than I do today at 36 years old. And for the beginner guys that are watching this, if you've never experimented with your hair before, here are three easy tips to get started. One, try a small change, okay? Like growing your hair out a little bit longer, trying a different haircut. Two, go to a men's salon rather than a barber shop. Ask a ton of questions. Learn as much as possible. And three, experiment with different products to see which texture is gonna work best for you. Now, let's get tactical, right? I'm gonna show you the best hairstyles for each face shape and the exact product that you should use to achieve that hairstyle. If you have an oval face, you're in luck because this is the most versatile face shape possible. Almost any hairstyle is gonna work for you, But if you really want to maximize your look go for styles that add a little bit more volume up top All keeping the sides a little bit shorter Think of guys like Zane Malik or Adam Levine when they rock a quiff or a classic side part These styles are gonna add height and structure and he plays up the balance that you naturally already have because you're a lucky Dude right a brushed up fringe using the forte molding pace is gonna look great a quiff Which was my go-to hairstyle for years styled with our bestseller the forte series texture clay extreme hold which is also on sale right now, or the middle part using the Forte series styling cream that always going to work for an oval face shape. Next, if you have a square face, which means sharp angles and a wide jawline, which is what I have, and by the way, even more accentuated, right, because of my beard, which if you're just now learning about changing your face shape with your hairstyle, guess what? Facial hair does the same exact thing. Let me know if you want a video on that too. For square face shapes, ideally you keep the sides a little bit tighter to emphasize your jaw, right? Like I keep my sides pretty tight for the longer hairstyle that I have. It's a lot shorter on the size than it is up top. You can go for a little bit of volume up top like I have. You can go for a messy quiff style with the Forte series texture clay or the 80-20 side part with the cream or even close cropped curls like this with the sea salt spray. Tom Hardy has a square face shape for example. His hairstyle always enhances natural strong square face, right? It makes him look even more powerful. On the On the other hand, if you have a round face, your goal is to create the illusion of length, like I said before. So the key is to add volume up top while keeping the sides even shorter. Go for a high-end type fade, like Justin Timberlake, for example, he always rocks that. Style it with the Forte styling cream or a curly fade styled with a sea salt spray. I mean, look at how this is just elongating his face. A spiky undercut is also a good option. The Forte series texture powder is perfect for this hairstyle. Remember what I said earlier, adding height gives you the impression of an oval face which is considered the ideal shape. Guys like Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake, they mastered this look by adding that extra height on top. Now for my rectangle face guys, you want to make sure that you don't elongate your face any further. The goal here is to balance that length that you have with some width. So a side part with the Forte series molding paste or a side swept look with the sea salt spray, that's going to add that width. It's gonna bring more balance to your face think of someone like Henry Cavill He uses these styles to add symmetry He makes his longer face shape look well proportioned and balance now Let's talk about the diamond face shape which by the way is one of the most rare face shapes It looks really great It's all about playing up those sharp cheekbones that you have you want to add volume to the sides and avoid those Overly tight cuts a wavy textured style with the cream would look good a variation of the quiff is great Or even a bus cut because the cheekbones will pop right think of Brad Pitt in the movie Mr. And Mrs. Smith looks awesome, right? If you have a triangle face you want to draw attention Upwards because you have a really wide jaw line So you want to balance that out a style that adds volume up top and keeps the sides fuller Are gonna balance out your narrow forehead and your stronger jaw the 80-20 side part looks great on those guys a texture Crop styled with the forte powder is also gonna look amazing now that you know your face shape and the styles for it to really unlock the full power, the full potential of your hair, you need to know your hair texture, whether it's curly, wavy, straight or coarse, because that plays a huge role in how your hairstyle will actually turn out. For example, if I let my hair air dry with no product without brushing it or styling it after the shower, this is what it looks like because my hair has that texture. I know that. So if I want this style, I heat up my hair while pulling on it lightly with the brush. This is our newest brush, by the way, made exactly for this. You pull the hair up, you heat it up, and just like that, you can adjust the texture of your hair. So what type of hair do you have? And what type of hairstyle do you want to achieve? Because you should know that pretty much everything is possible in the hair world. Straight hair can be permed into curls. Curly hair can get straight with a Brazilian blowout. And if you have fine hair, you can literally fly to Turkey and they'll plant some new hair growth onto your receding hairline. It's really all about deciding the amount of effort that you want to put in if you want those changes. But it's all possible. 42% of men with fine hair reported feeling more confident when using volume enhancing products that don't make their hair look greasy like the forte thickening spray. It's great for guys who don't have that much hair and want to make it look fuller. But if you have thick coarse hair, you need something strong with more hold like the forte pomade or the texture clay to keep it in place. A study from the National Institute of Health found that 73% of men felt more confident when they started using the right products for their hair type. That's a huge number, 73%. It makes sense though, right? When you have the right tools, you're also able to style your hair in a way that looks its best and that it stays in place all day long. And that's why I started Forte Series five years ago. To help men like you unlock their full potential, starting with your hair. Remember, you get 25% off the entire website to celebrate five years of Forte. The sale is for a limited time only. It's Fortes Series dot com. I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " When I was younger, I used to think that being masculine was all about how much I could bench or how many girls I could pick up. And let's be honest, most of us guys have felt that pressure at some point, right? As a matter of fact, the study said that 59% of young men say that they feel this pressure to live up to that version of masculinity that may not be the right version of masculinity. But the truth is that mindset is only going to hold you back. If you want to become a respected successful man, you need to redefine what masculinity really means. So in this video, I'm going to break down the six traits of a classically masculine man and showing you what advice to ignore. And there's a lot of it. These are the traits that will make people admire you for all the right reasons. Let's start with the first trait and that is strength. See, the thing about strength is that most guys think that strength is all about having big muscles, right? And sure, physical strength is important, right? But it's not the whole picture. Real masculine strength is mental and emotional strength too. Let me break it down for you with two examples. Jason Momoa and David Goggin. Jason's physical strength is obvious, right? The guy looks like he could bench press a car. But Goggins, his strength goes way beyond just physical. The guy ran 100 miles in 24 hours. But what really sets him apart is his mental resilience. He's all about pushing past the pain, past the hardship, with sheer willpower. It's all in here. That's the level of strength that's inspiring. It's not just about lifting weights. You have to lift yourself up when life gets tough. Physical strength might make you stand out, but when real challenges hit, whether it's a tough day at work, personal setbacks, it's the mental toughness that earns you that respect. So here's what I recommend, build both types of strength, work out at least three times a week to stay in shape, stay active and eat healthy. On top of that, you need to have real conversations with people that you trust so you can share your unfiltered, honest thoughts. And this is the most important one, you have to practice being centered. If someone's spilling a drink on you at the bar or bumping into you on the street, gets you angry, gets you frustrated, you haven't built the right mental strength. You need to know when to use mental strength and when to use physical strength. That's what makes a great man. Thomas Shelby, for example, from Peaky Blinders, right? He shows mental toughness, strategic thinking. He's always two steps ahead of his rivals. Sure, he can be physically tough, but it's his mind that gets him the upper hand. Okay, so mastering strength already sets you apart from the average guy, but you can't become a classically masculine man with just one trait. You need a full set of qualities that work together, and that's why these next five traits are gonna separate boys from men. And if you want to keep earning respect, you're going to be using this next straight every single day. And that's having integrity. It's underrated, but it's pure gold. Because people think integrity means being the nice guy, or being a pushover. It's about being real. You're the same person, whether you're with your friends, your girlfriend, your boss, or even yourself at 2 AM scrolling on your phone. Studies actually show that guys with high integrity are more likely to climb the career ladder and to build better relationships. Why? Because when people know that you're honest and reliable, they trust you. That's like a cheat code for success. Let me give you an example. Imagine it's your friend's birthday. Everyone's planning a night out. That's gonna cost way more than you can afford, right? You know you shouldn't go. You know this is way too expensive. But you're tempted to go along just to keep up. Integrity is having the courage to say no. It might sting for a second. You might be embarrassed. But you're gonna earn respect for being upfront. And you're gonna respect yourself as well. Rather than flaking at the last minute, pretending that, you know, you can afford it, but you're just tired or something like that. You're lying to people and you're just lying to yourself. truth is you can't afford it and that is okay. You can live with that. Same goes for making mistakes at work. You can easily blame someone else, hope no one notices, but owning up to your mistakes, that's where integrity shines. It's uncomfortable, but it's also the quickest way to earn the respect of your team. People trust you because they know that you're not gonna be s'd them because you're trustworthy. The key is being real, not perfect. Integrity doesn't mean having to spill your guts 24 seven. It's not this mushy thing, but it does mean staying true to your values and avoiding excuses or fake stories. Now, once you have the strength and the integrity down, the next straight is where things start to really change for you. To understand the straight, let's talk about someone who you probably all know, Cristiano Ronaldo. His confidence didn't come from just being born with natural talent, right? It came from years of hard work, practicing, mastering his skills, constantly leveling up, constantly proving people wrong. That's why competence leads to confidence. Confident men don't pretend to know everything, right? In fact, the more competent you are, The more you realize how much more there is to learn, which is an exciting part of life. It's like leveling up in a video game. Each time you conquer a new challenge, you become better equipped for the next one. And this applies to everything. Whether it's your career, managing your finances, building relationships, a classically masculine man knows that being well-rounded is key. You need to understand your finances. You need to develop emotional intelligence. You need to solve problems on the fly. So here's the challenge. Pick one skill that you really wanna get better at. It could be public speaking. It could be learning a new language, cooking, play in the guitar, commit to spending 15 minutes a day on it. Watch tutorials. Nowadays you can find everything online, right? Read books, watch podcasts, whatever helps you improve. The key is to show up every single day for those 15 minutes. Now let's move on to a trade that ties everything together. Self-reliance. And it doesn't mean doing everything alone or being a lonely guy, right? It just means being grounded, being confident in your own decisions. It's about knowing when to look inward instead of always chasing approval from others around you. Think of your dad, your grandfather, your coach, right? When things get tough, did they just crumble? Did they blame others? No, they take responsibility even when it's not their fault. That's self-reliance. Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor who has been studied so much and thought of so well, so spoken of so highly, he nailed this. He said, you have power over your mind, right? Not outside events. realize this and you're gonna find your true strength. Now, next time that you're faced with a decision, don't rush to seek validation. Take a moment, reflect, trust yourself. You know, if things don't go according to plan, don't be pointing fingers. You gotta own up to it. That's how you build true strength. That's how you have that integrity. And that's how you're gonna have that self-reliance. Now, we've talked about some of these internal traits, but being a man is also about how you engage with the world, right? And that brings us to the next two traits. Starting with the power of your network. and everyone has heard the saying, you're the average of the five people they spend the most time with. And guess what? And science packs it up. A study from Northwestern found that high performers push each other to succeed, leading to a 15% boost in performance. No man, no matter how strong, makes it along. A masculine man understands the value of surrounding himself with people who challenge him to level up. Every time I see someone major, a celebrity here in New York City or in LA, an actor, right, a musician, a high net worth person walking into a lounge or a restaurant that I'm in, that person's not alone. That person usually has a posse, a bunch of people around them. It's not about collecting Instagram followers, it's about building real meaningful collections, quality over quantity every time. Focus on deeper interactions and build a network of people who inspire you, people who challenge you. And that's exactly why I created Men's Image Lab. It's an online community that's free, by the way, for like-minded men who want to level up. So if you're interested, check out the link in the description below. We have over 3,000 men in the community right now leveling up together. It's really all about your network. You need to be able to see what other people were doing to level up for you to even understand what's possible. When I was younger and I was hanging around a bunch of losers who didn't do anything, I thought that was it. That was all life had to offer, right? I was just gonna be the same type of person. I was also gonna be a loser and that was it. I made some new friends in high school and I can't tell you how much my life changed. That moment, I remember it exactly in high school And that has happened to me multiple times in my life. When I talk to someone who just unlocks something in my brain, right? For me, the first time I flew business class, I was like, I'm never gonna be able to do this again. I got like a free upgrade. And I was like, this is never gonna happen again. So let me enjoy it. And then as I started hanging out with more people who fly business every single time they fly, I started to realize, wait, these people aren't better than me. They're not more naturally talented than I am. How can I get to that level? It just unlocks that something in your brain that shows you, wait, I have a little bit left of potential here that I should be squeezing out. Or maybe it's a lot of potential that I should be squeezing out, right? So be around people who are gonna do that to you. If you wanna be around those people, it's that first link in the bio, check out Men's Image Lab, it's a free community for you. Now, let's go into the final trade and this is the most important one because leadership isn't about titles or authority. It's about stepping up when it counts. When things get tough, real leaders, they take action, right, they're not just talking. Think about the guy in your group who always has the right answers when things go wrong or the person at work who finds solutions instead of complaining, that's leadership. Being the person who acts while everyone else hesitates. And here's the truth, leaders aren't born that way. They're made. You become a leader by making the choice to step up, to take responsibility and to inspire those people around you. And remember these six traits, they're not just a checklist for you to go through. They're a guide for how to live your life as this masculine man. You should choose to follow these guidelines because that's gonna set you apart from everyone else. And if you wanna keep leveling up, this video right here is a must watch. I'll see you there."

        "transcript": " I feel like I blink and all of a sudden I'm 36 years old. 2024 is almost over and every year that goes by feels like it's going by faster. What I want you to get from this video is really just one main thing. Your time here with your family, friends, your life, it goes by fast. So my hope is that this video pushes you to live a good life, a life of purpose, a life of happiness, a life filled with memories, a life that you're proud of because the opposite of that is a life without purpose. a life with remorse. And if you're new here, hi, my name is Alex. I went from making pizzas to being unemployed, to being an EMT, to working full time at Google. Then I quit that to grow this channel and build multiple seven figure businesses. And the lessons that I'm sharing today, they got me through some tough times. And now my life is unrecognizable from what it was before. And lesson number one is unfortunately something that most of us forget and we lose as we grow up. But if you want to build confidence, if you want to unlock opportunities, You should never lose curiosity. You have to be curious enough to learn new skills. Being interested in how things work will open doors that you never knew existed. I remember when I was 21, I was working as an EMT in the Boston area, and my goal was to become a firefighter. That was my dream. So I had to become an EMT first, then a paramedic, that's how it works, and then become a firefighter. My best friend's mom at the time, she was a firefighter. So every time I go over to his place, I go up to her and I would just ask her a ton of questions about her job, what her day to day was like, if she liked her superiors. A ton of questions about what I had to do to get there because I wanted to be where she was at. And she gave me so many tips, so much advice that I knew exactly what I had to do to make my dream of becoming a firefighter a reality. You have to trust in your ability to figure things out because asking questions, even simple ones, will guide you in your life. Now I ended up going a completely different direction as you can tell and I became obsessed with YouTube around that time. I had no idea how to shoot, had no idea how to edit when I started, I didn't know how to work a camera, I was self-conscious about shooting videos, but I didn't let that stop me. I'm just gonna figure this out as I go, you know, step by step, I'm gonna figure this out. And that same curiosity, it pushed me to launch my hair in my clothing brands, even though I had no experience in those industries. It was a risk, but it paid off. Now I create content and products for millions around the world and being curious, asking questions played a big role in that success. Moving forward, I want you to ask questions every day about something new. If you don't know how something works, find out that information is out there. Chat GPT knows everything. Ask questions. People love talking about things that they love. So if you ask someone who loves cars about car mechanics, they're going to love to tell you and you're going to learn a lot. But the truth is being curious, isn't enough if you're not willing to do lesson number two, which is work hard, but enjoy life. I've worked really, really hard in my life. I've burned myself out multiple times because I'd work day and night with no rest, no days off, months at a time, all because I felt like if I didn't reach my goals, I'd be a loser. It's a toxic mentality because the truth is not all of us are going to be successful. I got lucky. My hard work paid off, but I know that's not the case for a lot of people. It wasn't until I was in my 30s that I realized I can work and enjoy life. Working 24 seven isn't effective. It's not realistic. You need rest. You need sleep. You need to decompress. And for that to happen, you need to learn how to be efficient with your time. You need to set boundaries. When you're working, give it a hundred percent. Give it your all. When you're off, actually turn everything off. Just be done with it. I was just in the South of France for a few days if you got my Instagram and I was enjoying the last little bit of summer. And if this was a few years ago, I would be working every day, at least for a few hours, doing that trip. Nowadays I actually get time off. I actually get to enjoy the time off while I'm traveling. This week I want you to tackle one hard task that you've been putting off. Then ask yourself, how can I be more effective with my time? Speaking of hard work, there's one area that you cannot afford to slack on and that is taking care of your body. Look, your body is the only one that you have. And if you're in your 20s, now is the time to lock in your self-care habits because it's going to set you up for the rest of your life. If you wait too long, then you build those really tough habits to rebuild, right? You kind of have that scar tissue over those habits and it's going to be a lot harder to work that muscle. Think about it this way. If someone gave you a pill that could make you think clear, feel better, be more attractive and even add years to your life. Would you say yes to that pill? Well that's what exercise does for you and the best part is that it's free to start. Look, when I was 19, I had to leave the US because my visa expired and I had to wait almost two years in Brazil to get my new visa. My life was upside down. I moved back to my hometown in Brazil and I was lost. I didn't really know what to do. I was going to college in the US. I had my friends here. I had two jobs. I had a girlfriend, right? So when I got to Brazil, I was depressed. I started teaching English at a school just to pay my bills. I let go of my body. I stopped working out for a few months and I remember one day finally I looked in the mirror and I said to myself, enough is enough. I was like skinny fat and there was just no shape or reason for my body. My hair looked like shit. I had let go of myself completely. And I know it sounds weird right now because I'm like, you know, the self-improvement guy here on YouTube, but I had my own journey as well. And I've made mistakes along the way too. So I walked 20 minutes to the closest gym and I signed up that day. Then I went home and I buzzed my own hair because it was too long. It was all over the place. It was messy. I hadn't got a real haircut in a while because I was broke. If you're in a bad placement to leave working out and seeing results will change your life. It gives you that motivation. Being fit, being in shape, it solves half of your problems. You're going to feel healthy. You're going to look good. You're going to gain your confidence back and it snowballs into other winds. So if you're there right now in a place where you just don't feel your best, you look in the mirror and you're just not happy with yourself and you think enough is enough just like I did, hit the gym man. Right after this video, get active, go for a run, play a sport, go out with a friend. Don't wait for motivation. Just start. This is your motivation. But of course, health isn't just about you. It's also about who you surround yourself with. That's why lesson number four is surround yourself with the right people. And this is everything in your life. Trust me. You've probably heard the saying, you're the average of the five people that you spend the most time with. This is 100% true. And I wish I knew this when I was growing up in my 20s. I just didn't have the same access to information as you guys do now, right? Because this is everywhere nowadays. It's all over social media. This is the biggest lesson that I learned when I moved to LA from a small town in Massachusetts. Making new friends after high school or college, it's not easy. I get that, right? But it's one of the best investments that you can make in yourself. You don't need a huge group of friends, by the way, just a handful of great people who push you to grow or push you to do whatever it is that you want to accomplish. When I see my friends doing cool things, it pushes me to do the same. I was in France for this wedding, right? Just a few days ago. The most beautiful location the guys are connected with while I was there, they're all making seven or eight figures. They're all wearing insane watches that cost over hundreds of thousands of dollars. They're married. Some of them have kids. They travel the world, right? They're always flying first class. It sounds so extravagant, doesn't it? It sounds lavish. It sounds almost overwhelming. But if you're going to be in a plane for 10 hours, do you want to be first or economy? The first time I flew business, it was a free upgrade. I got lucky. I didn't even have a crazy status with the airline. I think the girl fell bad for me because I was late and I was flustered to get to board. And she gave me a new ticket and she was like, I think you're going to like this one. And I didn't even look at it. I just got into the plane and then when I got in, they said, this is your seat. And it was like a live flat business class ticket from Brazil to the US. And I thought, let me enjoy this. I'm going to have my moment. Yeah, I'm going to eat everything. I'm going to stay. I'm not even going to sleep. Every second of this experience, I want to remember. I want to really appreciate it. Why? Because I might never, ever be up here again. And that was my real mindset at the time. This is never going to happen again. I need to squeeze every little opportunity, every little second of this opportunity, because I, there's no way I'm going to be up here. I'm never going to buy one of these. It's too expensive for me. I can't do this. And that's the mindset I had because no one I knew back then flew business. So why would I think that I'd ever fly business? I was making 50 grand a year. But if you're around people that do that regularly, right? If that's all they do, if those nice watches, that's all they have, right? Then it becomes a lot more real. It becomes tangible. Now you start to think, wait a second, I want to be up there too. I want to be one a not 33 F. If they can do it, I can do it too. So this is what I want you to do. Write a list of the five people that you interact with the most. and then think about whether you want to be like those five people because the truth is if you don't, then it's time to make new connections. It's time to get connected to people who will push you for more or at minimum show you what's possible. They're going to open your eyes to new possibilities that you've never even imagined. And if you're ready to make a change, if you're serious about this, we have a community of over 3000 guys who meet on zoom, who meet up in person and who are always helping each other out. It's the best thing that you can do right now to become a better man. and it's free. So you literally have no excuse. It's called Men's Image Lab. There's no other community that will help you with your looks, with your communication skills that will give you honest feedback. There's nothing else like it. I'm gonna leave you a link below, but remember that just because it's free doesn't mean that we're gonna let you in. We're only letting guys in who actually want to become better, so just answer the questions. Make sure that you put your information down. Guys who want more for themselves, that's what we want in there. If you want to be where you are today, If the five people you wrote down are great and you want to be like them, you don't need to join. But if you want more, join us and let's do this. And I know this sounds scary, but don't be afraid to cut ties with people who hold you back. It's tough, but sometimes it's really the only way forward. Remember though that building a network, it's not about using people, right? It's not like you're going to form these connections with these people just based out of what you want from them. It's about forming genuine lasting connections. As a matter of fact, The best way to build connections with someone is to provide value first, not to take value. So when you join, for example, Man's Image Lab, provide value. People will see this guy is a stand up guy. He's helping everybody out. No one asked for help, but he's helping people out. Cool. Let me give him a follow. Let me send him a message. Let me connect with this person on Zoom. That's how you build connections. You provide value upfront. And you need that because no one makes it to the top alone. Every successful person has a strong support system behind them, whether it's their team, their parents, their friends, siblings sometimes, even their advisors, right? But of course, it's not just about your connections, it's also about your everyday habits, specifically your spending habits. That's why lesson number five is you need to get smart about your finances. I was talking to someone the other day and they said that they never looked at their bank accounts, never. They didn't even keep track of how much they spent, how much they had in the bank. And this person did that because they were struggling financially and he was demotivating to look at their bank account every day. So the answer, I'm gonna stop looking at my bank account because it's depressing. That's like a boxer saying, I'm losing this fight so I might as well put my hands down and close my eyes. You're gonna get knocked out, that's the answer. Don't let that happen, bring your hands up, get back in the fight. You have so much time left to turn things around but for that to happen, you need to know the problem inside and out. You need to be looking at your finances every day. As painful as that might be, make a plan. If you're in debt, think I'm gonna pay off my credit cards because those usually have the highest interest amount. Then I'm gonna start saving, right? Even if it's just a small amount every month, something that might feel dumb at first, but it's not about the money right now, it's about building the habit of looking at your bank account, making those notes, right? This is what I need, this is what's going wrong, this is what I need to change. It's flexing that muscle, getting used to saving money every single month. If I ask you right now, realistically, how much do you need to be making a year to feel good about your situation, to feel great? The majority of people would probably just say, I need to make $100,000 a year. I don't know why 100K became the go-to number, but I can tell you right now, it's not the right amount. It might be less, it might be way more. 100K just tells me that you actually have no idea, you're just throwing out a popular number because you actually don't know how much you need and 100K is nice and round. Instead, think about the life that you want, where you want to live, your lifestyle, your long-term goals, do the math, get in there the nitty gritty details. Guys, this is your life. Don't let it just get out of hand, out of control. The sooner you get this figured out, the better your life is gonna be. But of course, don't just save money, right? You need to educate yourself. Read books, watch podcasts on this topic. Take courses on personal finance, investing. Talk to your friends about it. I've actually found this out. Talking about money is half the battle because I feel like people who are scared to talk about money don't learn about money, right? Because they're not talking about it. So you're not exchanging information. How do you learn about something? You either read about it, you talk about it. So if you're not doing any of that when it comes to your finances, you're not learning. You're not getting better with it. So start talking about it. And that brings me to something that's been on my mind for a while now. People ask me, Alex, how did you go from a broke immigrant making pizzas, minimum wage as an EMT to being a successful entrepreneur with multiple seven-figure businesses? It's not that I'm smarter than you. That's for sure. It's not that I went to the best school. I never even graduated college. So how did I do it? The truth is, you only get what you put into it, right? You only get out what you put in. I became obsessed with getting better with learning. I put in the work. I'm not more talented than you or smarter than you or anyone, but I'm disciplined. I'm committed to putting in the work because I know that if I work hard enough, something like my YouTube channel and my brand Forte series, I know that I'll see results. And that has proven to be true every single time. especially nowadays expect fast results with little effort, right? Especially the newer generation. But honestly, that's not going to get you anywhere. People think they deserve a high salary or a great life just because. Because there are so many videos online saying that you deserve the world, that you are enough, that you should ask for that raise, right? That you deserve a vacation. The moment you stop thinking that you deserve these things is the moment that you start working for them. Instead of just thinking that you deserve a promotion just for going into your job and doing it, how about you work for it and give your boss no option but to offer you a promotion? Not because you did your job because everyone does their job. That's what you're supposed to do. If you're not doing your job, you're going to get let go. Right? So not because you did your job. That's not not why you deserve that promotion. It's because you went above and beyond. No successful person. I know anyway, got there without years of grinding. So putting in the work now, even if it's for free, even if it goes unnoticed, you're posting videos every day on YouTube, getting 10 views, it's okay. It doesn't give you those instant results, but it will set you up for massive successes in the future. I mean, when you look at MrBeast, that's a great story. The dude has posted so many videos early on when he was 13, 14, no views. And look at him now. Before my channel grew, I was balancing a full-time job while scripting, filming, editing, and posting videos. I was hustling and getting these videos done at work in the office sometimes, at home sometimes at night like would not get any sleep or before work sometimes. I wake up at three in the morning and have to shoot a video and edit and then go to the gym and then go to work. I knew that I had to put in that time and honestly that's how you build the life that you want. You have to make some sacrifices up front right and then it starts to get better and better as the the efforts that you put in start to pay dividends. The truth You also have to find something that you love because it makes going all in so much easier. Don't listen to people saying, you know, relax, have fun all the time. You're in your 20s. Have a lot of fun. This is the time where you have fun. This is the time where you lock in and you get things done. Enjoy life. Make sure that you enjoy your youth. But are you going to have a better time at your 30s when you're set financially, when you have the freedom to travel anywhere you want? Or when you're working a job that you don't want making money in your 30s, you have to think about the future. And look, even with all the hustle, all the work and business of life, there's a special group of people that deserve extra love, extra attention from you. And that is lesson number seven, it's spend time with your loved ones. You have to spend time with them. Don't forget about the people who have been there from day one time with your family and close friends. It's not going to last forever. It's priceless. In my early 20s, I moved to LA while my family was on the East Coast. So that's a six hour flight for me, for you guys that don't know. I missed out on a lot. I missed out on birthdays, family dinners, all of those little moments. And I thought sacrificing everything, even close relationships for work, was the right move. But looking back, I was missing out on life. So yes, sacrifices need to be made, but try not to include your loved ones as a part of that. my best to see my family as often as possible. I'm headed to Brazil next week actually to see everyone. We organize a family reunion every single year. So I'm really excited to go back where to where I grew up, like to see my whole family, to see my dad. I mean, I'm extremely excited about that and I'm not going to be working. You can always make more money. You can always make more money, but you can't make more time. Once it's gone, it's gone. So just showing up isn't enough. By the way, you have to, you have to be present. distractions, make sure that it's actual quality time. So do me a favor, plant something this week with your family or your closest friends. And when you're with them, no phones, no distractions, be 100% present. Be there because trust me, these moments are going to mean the most to you when you look back and spending time with the people that you love. It's like a battery recharge. You're going to come back to your work with even more energy. I truly hope that this video helped you in some way. And if it did, subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " We talk a lot about accessories here on this channel, but really the accessory that I use the most is my phone. I use it to talk to my team. I use it to keep track of my to-do list. I use it to shoot photos, videos. I even edit all of my photos right here on my phone. I just upgraded to the new iPhone 16 Pro. I went with the same storage that I had on my last phone, 512 gigabytes because I pay for iCloud storage anyway, so this is all I need. And I went with the natural titanium. Last year I got the 15 Pro natural titanium for personal use. And then the 15 Pro in blue titanium for business. Now I'm probably not gonna upgrade my blue business phone until next year for a few reasons. And I'll tell you my personal thoughts about the new iPhone and whether or not I think it's worth the upgrade later in this video. Today I wanna show you how I use my phone on a daily basis to build my businesses, to grow my social media and to stay organized. This is such a powerful tool that we have at our disposal. So I try to squeeze everything that I can out of these phones. Let's start with some of the apps that will be really helpful to young entrepreneurs, content creators. These apps keep my businesses organized. And I'll start with Trello. Trello is this app that I started using in January of this year when I did a complete overhaul of my digital systems. Trello is greatly described themselves as the ultimate teamwork project management tool. Now, the way that we use it might be different from other people, but we like to use it to keep track of our social media content production. So when I go into it here, I mean, all of these videos that you see on my channel, first of all, they're extremely time consuming. And on average, six people work on each of these videos, like myself, a videographer, an editor, a graphic designer, my assistant, my content manager, it goes on and off. It goes through a lot of stages before it ever goes live on YouTube. So Trello helps me keep track of which stage each of the videos are in. So for example, we have one pillar of ideas, and we have ideas for gloomy videos, fashion videos, self-help, masculinity, et cetera. We go forward and pull that video into researching. From researching, we pull that video into scripting. From scripting then, it goes into shooting. As you can see, I'm shooting the what's on my iPhone 16 Pro video, and then it goes into editing. So as soon as I'm done shooting my video, I'm just gonna bring it to editing, and it goes right then and there. And then once it's done editing, we bring it to review on frame, and then ready to publish, so on and so forth. So this is really good for you guys if you want to keep track of your content. And this is just for my YouTube content, by the way. I have different boards for IG, TikTok, community posts, emails, right? Keeping track of the content progress is really important to me so that I can just go on to Trello and within seconds I know the status of my content. Now that I know where things are, which videos are being edited, what we're posting, et cetera, I go on to the next app to communicate with my team and for that we use Slack. Slack is an app where I can instantly reach my team on the go or at my desk. Now you might say you can do that via email, you can do that via text message, but emails are too slow. Text messages aren't organized. Slack lets you create different channels with specific people. So I have one for videos with my team members that work in that area, right? Or one for branding with those guys that work in branding. For example, if I click on design brand identity, we have a bunch of different photos and brand identity content here, just deciding where to take the brand next. I have a bunch of channels for my team at 40 series, like product development, launch strategy, so on and so forth. So honestly, It's an incredible app and I'm so glad that we use Slack now as opposed to WhatsApp, which is what we did before. And it just sounds so like old, so outdated, but it's just a lot more organized, has a lot more business capabilities over WhatsApp. Now I still use WhatsApp to talk to my family because they live overseas in Brazil, so that's all they use over there. But business is done on Slack. Of course, my favorite app at the moment is probably everyone's favorite app at the moment, and that is chat GPT. And you know, it's my favorite app today, but it'll probably end us all one day. Until then, we're gonna live it up, right? And we're gonna ask it things like, hey, I'm meeting a girl for dinner. She's a lawyer. What's a good joke I can tell to break the ice? How about this? Why don't lawyers play hide and seek? Because good luck hiding when everyone's looking for you. It's a lighthearted way to go, especially in a room really, really bad, really horrible. Thanks for that horrible joke. I use it every single day. It helps me with research, to get new product ideas for Forte, to get gift suggestions for someone's birthdays. I mean, this is epic. It's like having a virtual assistant, right? And it's only going to get better. To be honest, as much as I like the new phone, it's kind of the same as the previous one besides some small improvements here and there. What I'm looking forward to the most is the new Apple Intelligence, which is supposed to be coming out in the next few months. So I'm just excited to have have a legit virtual assistant who knows me, who helps me stay organized, helps me get things done. I mean, imagine just asking your phone to call the airline company to book or change a flight, right? Or asking my phone, hey, send my editors all the videos from my phone that I'm wearing a leather jacket in so they can use it in a video, right? I mean, this is just the beginning. I think there's so much more that's gonna happen from this besides just having it integrated into your phone but also within your home, right? You can ask it to do things just like Google Home or Alexa can do it now, but way more integrated and way better. So I'm really excited for the future of AI. I'm a nerd and techie when it comes to this. Let's move on to the next app here, because I could talk about chat, your PT and AI for days. Honestly, one of the best apps that you can use for self development is the school app. Now, I love this. I've been obsessed with this app lately because with this, you have access to communities all over the world. Anything from how to make money to anime communities to of course, a community for men who get together to improve themselves. We started this community not that long ago and we only let in guys who are serious about it. And we already have over 3,000 people who meet on Zoom or in person. It's so cool to see all of that content here every single day. I mean, you have guys asking for fashion tips, giving hairstyle advice, guys helping each other getting shape, make more money, get more dates. It's just so addicting to go into this app every day, pumps me up and motivates me to do better every single day. You should definitely join if that sounds like something that you would want. hit the first link in the description and you can use the app or you can just do it on your desktop. The community is called Men's Image Lab and it's open today. Besides that, I also use Notion. I'm sure you guys have heard of Notion before if you haven't used it yet, but it's basically to keep track of my to-do lists, especially shared to-do lists. For example, that's where I have a list of projects for my executive assistant. She can go in there, she can go see what she needs to do. She can have different pages for different projects. She actually built out the whole thing because I'm not gonna lie, Notion's kind of hard to learn at first to build the page, but once it's done, it gets a lot easier. So, I mean, you can see here, we have everything from data asset management, brand hub, control panel, you know, to my New York optometrist and restaurants and niece, she was helping me get reservations while I was out there. I mean, there's just so much that you can do with Notion. It's extremely customizable and that's what I love the most about it, but also that's what makes it really difficult to use at first. And learning curve is kind of tough, but once you get it, it's really, really helpful. As a young entrepreneur nowadays, you have to learn how to use these apps to your advantage, these services. You have Asana, Notion, Workday, Trello, Slack, Glue. There are so many apps out there that are extremely helpful and they're gonna help you just propel yourself to the next level, right? Why not use this? This is the best tool at your disposal. So Notion is absolutely incredible. They just came out with a new AI tool that I haven't used yet, but so far I've been loving using it and my assistant keeps track of everything through there. so highly, highly recommended. I mean, besides that, I also definitely use notes. I'm not gonna open my notes app here because there's definitely a lot of just thoughts and brain dumps into my notes app. I probably use it way too much. I have thousands and thousands of notes. I keep just journal. I write random thoughts. I take notes when I'm listening to audiobook. Anytime that I'm somewhere and somebody says something, a quote that I wanna remember for later, I take notes there. I write some of my scripts for these videos on notes while I'm on the go. I mean, notes, I know it comes standard on the iPhone but it's extremely, extremely helpful. So I use it all the time. Another app that I've talked about a lot here on the channel is Woop and it's still one of my favorite apps on my phone. If you follow me for a while, then you know that I've worn a Woop, which is a fitness tracker habit on my bicep right now for like three years, or maybe over three years now. I mean, it's absolutely incredible. It just tells you how you slept. I got seven hours and 47 minutes of sleep, which is pretty good. I mean, I woke up at seven o'clock today, which is a little later than usual, went to bed at 10, 16. Right, I mean, I'm really trying to be healthy in the best way possible here. So I worked out today, this was my workout. I did eight exercises, 16 sets total. It was a 40 minute workout, quick one today. This is really good date. I love waking up and seeing all of this data on my loop. I also have a link for a free loop if you wanna get it, so you just pay the subscription. You don't have to pay for the device and I'll link that in the description below. Now something you guys might have noticed on my phone is this Duolingo app. And I speak Portuguese, but I don't speak Spanish. My Spanish is pretty low, but they're kind of similar, right? So I wanna be good in Spanish. Necesito aprender español. Yo hablo portugués, pero no es lo mismo. So I wanna learn Duolingo, it's great for that. Just getting me over the hump, so I can feel more confident when I'm speaking to someone in Spanish. An app that I use every single day without fail is frame.io, and this is an absolutely incredible app you guys if you do any sort of video content, right? So I mean, I have all of these are all my editors and they have different edits in here so you can click on them and then you can see this is the video, this is what it looks like. And what I absolutely love about frame.io is that I can go into one of my videos, I can click on it and then if there's any mistakes or anything that I want to change in the video, creative wise, I can just literally tap onto it like this. Then I can just go in here and I can just say crop in here and send it, right? Boom. Now my editor gets that notification and he knows exactly what to do with the video. I mean, this is extremely, extremely helpful. It saves us a lot of time just back and forth communicating with our editors. We don't have to hop on a call. We don't have to send a Slack message. We just put it into frame. They get the notification and then we just send them, hey, we did all of the notes for this video, go through all of the edits and send us the final version, right? And then we get the final version. We look at it one more time. If there's any little mistakes, we can send more notes, so on and so forth. So it really cuts a lot of time from that back and forth with your editors. If you do any video content and if you have a remote team next, right next to frame here, we have my Shopify app, we have the Amazon seller, and then we have the seller central central for TikTok. I mean, these are apps that I use all the time as well. I'm not going to go into them, but basically these apps are for Forte series, my men's grooming line. So this is where I keep track of all of our sales, all of our products, all of our launches. These are apps that I use all the time. Let me give you my thoughts on the new iPhone because I know that a lot of you are contemplating upgrading to the new iPhone. So I got the 16 Pro. This is not the max, it's the 16 Pro, natural titanium, 512 gigabytes. And honestly, there's really no major difference until I think Apple intelligence comes out. The camera is amazing, right? And I use it all the time, so it is really, really good. The case, by the way, is from ARK. I really like the case. I think it's cool. I hope it protects my phone, if it falls. And I do like that you can customize the app so I can just hold here, edit, and then customize. And then I can just do tinted, choose a color that I want and basically just change the colors of all of my apps. I actually like to keep it into this dark mode, which makes it look pretty cool. I think it's pretty sleek. But honestly, are you gonna pay to upgrade your phone just because of little things like that? I don't think so. Camera's amazing. I will say the extra button on the side here is actually kind of annoying. It gets in the way once in a while and it's not very intuitive. It's a little bit hard to use. I upgrade my phone every year. I like having the latest tech. I need my phone for content, for business, so I want the best, the newest. But I think it's pretty obvious that unless you have an iPhone 12 or 13, there's really no major reason to upgrade your phone right now. I'd actually wait until the 17 comes out next year, which is supposed to be a much bigger leap in technology and a change in design, but we'll wait and see.

        "transcript": " First impressions matter, whether you're stepping into a boardroom, meeting clients or managing a team, the way that you present yourself speaks volume. Sure. The world has become more casual, right? And a messy hairstyle might fly if you're an artist or if you don't meet with clients, but in most professional settings, our sharp, well-groomed hairstyle shows more than just good grooming. It shows that you pay attention to detail and let's be real. That's exactly what you want people to think about when you think about you. Because if you can handle the small details like a clean cut look, a pressed shirt, a polished appearance, people will trust you to handle the big things too. So in this video, I'm going to show you some of the best hairstyles for men in professional settings, whether you're working in a corporate office, running your own business or anything in between. And these hairstyles are classic, clean, easy to maintain. Now even tell you how to style each one so that by the end of the video, you're going to know exactly how to look your absolute best at work. And if you think that your appearance doesn't matter much at work, then think again because studies show that how you present yourself can directly impact your earning potential. In fact, research from Yale University found that well-groomed professionals are perceived as more competent and they can earn up to 13% more annually than those who neglect their appearance. So yeah, your hairstyle can actually help you pay the bills. And by no means does a professional hairstyle mean boring, by the way, it actually means classic. Ryan Reynolds is a great example of proof of why a classic hairstyle stays classic. Sure, he's changed his hairstyle slightly to more shaggy and buzz cuts once in a blue moon, but he almost always has that cropped gentleman's hairstyle. And here, he might let the sides grow out a little bit, but still keeps it tidy with scissor cut. Then he alternates that with clippers, right? Tight sides, which is his go-to look. That's called the crew cut. The crew cut is a classic low maintenance hairstyle that looks great in professional settings. It's clean, it's sharp, and it works for just about any face shape. So that's why it's so popular. And that's why it's never gonna go out of style. Notice how the sides are short, but not as tight as a bus cut. While the top is slightly longer, giving you some flexibility on how to style. So you can personalize it, right? You can customize it, change it up a little bit. Some guys might even want more volume. Some want a comb to the side, others want to go up and over. The length of top is just long enough to give that hairstyle some nice texture and some nice personalization that you can change it up once in a while. Now the crew cut is perfect for the guy who wants a sharp, clean look, without the need to spend a ton of time styling it every day. It's efficient, but it still looks good and stylish. And to style it, it's extremely easy. What you don't want is a flat crew cut. Flat hair looks boring. It looks like it's not styled properly. So use texture clay to add volume, to add hold and texture to the top. It'll give your hair some definition, but it has that matte finish. It's not shiny. That way you're gonna look fresh, but not overly styled. That's the secret. I'm gonna link all of the products that I mentioned in the description below. Next up, if you have curly hair, then you're in luck because curly hair stands out. It looks great, but only when styled right. And if you're in a professional setting, going for a short curly hairstyle with clean sides is a solid choice. Why? Because it keeps your curls looking fresh and controlled while still showing off that amazing natural texture. Think Michael B. Jordan. His short curly hairstyle looks great. It's polished, it's professional, and it's definitely not boring. And what you want to do is keep the curls at a manageable length up top. You need enough length to get that nice texture, then keep the sides tapered or faded. Because the short sides, it makes the hairstyle look sharp, it makes it look tidy. And the curly texture up top, it adds personality to your look without going overboard. To achieve it, you don't want a heavy product here. To style short curls, I definitely recommend using the Forte Cievi Styling Cream. It's really lightweight, it enhances that natural curl pattern, and it has really good hold without weighing your hair down. You want something light. It leaves your curls looking natural, healthy, not stiff or crunchy. Just apply a small amount to damp hair and use your fingers to shape the curls. Just kind of scrunch your hair up top and there you go, that's easy. That way your hair looks intentional, but effortless, right? Perfect for the office. Okay, next up, let's talk about one of the most popular hairstyles for professionals. One of my favorites, the Quiff. This is the hairstyle for the guy who wants to make a statement without being too flashy. Now, a properly styled Quiff, it gives you a modern, polished look that stands out in a good way, right? Think David Beckham, think Zach Efron. Those guys have been rocking the Quiff for years and it's a go-to hairstyle for a good reason. The Quiff combines the short sides with a longer top and because you have that longer hair up top, then you can add volume, add texture by just sweeping the hair up and back. If you're a long-time subscriber, then you know that the Quiff was just like my go-to hairstyle for the longest time way back in the day. And the reason why I like this haircut so much is because you can style it in so many different ways, right? One haircut doesn't always mean one hairstyle. It's versatile. It makes it a great hairstyle because of that versatility. For professionals, they can just keep it sleek and pushed back for a more formal day in the office. But if you want to give it a little bit more texture, a little bit more flow, a little bit more fun, right? Then you can go for a modern, fun, casual look. It's the same exact haircut, but it's a different hairstyle. Now to style the quiff, there's one hack that makes all the difference. Using a thickening spray on wet hair before you style it. So get out of the shower, right? Spray the sun when your hair is wet. Then styled your hair and then finished it with the molding paste for medium hold or the texture clay for high hold. The thickening spray just adds volume, it adds thickness to your hair and that's a big feature of a good quiff. Now look, when you think of professional hairstyles, you might not immediately think of longer hair, right? But if you look at guys like Bradley Cooper who has longer hair and movies like Limitless, one of my favorite movies, Jake Gyllenhaal also lets his hair grow all the time. Those guys have mastered this brushed back longer hairstyle and he goes to show that medium length hair can look polished and well put together while still having that cool, relaxed flow. Right? It's definitely not boring. For this hairstyle, you're going to need to keep your hair longer on top, slightly shorter on the sides. It's a scissor cut, so no clippers. It's honestly kind of what I have going on right now, but mine is just overgrown. I haven't cut it in maybe a couple of months. And what makes this hairstyle professional is how you control it. Brushing it back gives you that sleek, well put together style, but you still have the length to keep it more casual or more flowy whenever you want to do that. To style it, you're going to want to use a product that gives your hair some hold, but also allows for movement. Nothing too stiff or that's going to look really bad. So the styling cream is ideal for this one. It's the only one in the white jar and it's made for flowy hairstyles. It's what I'm using right now. It's made with biotin, aloe vera, olive oil and argan oil, which is going to make your hair feel really nice on top of looking great, which you kind of need for longer hair. It needs to be healthy. So apply it to your hair, brush it back with a comb or your fingers and the result is a brushed back hairstyle that looks professional but still has character. This next hairstyle is a timeless classic and it's one of those hairstyles that will never ever go out of style especially for professionals the tried and true side part. Cool and stylish isn't really the first thing that comes to mind when you think of a side part. But if you look at Ryan Gosling in Crazy Stupid Love, right, the man knows how to rock a side part in a way that's still cool, it's still modern even though it's the oldest hairstyle in the book. It's maybe the most professional hairstyle that you could ever have. It's all about precision. It has a clean traditional aesthetic that's perfect for the office. It's sharp. It's elegant. It's easy to pull off no matter what your hair type is. And the side part works best when the sides are shorter, either tapered or faded, with more length up top to create that nice contrast. The top should be either brushed to the side or combed backwards depending on how former you want to go. And to achieve a side part, honestly, it's probably the easiest hairstyle to ever style. You can go for the styling cream, the moldy paste, or the texture clay, depending on how much hold you want. All of those products don't have shine, so you're gonna have that matte finish, which I personally prefer. I don't like the really greasy, wet look. One thing I'm gonna say about the side part is try not to style it too flat. Add some lift, some volume to your hair, because that tends to make it look a little bit better. But of course, I understand the side part might be a little bit too simple for you, where maybe you've tried it before, you've had it for the majority of your life and you want to try something new. The majority of guys have tried a side part. So let's say you have curly hair and you want to try something a little bit different, something slightly edgy but still professional. The curly french crop is the way to go. This is a trendy hairstyle right? The professionals still style it like that because it became really popular recently. It's a low maintenance hairstyle. It's still stylish. It has the short sides, a textured slightly longer top with curls left natural and the curls kind of fall forward towards your forehead. Now what's great about the French crop is that it gives you that effortless cool vibe while still looking polished enough for the office. It's perfect for guys who want to keep the curls under control but still show them off because curls are cool. For styling, you're going to use three to four sprays of the Forte series sea salt spray to enhance the curls while keeping them in place. And this is going to add definition without making your hair look way too done up. It's a quick, easy way to look polished without spending a ton of time on your hair.

It takes one second of your time and it really helps me continue to post these videos here for you to watch for free. Now I've been doing this for over a decade now and I really appreciate your support over all of these years. It means a lot to me. The next hairstyle has a really cool name. It's called the Ivy League, which as the name says, it's a classic hairstyle that gives you a preppy look. It's perfect for professional environments, right? It's essentially a longer version of the Kruka with short sides and a little bit more length up top to allow for some styling flexibility. Think George Clooney in his earlier roles, Zach Efron once in a while, he has a similar hairstyle. Now the great thing about the Ivy League is its versatility. You can part it to the side for a polished professional look, you can sweep it back for something more relaxed, it's a smart, sophisticated style, and it says that you're put together and ready for business. Like this is a really professional hairstyle that looks great. To style the Ivy League, I recommend using the Molding Paste because it has medium hold with matte finish. It gives you that classic but really reliable look. Just work a small amount into your damp or dry hair, comb it into place, and you're all set for the day. It's super easy. Of course, we can't talk about professional hairstyles without mentioning the one and only Buzzcut. This is the ultimate low maintenance haircut, right? It's perfect for guys who don't wanna spend time in front of the mirror, who don't really wanna do anything. Just wake up and look handsome. It works, right? But you're still gonna look sharp, you're still gonna look professional, it's just easy. It's clean, it's simple, but it's masculine. Think Idris Elba, Jason Statham, Jamie Foxx, Chris Evans. There's no fuss, just straight up business, straight up masculinity, it's by far the manliest of haircuts. And the bus cut is great because it's timeless, it always looks sharp. It's perfect for guys with strong facial features because it highlights the face. So if you have a strong jaw, if you have high cheekbones, Those are gonna pop when you have a buzz cut, right? The key here is to keep it clean, meaning regular trims. You can't let it be kind of in that awkward stage and it gets there quick. So you need to maintain that fresh, professional look. And for a buzz cut, you don't need any product, right? Basically all you have to do is keep your hair healthy, keep your scalp healthy. It's the easiest hairstyle to achieve. If you're confused about which hair products to use and what the difference is between a clay, a palm made, a gel, a paste, I know there's a lot of hair products out there. I posted a video there that they explaining each of those products in detail to help you. I'm gonna link it right here. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Looking attractive is easy. Seriously, you don't need a ton of crazy products or an overwhelming routine. It really comes down to three main areas plus one secret that I call the X factor. I've been talking about men's style for years now and it still surprises me how many guys overlook this X factor. And by the end of this video, not only will you know exactly what it is, but you will have a simple game plan to boost your looks by at least two to three points with a few small changes. Now let's dive into the first area and trust me, this one is basically a cheat code to look more attractive. Once you get this dialed in, half of your problems are solved. You're going to feel better, look better, have more energy and women love it. Even your friends might give you a bit of side-eye out of jealousy. So what is area number one? Well, it's all about self-image and that breaks down into three main parts. First, your physique. Second, your style. And third, your You're grooming. Let's break these down one by one starting with your physique. Look, if you think just hitting the gym is enough, you're missing the bigger picture here. Your body is like a sports car. It needs proper care. Here's the breakdown. First, you need fuel. Just like a sports car needs quality gas, your body runs best on quality food. Ditch the junk food and aim for protein, veggies and healthy carbs. Hydration is key too. Your body is 60% water. Remember that. So staying hydrated is like keeping your car oiled up and ready to go. Even maintenance. Just like a car needs tune-ups, your body needs regular exercise. Aim for three to four workouts a week. Strength training, cardio, flexibility. Even a 20 minute walk can make a difference. Trust me, it's not about being shredded or jacked. It's about feeling confident and looking great. And finally, recharge is number three. You wouldn't drive a car full throttle 24-7. Your body's the same. Sleep is when your body repairs and grows stronger. So aim for 7 to 8 hours a night and track your sleep with something like a whoop or aura because those are game changers and data is always good. But here's the deal, even if you're in the best shape of your life, if you mess up this next part, it won't matter. I've seen so many guys sabotage their looks without even realizing it and because of that, they never reach their full potential. This happens when guys just completely ignore the second part of appearance and that style. Think of style as the body of your car. It's what people notice, it's what they see. So to lock in great first impressions, you need to follow these four steps. First, find your model. Look for someone who's style you like and think it might work for you. Follow them on social media, take screenshots of their looks, save them on a folder. I used to do this all the time, I still do. Then start copying their outfits. Quick tip, use Google Lens or Pinterest to find exactly where they bought their pieces. Second, you need to declutter and be ruthless with your wardrobe. Toss out anything that's worn out, toss out anything that doesn't fit or anything that you haven't worn in over six months, ditch those pieces that you don't wear because you need to make room for things that you will actually wear. And then build your go-to closet. Fill your closet with high quality, versatile pieces that you can mix and match easily. This way, you're always gonna have outfit options without overthinking it. Now, when you're shopping, here are the 10 must-have items that every guy needs to have in his closet. A solid pair of jeans, basic teas or polos, sweaters or a cardigan for layering, a couple of button downs, a mix of smart and casual pants, a versatile jacket, sneakers, smart shoes or boots, at least one great fitting suit and accessories like a watch, sunglasses, and a belt. Now there's no need to drop a ton of cash to build this wardrobe right away. You can wait until the end of the season for sales, right? You can use a site like dupe.com to find budget-friendly alternatives that still look really good. Or you can even wait for Black Friday sales, which is coming up. I know, it's crazy. We're coming towards the end of the year already. I can't even believe it. Once you have the essentials, then color coordination is where most guys go wrong. They just don't know how to mix and match things, but there's an easy fix in the few quick tricks that I can teach you. For example, stick to earth tones like brown, black, white, tan, or monochromatic looks like black, white, gray, make it easy to mix and match and you're all set. Now my go-to hack for this is the LMD, light, medium, dark. Just wear one of each and you're gonna have a great outfit. It's super easy. Or another hack I mentioned recently in a video, and you guys really liked it, the sandwich method. Just match your top and your shoes with a contrasting middle piece, just like a sandwich, and it makes it really easy to put outfits together. But there's one more detail that you can't forget when it comes to self-image, and that is grooming. You can have the best outfit, the best physique, but if you're not well groomed, it's like driving a Ferrari covered in mud. It won't matter. Grooming doesn't have to be complicated either. The first step is finding the right hairstyle. Hair, like I've said this before, it's like makeup for men. Get the right cut and your whole look levels up. Try to get regular haircuts every three to six weeks. Bring pictures to your barber. Experiment until you find the hairstyle that makes you feel confident, that makes you look your best. Having a great hairstyle is so important for your overall look. And I know a lot of guys watching this are starting to thin. I know because I get so many messages from guys who are losing hair and just don't know what to do. Now the good thing about Livian 2024 is that you have options. You don't have to just watch your hair fall out. You can stop it. There's a brand started by Dr. Gary Linkov who's a facial plastics and hair surgeon and it's called Fuel Confident and they have anti hair loss products like topical drops that you can just massage onto your scalp like finasteride and minoxidil. And you can just apply that to your problem areas. It's proven to help increase hair growth and to slow down hair loss on the scalp. They sponsored today's video so I could tell you about this But as you know, I've actually been using finasteride and minoxidil for about a year and a half now. And basically as soon as I started noticing my hair thinning, I got on it because it's easy, it's affordable, and it's effective. If you're thinning, the last thing you want is to wait too long because the more hair you lose, the harder it's going to be to get back to a full head of hair. So don't wait until it's too late because it will be too late. And the other part of grooming is your skincare, right? You have to develop a skincare routine to keep your skin looking clear with no pimples, no wrinkles. And it can be simple. Sometimes men get overwhelmed by all of these crazy products. There's no need for all of that. Wash your face with a facial cleanser like this one from Feel Confident. That's gonna prevent bacteria from building up on your face and then pimples from acting up. Then the HA serum, which will immediately make your skin feel better and then finish off with the moisturizer to hydrate your skin. The products look great, they feel great and they work. And of course I got you guys a discount code, just use alexkosta at checkout for 10% off your order. By the way, they even have a newsletter that teaches you about hair care and skincare, so make sure to check that out as well. Now that we've covered why looks matter, here's the reality. Looks, they're gonna get you through the door, but they're only gonna get you so far. They're gonna get you that first date or first impression, but then what? This is when the next part comes in. Area number two is of course your personality. And this is way more important for keeping attraction long term to make sure that people remember you. Think about it, I'm sure you've met someone who was really attractive at first, right? But then as soon as they started talking, you completely lost interest or the opposite. There's always that guy who might not be the best looking, but he's always making people laugh. He's surrounded by cool people and great opportunities and women are really into him and that's the power of personality. It's what lets you build real connections with people, making them want to be around you. It's what lets you create influence in both your personal and professional life. It keeps relationships exciting and meaningful over time. It helps you stand out, even in a room full of good looking people. It builds confidence that comes from within. Trust me, the list goes on and on. There are so many benefits for having a great personality. A lot of advice out there about personality, it's kind of fluffy, right? But I want to make it practical for you. So let's break it down in three steps. First, you need to start with building confidence because without confidence, nothing else holds up. This should be your number one focus and priority. And to build confidence, it is really only one thing that works and that is knowledge. And I'm going to give you an example. If you asked a mechanic, and let's say he's never worn a suit in his life, to give a speech about the rules of wearing a suit, he's just not going to know what to say. He's definitely not going to be confident, right? But if you ask him to give a speech right now about car mechanics, he doesn't have to prep. He's confident in what he's saying because he has the knowledge. He understands cars. If you want to be confident, you need to put in the work. You need to learn about specific topics that you can easily talk about. This only works if you take action, right? If you push yourself out of your comfort zone, try something new, a random class, join a team, dive into a hobby that you've been really curious about. Every little challenge that you take on is a win for your knowledge base and your confidence. So you slowly push yourself out of your comfort zone. And with each small step, you're gonna prove to yourself that you can actually handle those challenges. Then step two is to get used to feeling awkward in social situations, get comfortable with discomfort. For example, talking to strangers or jumping into deep conversations with someone you just met, it's gonna get easier, right? Over time, you're gonna be the guy who can handle any conversations like it's nothing. And finally, step three is to surround yourself with positive influences, and this one is really important. Cut out the toxic people, the toxic media in your life, and instead, stay close to confident friends and content that inspires you, that challenges you. That energy is what you need to fuel your growth. And if you do take these three steps seriously, there's no way that you're not gonna feel more confident. It's all about putting in the work and getting a little bit better every single day. Now the last pieces of the puzzle, when it comes to having a magnetic personality, are first, active listening. Don't just wait for your turn to speak, right? Just talk, talk, talk. Actively hear what the other person is saying. This opens up deeper conversations, deeper connections, and builds trust, which is one of the most powerful things when it comes to standing out in a crowd. Then practice positivity because look, no one likes a negative person. So keep it light, keep it fun. A quick hack is to make an effort to smile more. Seriously, it's so simple. Just a simple smile can change the energy of a room and draw people to you naturally. And look, I know that building a great personality just doesn't happen overnight, but if you stick with it over time, you're gonna start to attract people like you never have before. Now you might be thinking, all right, I've got the looks, I got the personality down, so I'm good. But hold up, there's one more thing that ties this all together. And it's a secret sauce that sets you apart. Now, you know those guys who just have that? Something, something about them, the aura. Women can't help to be drawn to them. People want to be around these guys, right? But no one can really explain why. That's what I call the X factor. Now, the X factor is the final piece of the puzzle. It's so powerful, but it's actually so misunderstood. And surprisingly, not a lot of people talk about it. Now to unlock that X factor, you're gonna have to tap into your masculine archetype. And I know it sounds weird, but don't worry. It's not as complicated as it sounds. Psychologists say that there are four main types of guys. I'm gonna break them down for you real quick. First, the king. Think guys who are natural leaders, Black Panther, for example, right? The ones who make tough decisions for the greater good. Second, the warrior. Guys like the Rock or Bruce Lee, They're all about strength and discipline and courage. Third, the magician. This is your Elon Musk or Tony Stark. They're innovators. They're the ones pushing boundaries with new ideas. And fourth, the lover. Think Bruno Mars or Drake, right? Emotional, passionate guys who can connect with people's hearts. Immediately you should know which one of the four you fit into, but it's also really good to be well-rounded. So you're not overly emotional as a lover or overly aggressive as a warrior, but figure out which archetype feels the most like you and then own it, lean into it. The big mistake a lot of guys make is trying to be something they're not, imagine a lover trying to act all tough, like a warrior, just because he thinks that that's what women want. It's like watching Romeo try to be Tony Montana, it just doesn't work, right? Because look, at the end of the day, being attractive isn't about changing who you are completely. It's about becoming the best version of yourself, best version that you can be. It's still you. That's what creates the X factor that people can't resist. Nobody combined that with your appearance and your personality, the transformation will be massive. And if you want to keep it going, I highly recommend you watch this special video right here. Thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " If you look up men's fashion trends on GQ, Vogue, or any of these other popular media companies, they're going to tell you to wear things like this, or this, or this. Honestly, I don't even know how they're still in business at this point. Forget everything they're telling you to wear. My goal with this video is to give you a list of items that you will actually wear in the real world and not look like a cloud. Starting with one of my favorite pieces, something that you can wear immediately. Today, in those cooler nights, suede jackets. I've worn suede jackets for years, but they're even more popular now and I know suede sounds a little fancy, but it's actually one of the best materials for fall. It has this rich luxurious feel that instantly upgrades your outfit. It makes you look more expensive even if you're wearing faux suede, which is affordable. And what I like the most about suede jackets is that they have this masculine appeal to them. It makes you look elegant and high-end. Now the key with suede is to choose a neutral color like gray, brown or navy because it makes it easy to match with almost anything in your closet and it will make sure that you get the most wear out of your jacket. Brands that I like for suede or faux suede jackets are Reese, Bonanno Republic, Mr. Porter, which are all a bit pricier. Quincy has really nice ones that are a little bit easier on your wallet and if you want even more affordable options you can go faux suede from fast fashion brands like Zara, H&M, Mango, they're gonna have some really good options there and you might think that they're hard to style but they're more versatile than you imagine. You can wear them with jeans and a t-shirt for a casual look or you can throw them over a polo and formal pants for a more polished outfit. Moving on to long sleeve polos. Just because summer is over doesn't mean that you have to stop wearing polos. As a matter of fact, I think the best polos are made for the fall season. There are two differences between summer and fall polos. One is the fabric. Polos for fall are made of a heavier fabric like wool, cashmere, knit polos which are too warm for summer, right, but perfect for fall. And the second thing, the second difference is the sleeve length. So in the colder months, you can switch up to long sleeve polos to keep you warm. I also really like the look of the long sleeve polos because it's clean, it's classy, it looks really nice. Now you can wear these polos under a jacket, a quarter zip sweater, or just on their own. It's one of those versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down and it's become a staple in my closet as you can see. I barely wear t-shirts anymore because I personally just love the look of a nice polo. that I recommend are Suitsupply, which by the way Suitsupply is on fire right now with their new collection. Todd Snyder has some amazing polos and Reese has some of my favorite Merino wool polos. By the way, I'm listing and linking everything that I'm talking about in this video in the description to make it easy for you. Okay, so one of the best parts about fall fashion is that you can finally wear layers. Another layer on top of a usual t-shirt or your usual polo outfit, right? One of the most stylish way to do that is by wearing a quarter zip sweater. Now, quarter zips can be more sporty and casual like this one here from a million door that I just got. I love it. It looks really good. I can wear it with jeans or dress it up with more formal pants, but it's not as dressy as this one from Lorenzo Uomo, which is more dressy. It has that classic style that I really like. Even the leather pull tab here, just as that detail, right? It just elevates the look from a basic sweater and it's practical because you you can adjust the zipper based on the weather. And you can layer it over a colored shirt to get this classy dressed up look. This one is cashmere by the way, which is known for being this crazy soft, warm and durable fabric. And you can find these everywhere, from Theory to Ralph Lauren, right? Charles Triwitt has a few colors too. My favorite one being the ivory white. It looks really, really clean. Now something else that every guy needs is a nice watch. And I'm sure you've noticed this one, it's kind of hard to miss. This is a beauty. It's a chronograph 001 from Aura Watches. They're partners of the channel. And the first thing I noticed when I got my first watch from Aura is the weight. Like these are heavy. Sometimes you buy a watch online and it looks really good, they have nice photos. And when you get it, it looks and feels cheap. This isn't that. These are made to look, feel and function like a luxury timepiece, but without that crazy high price tag that you're gonna pay for a big name brand, right? Specifically this one I'm wearing goes for $275, but of course, you're not gonna pay full price for it because you're a member of our YouTube family. So you get 30% off your entire order with no limit on how many you can buy. With the discount, this one actually goes for $192. That's such a great price for a good-looking watch that's stylish and that you can wear for a long time because it's not a trendy type of watch. It's got a classic shape. It's a chronograph. It's always gonna look good. They come in this soft travel case to keep them safe. And when you go on their website, you're gonna see they have a ton of other watch options. Different dials, automatic or quartz movements, rubber or stainless steel straps. Now my favorites are the chronograph 001 in a black dial that I'm wearing right now. And I really like the date 001 in a white dial. You really can't go wrong with those. Just check out aura.watch slash alexcosta and use the code alexcosta to get 30% off your entire order with no limit. Now fall as you know is sweater, weather, and there's nothing like a good sweater to keep you warm and stylish. It's a wardrobe staple for the colder season. And I personally love sweaters, especially the ones that have some type of texture to them, like this one here from Quincy. I mean, the simple heritage sweater from J. Crew is also a really great option. If you want something more simple and straightforward, these ones from Charles Triwitt look great and they're not bad on the wallet either. And if you want even more texture, you can wear a cable knit sweater like this one here from J. Crew or this one here from Raw Florin. and these are gonna look great on any guy. So if you've never worn a textured sweater before, this is your sign to get one, to give it a shot, and they can be layered in so many different ways. I mean, you can't go wrong with them. You can even throw the sweater over your shoulder for a smart, casual look. They're so versatile. Every man needs to have a couple of good sweaters for fall. Moving on to the next item, if someone told me three years ago that I would love wearing cardigans, I wouldn't even believe them. But the truth is, I do. They've really become a staple for fall. Like I wore these from Mango all of last year and I'm gonna do the same this year. A cardigan is great because it's one of those pieces that you can easily just throw over anything. You can wear them with a tank top for a more laid back look which I've done a ton. You can wear them over a t-shirt or even a button up shirt underneath if that's more of your style. If you're getting your first cardigan, go for black, brown or navy. These are the easiest to style and then once you dip your toes, then you can go crazy, right? Like I got this one from Amelie on Door last year. It's obviously not something that I wear all the time. I barely wear it, but when I do, people always compliment it. So then you can have a little bit more fun. Next on the list, wool pants are an absolute must have for fall because they're warm. They're comfortable. They look incredibly sharp. I swear, I wear these from Suitsupply more than anything in my closet right now. I love the way they feel. I love the way they look. Honestly, I want them in every single color and I'm holding back because I really shouldn't do that, but I really want to. And here's the truth. A lot of guys get stuck wearing only jeans or only chinos or just jeans and chinos. So this is a huge upgrade. It's going to make you stand out. It's going to make you look way more stylish and put together than those other guys who don't have the balls to try something new. The key here though is to find a pair that fits you well. Look for tapered or straight fit. You definitely don't want to go skinny or baggy because this is more of a tailored classy look. Right? So you need a tailored fit to match that energy. You could also go for flannel pants. They're pretty similar and Todd Snyder makes these absolutely beautiful flannel pants. Todd Snyder by the way is another one of those brands that's just killing it right now. Every time I go on their website they just take all of my money and for good reason. They're absolutely crushing it with their designs. And something that would go really well with any of these items that we talked about today, something that I've been wearing a lot, almost exclusively loafers. Not just any loafers, specifically chunky loafers for fall. Those look really good because you can wear them with thicker socks if it's cold outside. You can wear them when it's raining or just a little bit wet outside. So any type of environment or weather, they're good for that. Miner from Tod's, man, I've broken these in. These are worn in. I've been wearing these exclusively almost. But you can also find more affordable options at Blackstock and Weber. These are absolutely beautiful. I'm probably going to pick these up, actually. And then these from ASOS. ASOS has a ton of options. You can just go to ASOS and look for loafers and you're going to see a ton of amazing, incredible options that are pretty affordable. And I think a lot of guys are against wearing loafers just because they think they really have to dress up to match the loafers, but you really don't. The cool thing about loafers is that even if you're wearing jeans, the loafers will actually dress up the jeans. So instead of dressing up to match the loafers, the loafers would dress up your casual outfit if you know what I mean. So give it a shot. Even if you start with something casual, I think guys are missing out on a huge opportunity to just look a little bit different from every guy out there wearing Air Force ones. guy out there who's wearing Yeezys. It's time to change it up. And one of my favorite things about the changing season has to be of course fragrances, right? I mean especially fall. You can start wearing richer, deeper scents instead of light summer fragrances. I love that. I mean fragrances, they just completely change your entire aura. So I'm a fan of notes like tobacco. I'm a fan of notes like amber, incense, but they're too heavy for the hot summer weather, which is perfect for fall. So fall was the perfect time for you to kind of put aside all of those fresh blue scents, right, those powdery clean scents and go for something a little bit heavier with a little bit more edge to it, right. Centaurus from Creed just came out. It's an absolutely beautiful fragrance. I highly recommend it. I'm wearing it right now. It smells incredible. Tom Ford, O'Donbray leather, which is like a new take on one of my favorite fragrances of all time, which is Tom Ford ombre leather just came out as well incredible scent and then autumn vibes by replica I mean the name says it all right. It's clearly a fall fragrance if you made it to the end Don't forget to subscribe and drop me a comment letting me know what you're gonna be wearing this fall and I'll see you in the next video"

        "transcript": " My favorite time of the year is finally here, fall in New York City. And you know what that means. We can finally wear layers again. Today I'm gonna show you a few fall outfits any guy can pull off. I'm gonna keep it classy. Think old money with a modern twist. I'm wearing a Reno wool polo from Reese. It's short sleeve, but the wool fabric is perfect for transitional outfit like this. I prefer polos that are buttonless. It keeps the collar looking clean. And if it gets cold, I can just throw on the sweater that I picked up from J.Crew. I like the shoulder seam detail. And it's a nice accessory over your shoulder too, because it's in the same earth tones as the rest of the outfit. The pants are from Theory, also made from wool. I really like the deep, rich brown. It makes it easy to style with other earth tones, and they're soft and comfortable. I've been trying to find the perfect brown loafers for a while. I wanted them to be a little bit chunkier, so they were hard to find. The other day I went shopping and I found these beautiful Travis Swach loafers by Laura Piana. And I just had to bring him home. The quality is as you would expect from Loro Piana. They're second to none. They match this outfit perfectly and the soles are thicker, which is perfect for fall. The sunglasses are from Zenyir. I just got them. I really like the detail around the lenses. It just pops and adds a nice detail to the sunglasses. The watch is one of my favorites, a Cartier Tainc Louis in gold. To be honest, I had a hard time not wearing this watch with every outfit in this video. It's such a beauty. But don't worry, I didn't. I have different watches for each outfit and I think you're gonna like them. This next outfit, I swear any guy can pull off. It's simple, but it's classy and elegant. This is probably the most comfortable one from this video. The half-zip polo from Reese feels luxurious. It's made of fuzzy wool. The zipper has a leather pull tab which makes it look more high-end. And the rib pattern adds a nice touch to the outfit. The pants are from Club Monaco. I really like the toned down colorway. It makes it easy to mix and match with pretty much anything I want. The sunglasses are from Solt Optic. I like the whiskey color. They might be my favorite pair of sunglasses right now, or at least the ones that I wear the most. And I even wore sneakers for this outfit. Typically I'd go for loafers, but I know some of you don't wear them, so I wanted to give you something different. The bag is a Paravelle Grand Tour. The leather trims are really well made, and the bag is spacious enough for a weekend trip. I've never had a white duffel before, but I really like this one. This is probably the most comfortable one from this video. Okay, let me share a secret with you. Something that I've been working on for a very, very long time that is right inside the Forte series dog kit. I'm only going to show you a peek. Like I'm not supposed to be showing you this right now. That's all I'm going to say. All right, so let me take you to a really cool location for this next outfit. This next outfit is perfect for a sophisticated lounge or restaurant or maybe an event where you have to look more elevated. There are some outfits you wear that make you feel powerful and this makes me feel that way. It definitely oozes that masculine energy. It's not the kind of outfit that a teenager would wear to go out. The moment you put this on you're going to feel like a man. The wool pants are from Suit Supply and they have a perfect straight fit. too tight, not loose either, just absolutely flawless. I like tucking in my polo because I really like this detail of the side adjusters you're showing. Of course, you don't have to do that. You can just wear untucked. It still looks really good. The black buttonless polo has been my signature look for a little while now. This is also from Suitsupply and I'll wear it all the time because it's so versatile. It can be dressed up or down. The fabric is breathable and it's really comfortable. The Todd's loafers are pretty chunky. They have these thicker soles and they're ideal for the harsh weather. So now during the fall and winter, I'm going to be wearing these a lot. The suede jacket is from Reese. It's a beautiful trucker jacket. I think every man should have a suede jacket in his closet. Now I like that the color is so neutral. So you can mix and match it with browns, with grays, with blacks. Mix it easy. As for accessories, the Audemars Piguet code in rose and white gold, it matches the vibe perfectly. And as always, you can find alternatives within your budget. But I might have saved the best for last. This is the kind of outfit that a stylish CEO wears. It's masculine, it's classy, and it's elegant. The whole shirt is from Banana Republic. I really like that it's grayish brown, which means it's easy to style with black, gray, or brown. And that's why I'm wearing these beautiful pants from Suit Supply in a similar tone, but leaning more towards gray. I got these custom made, so I chose the fabric, the fit, the hardware. I'll be wearing these a lot this season. The black loafers are also from Suit Supply. They're killing it lately with their new collections. Every guy needs a pair of black loafers. So if you don't have any, these are a great option. Now the quilted vest is something that a lot of guys are scared of wearing. And this isn't the usual Patagonia finance bro vest. It's thinner for a modern gentleman. Nothing wrong with Patagonia, but if you want a classy quilted down vest, this is what you should aim for. It's from Reese, and it's a great piece for this transitional weather. The sunglasses are from Jack Marie Mage, and they have this beautiful gold detail on the sides. And the watch is the newest addition to my collection. Patek Philippe Aquanaut in rose gold with a chocolate brown dial and strap. I still can't believe I own this and I catch myself looking at it all the time. So what was your favorite outfit? Let me know in the comments and subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " James Bond has his watch. Tommy Shelby his flat cap. John Wick has his tie. And Tony Montana has his gold chain. Us men have been wearing accessories as a means to differentiate ourselves from others since the beginning of time. We wear accessories that match our personality, our trades, our lifestyle. Some of them are helpful tools like watches, glasses, or a duffel bag. Some of them are strictly for style and personality. Regardless of the reason you accessorize, one thing is for sure, accessories are fun. There are so many to pick from, no matter what your personal style is, you're gonna find accessories to match it. From the most casual to formal or edgy, there's a lot of options and it can be overwhelming. Do I want a black leather backpack or brown? Are backpacks even cool anymore? Should I just try one of those man purses instead? Wait, what am I thinking? I can't wear that. Maybe I'll just go with this tan messenger bag. So today I wanted to share the accessories that excite me, that elevate my life. And I wanted to tell you why I think every man should wear these seven accessories based on my personal experience, helping men look better since 2015 here on YouTube. Maybe the most popular men's accessory, ranging anywhere from $2 to millions of dollars, a watch. A watch is possibly the most important accessory for men. Some men wear one to know the time. Others as a tool to help them with their jobs or their hobbies. And somewhere watches to answer phone calls. The three things you should think about before getting a watch are this trap. Do you prefer a stainless steel, a leather, or rubber strap? The size, typically you measure that by the size of the case. I'm not a fan of big watches, so my watches range from 33 to 41 millimeters. But if you're a bigger guy, and you can absolutely go bigger, or if you like smaller watches, you can definitely go smaller. And the budget, because watchers are so popular, you can find them in any range imaginable. So you should know how much you wanna spend before you go shopping for one. Once you know the answer to those questions, then do some online research and start getting a picture of what you can see yourself wearing to then go into the store and try to watch on. It's a fun process and a watch is something that you can wear every day. So it's better to take some time to do the proper research and get the right one instead of buying something that you're not gonna like wearing. Some watches I recommend are the Seiko SWR 052, the Tiso PRX Powermatic, the Hamilton Kaki Field Expedition Automatic, or if you wanna get started on your luxury collection, then you can start looking at Cartier Tanks, Rolex Submariner, or James Bond Varian, Omega C Master, No Time to Die. And look, watches are cool, and they also serve a purpose. They help you track time. And this next accessory does absolutely nothing, but it does look good, which makes you feel good, which gives you confidence when you're out facing the world. I remember always wearing a necklace growing up. I just always liked them, especially in the summer because you can't really wear much else. So a necklace adds some personality to your look. I personally only wear silver or gold necklaces. I don't like the leather, the beads, the pearls. I know there's a ton of options out there, but I keep it simple. I like brands like Pira. I have a few different talismans from them that I really love. Surge The Neem has a lot of great options. Shout out to my buddy Ali who started that brand and they're crushing it right now. Miancai is great. David Yerman, if you wanna go a little bit more luxury. I mean, there are so many endless brands doing men's accessories so you can find anything you want in any style that you desire. Now, I like shorter necklaces because I like them to show if I'm wearing a button shirt. I also don't usually wear just chains. I prefer necklaces with a pendant, with a talisman. No offense to my man, Tony Montana. An accessory we started seeing a lot more recently is the toiletry bag, also known as the Doppkett. You see athletes carrying them, and honestly, there comes a time as a man that bringing your grooming essentials in a plastic bag just isn't gonna cut it anymore. And that's when you upgrade to a masculine, elegant, practical do<|id|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|> one by one. The Santos Doppkit is large enough to fit all of your products but soft so that it can conform to a small space in your bags or in your luggage. The design is masculine, it's elegant, just like everything else we do at Forte. The compartments have organizers inside to keep your items from getting messy and the price is within everyone's budget. I'm dumping my $500 Tom Ford Doppkit for this one. Ours is way better for 10 times less. A Doppkit is really practical because because it's great for guys who shower at the gym, right? Or guys who are jet-setters flying all the time. We called it Santos after the Brazilian aviator, Santos Dumont, and as you know, I'm Brazilian. My dad would always tell me about how Santos Dumont was the first man in the world to fly a plane, even though there's some controversy there that it could have been the Wright brothers, but my dad would never agree with that. It's one of my favorite accessories. I've had so many different top kits, so it's exciting that I got to design one from scratch for you guys. And this launched today, so you can be the first one to get it. It's live now at Forteseries.com. This next item is something that we've all carried at some point, a backpack. And they come in all different shapes, sizes, fabrics, colors, the options are endless. Now I've always liked a good backpack. They're just so practical, right? You can carry all of your things and then you can still be hands-free. So they're perfect for commuting to and from work, for the gym or for travel. But recently, backpacks have been getting some hate. Some people specifically, Gen Z, say that it's an ick. Honestly, my ick is the word ick. Like I hate that word. It used to be the word cringe. Now that was my least favorite word. Now it's definitely ick. And here's the thing, I do agree that some backpacks aren't cool. If you're a grown man and you're wearing this Jansport backpack, yeah, it's not gonna be the best. But there are so many great options nowadays. I personally like leather backpacks or at least the ones that have a leather trim. They look more classy and they can dress up your look. I mean, look at brands like Carl Friedrich, Ralph Lauren, Shinola. They make great masculine leather backpacks. You should start with a black or brown backpack. Those are gonna be the easiest to match with your outfits. But of course, backpacks might not be your thing. In that case, you have another strong masculine option, a duffel bag. Duffels are great because you can get them in all different sizes. I splurged on this one from Louis Vuitton. It was expensive, but I've had it for over five years. I even shot an unboxing video here for YouTube when I got it, and it still looks good. I bring it with me to trips. I also pack it with outfits and all my essentials for my video shoots. So it's been a great investment. Now, if you want something a little bit more affordable, Paraville makes great ones too. It's a little bit harder to keep it clean, but it looks really classy. Other brands that I'd recommend are Coach, Leatherology, and Maverick and Co. Here's my one thing with Duffel. The one thing that I don't like about them is that when you're traveling with Duffels, they can get pretty heavy. Right, a backpack is definitely easier to carry with the two shoulder straps, as opposed to one across your body. But you have to admit, a leather Duffel just looks so premium compared to anything else. It's masculine, it's practical, and it completes your look. And look, I know we're now leaving the summer sun behind, but that doesn't mean that it won't be bright enough outside for you to wear. One of the best accessories ever created. Sunglasses are so popular that sometimes they become a part of your identity. Just look at Tom Cruise and Top Gun, Keanu Reeves and The Matrix. Elton John always in his bold sunglasses, and even some of your favorite creators like Casey Neistat. All the items on today's list, I'm okay buying online without trying them on first. But sunglasses, that's where I draw the line. They need to fit your face really well. That's hard to do when you're online shopping. Some of them are too small, others cover half of your face. Personally, I always suggest classy frames. That's definitely the way to go. Brands like Most God, Oliver Peoples, Persols, they make classy, sturdy and stylish sunglasses. I also got these from Salt Optics that I really like. Lately I've been into smaller frames and gradient lenses. I think they give off a classy look. While keeping it young, keeping it fun, not too stuff. Even though Samuel L. Jackson had a ton of accessories in Pulp Fiction, maybe his most famous and unique accessory was his wallet in Boston with that. It's a really good example of what wallet not to buy, but you have to admit, it's memorable. Besides the ugly text, it's also too big for me. Nowadays we have Apple Pay, and I don't like to carry a lot of cards and random things in my wallet. I keep it clean with a buy fold pocket organizer from Cartier. That's what I'm rocking nowadays. It's slim, it has enough room for all of my cards, my ID and some cash. That's all I need. But when I wear a suit, sometimes I swap over to a slim card holder from Tom Ford, just so it fits into my jacket pocket. But I rarely do that just because my pocket organizer is slim enough. Don't get a lame wallet. I know not too many people are gonna see it, but the last thing you wanna do is go on a date, and then when it's time to pay for the bill, right, you can close the deal, you pull out this Velcro wallet or something with a chain attached to it. I always think, what would James Bond do, right? And this is way more in line with that style than this. Those big bulky wallets don't even fit into your pocket. They look bulky and it's not the kind of bulge that you want. Bottega Veneta has beautiful pocket organizers. I like mine from Cartier, but you can find them within your budget from a bunch of brands out there. What you need to decide before anything else is, what do I absolutely need to carry with me? Get rid of any cards that you don't use, coupons, random, you don't need, and whatever's left, that's what you get a wallet for. And it could be a full-size wallet if you absolutely need those things, or a pocket organizer, or as small as a card holder if you only need a few cards and your ID. Once you know what type of wallet you want, then you can have fun shopping and get something that complements your style. Unlike a wallet, this next item doesn't serve any purpose besides adding a cool detail to your fit. A bracelet, a cuff. Mine, I just got this one from Cartier. But there are two things you should keep in mind when it comes to bracelets. One, don't get anything that's too childish that looks like you just made it before you went out. And then two, don't wear too many. You don't wanna be that guy wearing a lot of bracelets, it just looks a little choogie. This next item is something that I used to wear all the time And then I stopped for the longest time and I just started wearing them again, maybe two months ago, a belt. I've just never really liked belts. They are uncomfortable. They kind of like sink your waist a little bit. So for me, I've never liked them. But nowadays I wear belts as a means to just change up my style. I've been tucking in my shirts a lot and the belt stands out. But of course they also have a purpose. If your pants are too big, you can throw on a belt and voila, problem solved. But honestly, I just think they're really cool looking and I just really like the buckle detail. Personally, I've been going for thinner belts. Leather is the way to go. Brown or black is usually what I go for. Suit supply has really great options right now. I really like these buckles and I really like the width of these belts. I have this one in silver and I also have this crock leather in gold that I just got from their new fall collection. One advice I give you when it comes to belt is don't get the ones with all of those monograms or patterns or different designs going on in the belt. Get something that's simple, clean, classy and elevated. That's it, and you don't need to spend $500 on a belt just because it has a designer logo on it. The ones from Suit Supply are $100, which honestly is the most you should spend on a belt. If you enjoyed today's video, don't forget to hit that subscribe button below and leave a comment letting me know which accessory was your favorite. I know it's gonna be the Santos Dove kit, which is also listed in the description below. Go check it out, it just launched today."

        "transcript": " For an immigrant like me who came to the US as a teenager with my family, with no savings, no knowledge of the English language, and no idea what I was getting into, becoming financially free just doesn't seem possible. So it always surprises people when they find out that I quit a six figure full time job at Google in my 20s to work for myself and achieve financial freedom around that same time. Now, what I wanted wasn't just financial freedom. I was getting paid well at Google, so my finances, at that point, they were fine. Six figures, stock options, the best health insurance and benefits, they even paid for my travel and education so I could have stayed there for a while and I could have just saved up. The reason why I quit, what to most people is a dream job is because I wanted location and time freedom on top of financial freedom. I wanted to be able to work from anywhere. I wanted to travel, live anywhere I want and I wanted to be able to take time off whenever I felt like. If I want to work two days a week, I can make that happen. I'm my own boss. I make my own schedule. I wanted total freedom and that's why I worked really hard towards becoming financially free. So when people tell me Alex, I want to do it too. I want to be financially free like you. I always ask why. Why do you want to be financially free? And it seems like a dumb question, right? Who doesn't want to be financially free? But the truth is most people give me different answers. Just a few days ago, one of my friends was visiting me and he told me that he was sick of working. He wants to be financially free. So naturally, I ask him why. He says he hates his job, doesn't get enough days off, so he feels stuck going into the office every day. And then he said he's not getting paid well. He gets paid just enough to cover his bills and have a little left over for his social life. So he's not saving any money right now. He's 29 years old by the way. So I think he's really feeling that pressure of turning 30, which is totally normal. So I asked him the same question one more time. Why do you want financial freedom? Because you've only told me the reason why you hate your job, not why you actually want to be financially free. So he takes a few seconds to think about it. And then he finally told me that he wants to spend more time with his family who lives in Texas. He lives in California. He wants to have a savings account with enough funds to feel safe because he wants to have his own family soon and he's scared that he won't be able to provide for his family. As a man, by the way, that's really scary. He wants to work on meaningful things instead of wasting time working miserable jobs that don't really fulfill him. And that is a much better answer. Now we know what he's looking for, what his goals are instead of the problem, which is the job that he hates. Now, I like doing this exercise for everything in my life. A lot of times we focus on the problem because that's all we can see. the bank account with low funds, the job that you don't like, the apartment with no air conditioning, or the relationship that you're in that doesn't bring you joy anymore. Those are the problems, right? But I like to focus on the solution. What's the solution? What are your goals? And so if you're someone who wants financial freedom, I ask you why. What are your goals? Everyone has different motivations for financial freedom. And not only that, everyone has different definitions for financial freedom too. So what does it mean to you? Does it mean being able to quit your job or go part time? Do you want to own a house that's fully paid off? Do you want to be able to give money to charity? Do you want to be able to fly business class every time you get on a plane, or do you want to fly private jets? Or maybe you want to be able to hire a chef or a full-time assistant or babysitter to free up your time so that you can spend more time with your friends. You need to know why. You need to visualize what you want out of this. Only then will you be able to create a plan because if you're not sure of the goal, you can't make a solid plan. And that means that you should also know how much you need to achieve that goal, right? Because like I told you, I grew up in Brazil, right? If I was making $5,000 a month in Brazil, I would be very well off. That's about 27,000 reais, which is our Brazilian currency, and that goes really far there. I could own a big house, drive a nice car, eat at great restaurants every week, invest money every month. It's a lot of money. To put it into perspective, the top 1% in Brazil. You only need to make 20,000 reais a month to be in the top 1%. So side note, if you get a remote job that pays you five grand a month in USD, Brazil might be a good option for you. But if you make five grand a month in Los Angeles, Miami, or especially San Francisco or New York City, you're in trouble. The average monthly rental price for a studio apartment in New York is $3,590. There's barely anything left over and we won't even get into income tax deductions and all that, right? So in those places, financial freedom is more like making $20,000, $30,000 a month. And even then, there are levels to this. I have friends in my building paying $30,000 a month for a three bedroom apartment. This is where a lot of people go wrong. They start by thinking their goal is to make $100,000 a year, but really that's just a random number that looks good. It's round, right? But it's a made up goal. And it's funny because today you might think that $100,000 salary is amazing. But usually as soon as you hit that goal, you're gonna want more. And you're gonna say, well, 100 isn't really enough because I upgraded my apartment. I have a girlfriend now and she likes to travel. All of a sudden your expenses go up because you're making more. So you want to make even more now. Now you're making 100K, which was your goal initially, and you're still not financially free. And you think you need to make 150K to get there. But the same thing will happen when you make that extra 50K. I guarantee you, $100,000 a year won't seem like a lot when you get there. So you're gonna want more. I remember when I got a job, I was making 5,000 a month at the time. I thought it was insane. I felt so rich. And honestly, within a few months of making that money, I wanted to make more. What happens is you end up realizing that it's not about the number, the amount, it's about the life you want to live. the feeling you get from being financially free. So instead of giving yourself a numeric goal first, like $100,000 a year, think of the feeling that you want, the life that you want to live. Before you just randomly pick a number for your dream income that will finally make you financially free. Stop and go through what I call L-I-F-E, life. L is for location costs, where you live. You need to consider the cost of living in your specific area or in the area that you want to live in. I is for your individual lifestyle. This is your desired lifestyle, including, you know, your car, preferences like your shopping, you know, restaurant, hobbies, vacation habits. F is for financial career goals. So you have to decide if early retirement is your goal, how many hours a week you wanna work, you know, what kind of work you want to do, if any. And E is for your end goals. So your long-term life goals, personal ambitions, like starting a family, big passion projects that you wanna pursue, or maybe supporting your friends and family financially. Once you have those answers, then you can work backwards and figure out how much you need in order to feel financially free. This is the new number, and it's now in line with your dream life and financial freedom, right? And instead of just a made up number, that just sounds good, like, oh, I need 100K a year, or I need a million in my bank account. So let's start with L, location costs. If you wanna be financially free in a big city, like LA or New York City, your cost of living is gonna be high, right? Your rent, let's say, is $5,000 a month, which by the way, that's just like a one bedroom, like a nicer one bedroom apartment in New York City. You should aim to make at least $200,000 a year to follow the golden rule of rent costing 30% of your income. If you wanna be financially free in a small town and rents, let's say 2,500, then your cost of living goes down, so your salary should be at least $100,000 a year, which follows the 30% of your income for rent rule. Then we move on to your individual lifestyle. So you're spending habits and preferences in New York City, you're not gonna need a car, which is great. So you're saving a little bit there, but you're gonna spend on Uber's, let's say. All right, each ride is gonna be an average of $30. Both ways, that's $60. Let's say only three times a week, which is not a lot. That's $180 per week, $720 per month. If you like going out to eat once a week, good restaurants are not cheap in the city. You're gonna spend around $200 per dinner for two people. So that's $800 a month if you're going out once a week. Just those expenses add up to $78,240. Then we add on supplies, fund spending on shopping. let's say two vacations a year, that sounds nice. Your $200,000 salary doesn't seem like much anymore. And if you have financial career goals to retire early, guess what, you have to save, you have to invest. So there's a lot more that you need to do in order to achieve your goal of being financially free. And last but not least, your end goals, starting a family, passion projects, helping out your family financially. Your salary, honestly, it just evaporates like this. I just wanna be real with you, because being financially free isn't coming up with a round number in your head, like a million in the bank, 100,000 a year. You have to know what kind of life you want. Then you start to work backwards to achieve that goal. So many people make that mistake in the very beginning and it's the reason why they get lost along the way. And if you wanna have enough money to live a luxurious life with no care in the world, no looking at prices is before you buy things. No checking your bank account every day to make sure that you have enough money to pay rent or go to a restaurant or maybe go to a vacation. If that's what you want, and I know a lot of you do, then here's what I recommend you do. Step one is you need a mindset shift. Look, when I moved to the US, it was the first time that I realized that my family didn't have money. My friends at school, they were nice clothes. I wear clothes from yard sales, or in a good day, I would wear clothes from a sale from a discount store, which they would sell slightly defective items, but from good brands, so that was like, I was so happy when I could buy that. My friend's parents, they drove nice cars. car brands that I had never even heard of. We bought a car for $500 so that we could get around. They bought extra food at the cafeteria, every lunch, every breakfast. I couldn't afford that. I got free lunch from the government and I never spent a dollar extra because I didn't wanna burden my parents with more bills. Now, most people in that situation either get jealous and frustrated because others have what they don't or they just feel bad for themselves, right? They become depressed, they become unmotivated, they kind of just cave in. I don't know why, but I was different. Seeing what was possible, seeing those cool cars, the good food, the nice clothes, the smile on their faces, man, the way that my rich friends were just happy, right? With not a care in the world. It fired me up. I didn't know it at the time, but I learned years later that thankfully, even though I was technically poor, I didn't have what's called a poverty mindset. A poverty mindset is when you believe you will never have enough money. That getting ahead is way too difficult or that financial freedom is just a fake dream. People who are stuck in this mindset believe they will never make enough money to go on nice trips, to buy nice things, to have a fat savings account or an investment account. Something that I've noticed too is that people with a poverty mindset, they tend to hate people who make a high income. They call them cheaters. They get upset when they find out how much luxury items cost and they act as if they would never spend that much on a car or a watch or a house as if they will ever get there with that mindset. They won't. change your mindset, you will never believe that you can achieve it. How would you achieve something? If you don't even believe it yourself, so you have to rewire your brain, you have to change your thoughts, your outlook on the world, and it starts with developing an abundance mentality, an abundance mindset, which means believing there are plenty of opportunities out there and that you are capable of seizing them. That's why you need to surround yourself with the right people. It's so important. It's the reason why I started an exclusive community for men who want to reach that next level and by the way it's free to join. Alright we have over 2,000 members and we're opening up another 500 spots this month but we only accept members who are serious or committed to look better, to earn more, to elevate themselves. It's also first come first serve so if you want to join Men's Image Lab for free, hit the link in the description below and let us know why you want to be a part of our community. Look community is important and there are three things that I found that have the most impact on developing the right financial mindset. One is consuming success stories. I started watching videos, TV shows, reading books about people who came from nothing and made it big. And it showed me that it's possible. I wasn't watching fiction things. I was watching nonfiction. I was watching real stories. A couple of months ago, I met and shot a video with Kevin O'Leary. If that immigrant kid from Brazil at age 15 could see into the future, I think he would have a heart attack. Sure, I didn't have a poverty mindset, but I definitely didn't think that anything that I've achieved today was even possible back then, mostly because I didn't even know that you could buy a watch for more than a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars to me was so foreign. Flying business class or private, I didn't even know what that meant. So you have to learn what it means. You have to see that it's ahead of you, that it's palpable, it's reachable. The second thing is you need to surround yourself with ambitious people. I started hanging out with people who had big dreams and were working towards these dreams. Their energy was contagious, right? It made me want to work harder to build the life that I wanted instead of just dreaming about it. That's one of the biggest reasons why I created Men's Image Lab. And number three, you have to practice gratitude. I know it sounds like kumbaya or whatever, but it's so true, man. Every week, I like to write down three things that I'm grateful for. It keeps me grounded, it makes me happy. You know, when you have a busy schedule, you tend to kind of forget, right? You don't really look back, you don't have time to look back and see all the things that you've accomplished, whether they're big or small. So be grateful if you started a new job, if you learned a new skill, if you made advancements into your career, or if you made a new friend. You know, those are all things that should make you proud. that feeling, that pride, feeling grateful. It's no balls into more actions, into more wins. Consistently doing these three things will open your eyes to what's actually truly possible. But changing your mindset, that's just the first step. Once you have that abundance mentality, you need to know what to do with it. And step two is something that I wish I mastered way earlier. In fact, most people start this step way too late in their lives. You need to budget. It's not the sexiest topic, right? but this is the foundation that's gonna set you up for all the other steps. For example, when I started working at Domino's Pizza at 14 years old, I was making like $200 per paycheck, right? And I remember for months, I would just save half of that if I could, $100 each time. And eventually I saved enough to buy my first car. It was a green 1995 VW Jetta. I loved it. I was so proud of that car. And saving up to buy that car taught me a lesson to always think about the future, right? Think about a goal and to not spend all your cash right away on dumb things. My car cost less than $2,000. I saved for a long time. I could have blown all of that money on clothes very easily over that period of a year that it took for me to save that money. So spending less and saving your cash is a necessity if you wanna be financially free. According to a recent survey, actually 27% of American adults have no emergency savings at all. And another 28% have less than $1,000 saved. That means that over 50% of Americans are just one unexpected expense away from financial trouble, from debt. Don't become a part of that statistic. I actually recommend you follow a very simple, easy rule to get started, 50, 30, 20 rule. If you want to budget efficiently, it's really simple. 50% of your income goes to your necessities, housing, food, utilities, things that you need to survive. Number two, then 30% goes to your personal expenses. You know, the fun things like clothes, entertainment, whatever makes you happy. The final 20% goes straight into your savings and any debt repayment. So if you stick to this, you're gonna start seeing a difference in your bank account within a few months, if not a few weeks. So you need to realize that budgeting, it's not just about restricting yourself, right? It sounds so boring. It sounds so frustrating to have to budget, to restrict myself. It's actually about giving yourself the freedom to spend on what matters to you later on, like my car, without guilt. It's about taking control of your money instead of letting it control you. So many people are controlled by their income. You have to control your income. And if you're only making enough to cover your bills, no amount is too small to save. Start wherever you can and then go from there. You wanna focus on building the habit, right? Building that muscle, not just chasing a savings amount. Like you have to actually every month save a little bit, whatever you can. But to become truly wealthy, the truth is like, you know, savings, they can only take you so far. This is because most savings account, they give you such low return. In simple terms, the purchasing power of your money is like actually decreasing over time because of inflation. So it's like having a bucket with a little hole in it, right? You're putting money in there, but it's slowly leaking and you're not even realizing that. So that's why step three is one of the most important steps that you can take and that is educating yourself about investing. Look, I'm no financial advisor by any means, all right? I had to learn it by myself, I figured it out, I have a team now, so I learned from my team and I'm just passing on what I've learned. And the earlier you start, the better. Younger investors, people in their 30s or below, they actually earn about 15% higher returns when compared to older investors. And this is just because they started earlier because they have more time for compound interest to take effect. When I first started, I was terrified of losing money. I was so scared. So I started small. I've always worked really hard. But when I was younger, I had no money to lose. So anything I put into my savings, into my investments, I thought, I cannot lose this. This is all I got. So I started as small as I could, and I would use apps like Robinhood for stocks, Coinbase for crypto, and I just got a feel for it. Just trying to understand how things work, and that's okay. Starting small and investing consistently over time is way better than not starting at all. So let's break down three types of investments that I focused on. The first is of course the stock market. This is usually where people start. You can buy individual company stocks. Just don't spend all your money on a specific stock because your friend told you that it's gonna blow up. Make sure that you study it. Consult with a professional if you can or you might lose your investment. Crypto is the second one and as you know this is even more volatile. It's exciting, it's cool, but it's risky. Anything that's exciting like that tends to be a little riskier. So I started with very small amounts on CoinBased and I learned as I went. Three is real estate, which is obviously a great way to just diversify your investments. One thing I wanna say is that there's always a trade-off between risk and reward. Generally speaking, investments with higher potential returns like crypto, for example, have higher risks. Lower risk investments like bonds or index funds, typically they offer less returns, but with less volatility. I started small, I learned as much as I could along the way and over time I got more comfortable. I started to branch out. Now I have investments in stocks, crypto, I own properties in LA, Miami. I've done a lot of angel investments in startups and I've even invested a ton of cash into starting my own businesses, which I know will pay off in the end. But I just wanna remind you again, this didn't happen overnight. It took time, a lot of research, tons of learning, a lot of mistakes, so that's why it's important to start early so that you can learn and apply it as you get older. Anyone can make money with a lucky invest, But the key is actually to become a smart investor, not just a lucky one. Read books, take courses, follow financial news. It might seem a little overwhelming at first, but trust me, it gets easier and it's totally worth it. I love it, I nerd out on that stuff. I like checking what's going on on Zillow, checking the prices of properties around me. I think it's fun. Also remember that diversification is crucial. Diversify your portfolio. Don't put all your money, all your investments, all your eggs into one basket. spread your investment across different types of assets, balance out the risks, and always think long term. The stock market, it's gonna go up, but it's also gonna go down. Historically, it's always trended upwards over long periods of time. Like I said, I'm not a financial advisor, and what worked for me might not work for everyone, so always do your own research, and obviously consider talking to a professional before you're making any big financial decisions. If you wanna know what resources that have helped me the most, you should definitely check out these books. I think this would be super helpful if you wanna write these down, or I'll probably just list them below in the description to make it easy for you. But I really like The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco. This one completely changed how I think about wealth creation. Really liked this book called $100 million Offers by Alex Hormozzi. If you wanna know how to create amazing offers, this is like the Bible for creating offers. Rich Dad, Poor Dad was probably the first ever financial book that I've read. It's by Robert Kiyosaki. It's a classic and it's gonna shift your whole perspective on money. A lot of people sh** on this book, but honestly, it's a really good way to start. The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday. It's not a financial book, but it's a book that will turn challenges into opportunity. Never split the difference. It's by Chris Voss and he covers negotiation skills that are gonna serve you not just in business, but in life overall. So highly recommend that one too. The Power of Habit by Charles Dujig and Grit by Angela Duckworth. This book really taught me the importance of discipline, the importance of perseverance and achieving long-term goals. But don't stop just the books. You know, dive into podcasts, YouTube channels, online courses, whatever works for you. The key is to make learning a daily habit. Just keep upgrading yourself. It's like you're getting an upgrade every single day, like a software upgrade. So you're better and better and better. And you know what's wild? According to research, the way you look has an impact on your income. So if you wanna make a higher income, you have to present well, you have to look your best. So check out this video right here on how to look your best to boost your income, your confidence, and to finally have the looks that you've always wanted."

        "transcript": " Bad skin is like an annoying website pop-up ad that won't go away no matter what you try. It's distracting and it takes away from what really matters what's underneath the hood. When you go online and search for a good skincare routine, you get these beauty gurus telling you that you need to spend an insane amount of money on a 10-step routine that takes 30 minutes. That's just not realistic. Sure, we want clear, smooth, nice skin, but we also have sh** to do. That's why today I want to give you a skincare routine that anyone can implement to their daily lives because it only takes three minutes and it provides great results. But here's a trade-off. You're just not going to see those results if you're inconsistent. So if you do this quick and easy three-minute skincare routine once a week and then complain that you're not seeing results, well, that's on you. You have to be consistent. So try your best to do it every single day. All right. First things first, when you touch your forehead, your nose, your cheeks, what do you feel? Is it sticky and a little oily or is it dry? And it can be both. For example, I have an oily T zone, which means my forehead and my nose are oily. Maybe you have oily skin throughout or dry skin. The reason why this is so important to know is because it will have an impact on the kind of product that you use. You don't need heavy serums, heavy oils when you already have oily skin because that's only going to make it look extra oily and and it could clog your pores. But if you have dry skin, that changes things, right? And you can then be applying those heavier, creamy moisturizers or thick serums to rehydrate that dry skin. So before you even start your skincare routine, just take a moment to understand your skin type because knowing that is the best place to start. Now that you know your skin type, let's move on to the first step of our three-minute skincare routine. Let me ask you a question. Do you think fish can see water when they're swimming? Their eyes are adapted to being underwater. So no, they don't see the water in the same way that we do. Think of the air and atmosphere around us as water to fish. We don't see it, but we know there are molecules traveling around. We can breathe them in, we can breathe them out. We can smell coffee because it's dispersing tiny particles into the air and it travels through air and into your nose. All of that to say, there are things around us that we cannot see like dirt particles, air pollution, even chemical compounds from the burning of gas, tobacco, et cetera. All right, that's as scientific as we're getting today. I just wanted to make a point. Just because you can't see the skin on your face is dirty doesn't mean that it isn't. All of those tiny particles and bacteria, they can cause clogged pores, breakouts, pimples, making your skin look bad. So how do we fix that? It's simple. You need to cleanse your face with a face wash. Start by getting your face wet with lukewarm water, then apply a gentle cleanser to your face and massage it into your skin in a circular motion for about 30 seconds, focusing on areas that are prone to oiliness or breakouts. That's why it's good to understand your own skin and your skin type. After you wash it for 30 seconds, rinse well with lukewarm water. Now, one big mistake a lot of people make, I'd say the majority of men do this, is for getting to wash their towels. If you're washing your face, then rubbing a dirty towel onto your clean face, guess what, that's making it worse. So pat your face dry with a clean towel, just wash your towel with your laundry every week, or whenever it gets dirty. Okay, so cleanser your face took literally 30 seconds. It's so easy. Make sure to do it at least once a day, ideally though, twice. Once in the morning and once at night before you lay down. And if you've ever had pimples, which by the way, the majority of us have gone through a period of our lives where pimples covered our entire faces, some of you might be going through that moment right now. I know I did when I was a teenager and my hormones were literally all over the place and those pimples, they usually go away. Sometimes they don't, but they can also cause some nasty scarring on your face. Sometimes it's just a little bit of scarring. It's still there, but barely noticeable. But sometimes they can completely change your face. It's frustrating, demotivating, it crushes your confidence, especially for men, because, well, I know it's 2024, but typically men don't wear makeup. So you can really see those scars on your face because we don't really cover it up. I wish people knew this. There are ways to minimize those scars over time. And it's not that difficult. You can even do it at home. The most common and most effective way to minimize acne scarring from the comfort of your own home is to do something called micro needling. Maybe you've heard of this term before, maybe you don't know what it means, let me explain. Micro needling is a process of, and this is gonna sound weird and painful, but trust me, it's not, it's the process of puncturing the skin with tiny needles to stimulate the body's natural healing response, which leads to more collagen production, reduces the appearance of acne scars, fine lines, and it improves the overall skin texture. Now, this isn't something that you do every day. You only do this every two weeks. So it's not a part of your quick three minute everyday routine, but if you're consistent and continue to do this every two weeks, you're gonna see a big difference in scarring and skin texture. I noticed my skin texture looks smoother after only a few weeks. The Banisher 3.0 is backed by dermatologists like Dr. David Lim. It has the finest needles on the market, 0.5 millimeters, which is scientifically proven to be the best for collagen induction. And it comes with two heads. You get four to eight treatments per head and it's better and safer than using derma rollers, which can actually cause scarring. So how do you do it? Well, with clean hands and a clean face, you're gonna fill this cap here with 70% rubbing alcohol to sanitize the bristles for five minutes. And then just let it dry for a minute. This is the Bannisher 3.0, by the way. Bannish is a sponsor of the channel. They wanted to show you how simple it is to minimize those acne scars. You just stamp the Bannisher on the area that you want to treat three times, making sure that you avoid any acne or any rashes because this isn't to treat acne, just the scars. And the best way to describe how it feels, it's like putting a piece of Velcro on your skin. It doesn't hurt at all. I'm not gonna lie, I was a little worried that it was gonna hurt and leave marks on my face, none of which are true. The first time I used it, I thought I was doing it wrong because I couldn't feel the needles piercing my skin and it turns out that's exactly how it goes. You're not supposed to feel needles going in. It's painless. Don't stamp your face hard, just apply light pressure on those problem areas And then after you're done micro needly, you apply the banished serum, which is formulated to increase collagen production, fade those dark marks, and to give you that morning glow that makes your skin look so healthy. And within one to three months, you're gonna see visible results on acne scarring. It's easy, it's way cheaper than getting it done with a dermatologist or going into a clinic for a professional treatment. And you only have to do it once every two weeks, once a week, maximum. It's so easy, it's painless. I'm gonna leave the link to banish in the description below, but it's banish.com slash alexkosta. It's the first link in the description below. Now, if you're not micro needling, then after cleansing, you're gonna notice that your skin, it's just not gonna feel as nice. It'll probably feel dry. That's because the cleanser, it pulls away those natural oils from your skin, so you need to bring back hydration to your skin. And you do that by using a good moisturizer. Moisturizing helps to lock in hydration. It repairs the skin barrier, and it keeps the skin soft and smooth, which is all we want, right? All you have to do is apply a dime size amount of moisturizer to your face and then just gently massage it into your skin. And a pro tip here, especially for my older guys, this goes for my young ones too. If you want to keep looking young, make sure that when you massage the moisturizer into your skin, you're using upwards and outwards motions. Why? What does that do? Right? Why is there a difference? Well, that prevents your skin from sagging, from creating new wrinkles. So don't pull your skin down when you're going through your skincare routine. So why does our skin even sag? Well, because gravity is pulling down your skin every single day. So you're adding even more wrinkles by pulling it down further. And not only that, another tip is for my guys with a beard or a stubble, make sure that you get the moisturizer in there to moisturize not only the hair, but also the skin underneath it. Something I completely overlooked when I was younger is my neck. You can tell someone's age by looking at their neck because typically people forget to moisturize it. So don't forget to also apply a generous amount of moisturizer, apply it to your neck twice a day, whenever you can, to avoid those deep wrinkles that age you. And avoid those thick, greasy creams if you have oily or acne-prone skin. Do it twice a day after you cleanse in the mornings and then after you cleanse at night before you go to bed. This should take you no more than 30 to 45 seconds to apply this moisturizer. By the way, on this channel, it is my job to make you live a better, healthier, more incredible life by looking and feeling your absolute best.

And I was one of the guys that completely missed the mark on this step. And honestly, I paid the price. All right, now I'm going to show you in a second what happened to me. Look, the biggest enemy, the most powerful villain in the battle for great skin is also So the only reason you're alive right now is the sun. Those UV rays, they cause premature aging, they cause hyperpigmentation and even skin cancer. We've known that for years, but still, some men choose to not protect their skin with a simple SPF sunscreen. Applying SPF 30 or more to your face daily. The SPF is going to help block or absorb some of those UV rays and then keep them from harming and damaging your skin. This is especially important if you're outdoors during the day. If you're driving under the beating sun, but even when you're not, I still recommend that you apply sunscreen daily. It's all about creating this habit, right? How do I create a habit? I have to do it every day. So create this habit so that your skin is protected just in case you do decide to go outside. Make sure that you do have that sunscreen protection on. And just the same as the moisturizer, you're probably forgetting to apply sunscreen to your neck. So remember, apply it to all exposed areas of the face and neck to keep those areas looking young. I'll tell you why I regret not doing this so much. I have spots on my face that literally showed up after exposing my face to the sun for a couple of days without sunscreen. And I did this honestly for years, but two years ago, specifically I went to an event and I put this like serum, vitamin C serum on my face, which was like an oil serum. And the sun literally cooked my face with that oil, right? Those UV rays, they burned my face, causing sun damage here, here and here. It gave me sunspots that are permanent, by the way. And after that, I decided, you know what, enough is enough. I don't want any more sun damage on my face. I talk about this on YouTube, but why did I mess up like that, right? So I started wearing sunscreen every single day, 30 or more. I don't budge when it comes to this rule. And I've been applying all sorts of expensive creams and serums to slowly fade these spots away and they've gotten better, but they're still not fully gone. So I really regret not protecting my skin in the first place. Prevention is the way to go. It's your face. Trust me when I say you don't want any sun damage on your face because it's really hard to fix. So make sure to prevent it. Apply SPF 30 or more every single day and your face will thank you for it. Your skin is going to look younger and healthier with no sun damage and most importantly no skin cancer. Now my favorite part of a good skincare routine is this next one. And I like it so much because I can literally see and feel the results immediately and you only have to do it twice a week. Instead of cleansing your face with normal face wash, I want you to twice a week use a scrub or an exfoliant to brush away the dead skin cells and reveal the brand new smooth skin underneath. You can keep the scrub in your shower. That's when I like to use mine. It's like a nice little spa situation. And use circular motions to lightly exfoliate your skin. Your skin will immediately feel soft. It's gonna look clean because of those brand new skin cells right there. And it's cool because you get those results immediately. you see them right away. And if you want to go above and beyond, I have a video on how to achieve perfect skin right here. If you're feeling like doing extra credit, if your skin needs more care, definitely watch it. But of course, these simple steps that I just went over, they're all you need for a great beginner skincare routine that only takes three minutes and will deliver results as long as you stay consistent."

        "transcript": " The average lifespan of a human being is 27,375 days. That's 75 years, by the way. A lot of us won't even make it that far. It's kind of a morbid way to start this video, but I wanted you to have that number in mind as you watch this. And we're going to come back to it in the end. But my goal is that by the end of this video, you're going to feel a fire, a drive that will get you excited to maximize every single one of those days. Because let's be honest, most people don't make the most of their time. It's rare that you see someone crushing it, squeezing every minute out of the day to live out their best life to be successful. When you see those entrepreneurs running a bunch of businesses, managing their social media accounts, then they still have time for vacations, a wife and kids, and somehow they're hitting the gym every single day to stay in shape. Do you ever wonder, how do they manage to do all of that in one day? It feels like they have more hours in the day than you do, right? Well, they don't, right? They have the same 24 hours in a day and around the same 27,000 and days total to live. And that's why if they can do it, if I can do it, then you can do it too. And if you don't know me, hi, my name is Alex. I left a high paying job at Google to pursue a path where I could truly be my own boss. Fast forward to today, I've built multiple businesses from the ground up, being fortunate enough to make millions along the way. But if you know me, you know, I'm not just about making money, it's nice, but I'm about designing a lifestyle that allows for growth, that allows for freedom and happiness. So I'm here to share how you can do the same. optimize your life and stop wasting time on things that won't make your dreams come true, that won't make you any happier. And look, you clicked on this video, which means in one way or another, you know you can optimize your time better. Maybe you get to the end of your day and you feel frustrated because you haven't accomplished everything that you set out to do, you're stuck in this cycle of busyness without real progress because there is a difference, right? Between being busy and making progress. And I've been there too. There were days that I would sit down in my desk in the morning and before I knew it, It was 6 p.m. I had moved an inch closer to my goals. It felt like I was just running on a treadmill, busy, yes, but stationary and it was really frustrating. And this is especially true if you're an entrepreneur and you work for yourself. Because when you work at nine to five, your boss fills up your time for you. He's telling you what to do. He gives you your assignments, your projects, and he decides how you're spending those 40 hours a week. When you work for yourself, and even to some degree when you work from home, you have to manage your own time, right? It's the one thing that doesn't stop. Whether you're ready or not, whether you're sick, healthy, tired, energized, the clock is ticking. So here's how you can take control of your time and stop wasting your life away. First, the biggest time suck in most people's lives nowadays is designed to be exactly that. A time sucking attention grabbing platform. And that is social media. These companies like Meta, Google, X, TikTok, they're all after one thing and one thing only, your time. So much so that the biggest data point that they look at is watch time. Watch time is how long someone spends watching content on their platforms. And the more watch time, the more advertiser revenue these platforms make. Back in the day when we used Instagram, we had a chronological feed, right? We followed 50 people and every day you'd be able to see what your friends were up to. In most days, you'd actually get to the end of it and IG would literally let you know, hey, you're all caught up, you did it. Well, nowadays there is no end to your feed. As a matter of fact, I don't think people realize this, but why do you think Instagram got rid of the chronological feed? Or at least they hit it really well so that people wouldn't even use it. That's right, watch time. They don't want you to get to the end of your feed because that means you would exit the app and go live your life outside of their app. And as of August of 2024, TikTok users upload 16,000 videos every single minute. That's 981,000 videos per hour, 34 million videos per day or 707 million videos per month. When will you ever be caught up again? So Instagram, of course, got rid of the chronological feed, introduced this new feed based on the success of TikTok's Never Ending For You page, and all of a sudden, their watch time skyrocketed. When I see people asking for the chronological feed back from Instagram, I just laugh, because it's never gonna happen. It's not good for their business. Look, my point is social media is made to hijack your attention and ultimately to take up as much of your time as possible because your time is their revenue. So how do you take control of your time on social media? Well, the first thing you need to do is be aware of your social media habits, your behavior. So most people go in for a quick two minute check to see what's going on in the world and then suddenly they're an hour deep into topics they don't even care about in the first place. If you're one of those people, there are a few ways to stop that. And the easiest thing that you can do is to move your social media apps from your home screen. Just hide them into a folder in the second or third screen of your phone or remove them completely so you have to search for them. Because a lot of times you go into a social media app on impulse. You open your phone, you don't think about it, you click on that social media app, 30 minutes go by like this. Adding this extra step will give you a second to think and decide whether or not you want to scroll on TikTok or Instagram. And that one second that you have to think about it might just stop you from going there after all. Now look, the next step is actually installing an app like Opal, I'm not sponsored by them or anything, I just have a few friends that use this app and they love it, you can customize it to blog specific apps to keep distractions away and to focus. And you can even choose specific hours that you wanna be able to use your phone. That's for my guys, my people are watching this right now who have a hard time not going into social media. You install an app that blocks apps. The next thing that you can do is limit your screen time, right, this is free, you can do it right from your phone. You just limit the usage of the apps that suck up most of your time and you're gonna get a notification when you reach that limit. I think 30 to 60 minutes should be more than enough for your daily social media usage unless it's part of your job. And it's funny because most people scroll at night in bed, which is arguably the worst time to do it. We know that dopamine hits right before going to sleep. That's not a good idea. And we know that blue light from those screens right before we sleep also isn't good. It makes no sense. Not only that, but we know that there are tons of other negative outcomes from spending too much time on social media. FOMO, depression, mental health issues, addiction, privacy issues, and so many others. And look, I know the majority of my viewers are men. We tend to push these emotions down, not deal with them.

I've been struggling to keep up with work lately. I feel like I'm not maximizing my time. You do so much in a day. How do you do it? Can you show me? The first thing I thought was, wow, I love this question because most people would just complain that it's too much, that they can't do it. And then they would just crash and burn, right? But by asking me, it shows that he wanted to step up to the plate and to grow, to become more skillful, to elevate himself. And that one question gave me the idea to shoot this video because if he's struggling, then I know there are so many others out there who are having the same issues. So I sat down with him. I gave him a few pointers on how he can optimize his project management. We use Asana at Forte series. Asana is great for overall project management. Keep doing that. But how do you manage the hours within your day? And he actually didn't have an answer. Here's the thing. If you have a lot on your plate and you're not extremely organized, what ends up happening? Things slip through the cracks. I have multiple assistants who can add calls, meetings, events to my calendar. I live and breathe by my calendar. I like to say that if it's not on my calendar, it's not real. It's not going to happen. So I opened up my laptop and I show him my calendar and how I manage every single task, every hour, everything is properly organized and my day is just laid out perfectly in front of me. Because the alternative is having a lose to do list, right? And it's just not enough if you're trying to optimize your day. If your list says you need to finish a deck for work, go to the gym, reply to a few emails, it's fine, but when are you doing those things? You're not going to be able to hold yourself accountable until the very end of the day when you look at your list at the end of the day to see if you've done everything. But if you have your gym set for 7am, the work deck at 8.30am, reply to emails at 11am, then you're actually freeing up time in your afternoon to do other things, other projects. You can hold yourself accountable every hour as opposed to every day. If it's 8am and you haven't been to the gym yet and you said you were going to go at 7, you know that you're late. You know that you have to make up for it somehow. So you can hold yourself accountable. I highly suggest that you use a calendar and keep track of your hours and avoid just making a loose to-do list because it's just not as specific or organized and you end up paying the price. And by And by the way, that price compounds over time, right? Because if you don't get your work project done today, you have to push it to tomorrow, which means you have to skip the gym, so on and so forth. That's how you get behind in life. It just snowballs until you're 30, and then you finally realize, damn, I've been wasting my time. I'm in my 30s now, and I haven't really accomplished the things that I set out to do. There is one thing that completely changed my life and that I believe is the reason why I'm here today. I believe it's the reason for the success that I've had. I didn't go to school for fashion or videography to build this YouTube channel to four million subscribers. I didn't get a degree in business so that I could build my brand forte series to a multi-million dollar business. Those things happened because of one thing only, discipline. In all fairness, look, discipline was something that I learned as a young kid. Still living in Brazil, going to a military school, I had to wake up way earlier than my friends who weren't going to this military school. I had to shine my shoes, I had to make sure that my uniform was ironed, and I had, I'm not even kidding, I had this little book that I had to keep on me at all times and this book was signed by my captain every time I got a haircut. I'd have to go up to him, take off my hat, show him my haircut and then he would sign it and date it. Every 14 days that would have to happen and if I didn't have my haircut within 14 days and if he saw that, I would get in trouble. I was 12 years old. I grew up quick. One thing I realized going to military school was that I loved having a routine. I loved getting my uniform ready the night before. I loved getting my haircuts every two weeks, right on schedule. I liked marching information precisely to the beat of the band. I appreciated structure. I appreciated a routine at a very young age. And I kept that as I got older, even after my family moved to the US as immigrants, with very little in the bank, but lots of dreams. Having a routine is highly beneficial for improving your efficiency and your output. It helps keep you organized. It helps you stay on track. It reduces decision fatigue because you already have your day laid out in front of you. So instead of wasting time and energy deciding on what you're gonna do, you already know. You just gotta focus on those things. It increases your productivity. It increases your focus. It optimizes your time management. And it's even healthier because if you go to sleep and you wake up around the same time consistently, it stabilizes your body's internal clock. So your mood is improved, your memory improves. I mean, I could go on and on, but establishing a healthy discipline routine is so underrated. Our great example is you can be a naturally gifted athlete and it'll work for a while, right? But the less talented athlete who is disciplined, who is driven, who wakes up early to practice every single day, eats the right nutrients, gets the right amount of sleep, he's going to win. That's just facts. And it's something we talk about inside my free community, Men's Image Lab. We have over 2,000 members networking, learning from each other, and I do live calls there all for free. I haven't accepted a lot of new members because I only want the right guys in there and it's free after all. But I'm opening up more spots today for you guys watching this video. So if you wanna join us, I'm gonna leave a link below. Just make sure to add a profile photo at least and then let us know why you want to be accepted because otherwise you're gonna be rejected. So if social media is number one in terms of time sucking, then the number two time sucking machine in today's society right after social media is of course your TV. Every day you turn on your TV, there's a new blockbuster movie, a new season of an amazing show with a great cast, right? There's a new streaming platform, literally all the time, Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix, Peacock, Max, Hulu, the list goes on and on. Similar to social media, it's impossible to watch everything because there's just so much content. And look, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you to throw your TV away. I get that it's deeply threaded into our culture. And sometimes you almost feel dumb when people ask you if you've watched, You know, I don't know, Game of Thrones or Harry Potter and you say no, because you haven't. I get that. But it becomes a problem when you spend one or two hours watching TV every single day. It might seem harmless at first, but you add it up and you're spending 14 hours a week watching TV. That's a part-time job. You know, it's time that you can be investing into yourself, into your dreams, your goals. You can be learning a new skill, networking, or even just relaxing in a way that recharges you and gives you energy to go tackle your goals rather than just numbing your mind. And I'm not saying that every show is numbing, I get it. I like watching shows because I am a visual person. I appreciate set design, I appreciate angles for shots. It's really cool, but at the same time, you are kind of wasting time. So here's my advice, set designated nights for TV. Maybe it's your Friday night chill time or Sunday movie night with your partner. Make it social, make it count, but don't let it spill into your daily routine. That way you can still enjoy the series that you like. Right, you're not watching TV, you're still doing that. But it's not taking over your life. So it's funny, when I lived in LA, I was there for 10 years, I didn't have a TV in my bedroom the entire time. So people would come over and they'd be like, you don't have a TV in your bedroom? And they would look at me like I got two heads, you know, like I'm crazy or a weirdo. And I decided to do that because that was hustle time for me. That was crunch time. I was building this channel. I didn't want the distraction and it really worked. because for me to go to the living room by myself to watch TV, it would just never happen. So I highly recommend you get rid of your TV in your bedroom if you are in this hustle time, in this building time. And you can still have one in your living room, you can make it social, you can have fun on that designated time that you set out to watch TV. But when you put it in your bedroom, sometimes you're about to lay in bed and you're like, you know what? I'm gonna watch one more episode of something. And then you go to bed an hour later, which means you wake up an hour later and there goes that time. Now there's one thing that I recently did that really changed my whole day and it gave me a lot of extra hours, a lot of extra time that I didn't know I had. I was able to buy back that time with the hard work that I put in first. And let me explain what that means. Optimizing your daily chores is where you can truly reclaim a lot of lost time. I mean, think of all the small recurring tasks that eat away at your day, right? And these little things that they don't take up a lot of time individually, But together, when you're shipping out packages, cooking, grocery shopping, taking out the trash, doing laundry, this goes on. And look, of course I have the means to get help now, but there are ways that you can do the same without having to spend as much. And that's how it starts. I have multiple assistants who help streamline my tasks. They handle things like scheduling, errands, inbox management, calendar management, laundry, et cetera, et cetera. I use meal delivery services for ready-to-eat, healthy meals. It sounds crazy, but it's not that expensive. It's a lot more practical and it doesn't take up any of my time to just heat up a healthy meal. And then I don't have to think about it. I don't have to count my calories. Everything's already written there, all of my macros. And it sounds a little crazy, but by delegating those tasks to someone else, then you're saving a lot of time. And if you're making $50 an hour and you're paying someone $20 an hour to do a task like this, you're saving money, right? Because you're applying that extra hour to work and you're making 50, spending 20, You still net 30 and now you don't have to do your laundry. Now, if your budget allows, I would highly recommend you outsource, you automate, you delegate, even something as simple as investing in a Roomba robot vacuum. Like you can save you time each week for grocery shopping, set up delivery services, set up recurring charges or curbside pickups, use technology and services to handle those repetitive tasks so that you can focus on what's truly important to you, whatever that is. And maybe it's social time, maybe it's actual work time. But at the end of the day, remember, it's not about having time. It's about making time. Every minute that you save from these activities is another minute that you can spend growing, learning, enjoying life to its fullest. Don't forget, the average lifespan might be 27,375 days, but it's up to you to make each one of those days count. Start today because time waits for no one.

        "transcript": " In the next 10 minutes, I'm going to break down all the main types of hair products, what they are, how to use them, and the common mistakes to avoid. As the founder of the hair products brand Forte series, I know a thing or two about hair products. I've spent the last seven years researching, testing, and of course making my own products. So I know it works. I know it doesn't work. First up, let's talk about hair creams. Creams feel more like a lotion. They're soft and as the name suggests, they're creamy, right? They're usually really great at adding moisture, adding hydration to your hair. And typically they're going to have light to medium whole. And the reason why creams are so moisturizing is because they usually have ingredients like shea butter, argan oil, jojoba oil, which are great especially if you have dry frizzy hair. Now I like creams especially right now with the trendy hairstyles being a little bit longer, a little bit more flowy because creams are lightweight. So you can create soft natural styles like a middle part, a messy quiff. It's also really great for curly or wavy hair. So if you want a curly undercut or any wavy hairstyle, this is perfect because it doesn't lock your hair into place fully. It lets your hair have that natural movement which is very trendy right now. And in terms of finish, some creams definitely have a shiny finish to them but the majority will give you a natural finish. Not matte, not shiny, just healthy looking. It's probably the easiest hair product to apply to because it has this really soft pillowy feel to it. It's easy to scoop, it's easy to emulsify which means just you know kind of spreading it around your hands and it's easy to apply. It's not going to tug and pull your hair because it's so soft and creamy. Can you use a cream as a pre-styler? I get this question a lot, and yes, you can. Now, if you don't know what a pre-styler is, you're in for a treat because it's actually such a great hack for an amazing hairstyle. Pre-styling your hair is when you apply a product to your hair when it's clean and damp before your style your hair. And then you style your hair with a blow dryer or whatever your preference is to lock in the hair, and then you use a styler which really holds it all together. So pre-styler is just a product applied to your hair before you style your hair. And the cream, because it's soft, because it's so creamy, it's perfect for that, right? You can just apply it to your hair and you can blow dry it, it's not gonna tug and pull your hair. I use pre-stylers all the time, it's a big hack and most guys aren't even aware that this exists. They don't even know that this is a thing. So I highly recommend that you try it next time you style your hair. By the way, I'm gonna list all of the products that I'm using and demonstrating this with in the description below. You can go to Forteseries.com as well, we have everything there. Now, let's move on to clays. You know, you can definitely see immediately there's a big difference from a clay to a cream. This is a lot thicker, it's tougher. Clays are known for three things. They have strong hold, matte finish, and a gritty texture, which also gives your hair some beautiful texture like you see it here. Now what's cool about clays is that they have this dry, gritty feel compared to a cream or a pomade, so it's really great for short, textured hairstyles. But it gives you a really strong hold that lasts all day, so it's my favorite product because I like to lock in my hairstyle, right? I don't like it when my hair moves too much during the day. I style it and then I want it to stay pretty much the same like this throughout the day. However, a good clay, like our textured clay extreme hold, doesn't feel like concrete. It doesn't feel like super glue. It holds your hair in place, but you can still run your fingers through it. For example, I literally just put this on about five minutes ago and I can run my fingers through my hair and it almost like holds it up when I bring it up, right? And you can change your hairstyle up if you want. So let's say a girl wants to play with your hair, her fingers aren't gonna get stuck in your hair. It's gonna feel soft, it's gonna be flexible. But once you leave it, it stays like this. It's honestly pretty incredible and that's why it's my personal favorite. That's why this is the product that I've used the most. Having said that, I will say this clay is hard to use. If you don't know what you're doing, you're gonna do it wrong. You have to scoop hard and once you have the product, you need to warm it up into your palms. It melts with your body heat, so make sure that you spread it around your hands evenly and most of it, use those biceps, get it going, okay? Most guys who don't like this product, any bad reviews that we get on the Texture Clay, it's usually, oh, it's too hard. I don't know how to use it. It's usually because they just don't know how to apply it. So a pro tip for you, if you wanna make it a little bit easier for you, you can just blow, you can just literally blow dry it into the jar. Warm it up and it makes it easier to scoop. Because once it dries up, it gives you this type of hold. Not every clay is this hard to scoop, by the way. We have also, this is the Extreme Hold Clay, right? Our Control Clay is a much softer version. It's easier to scoop, a little creamier than this one. If you don't need a 24 hour hold, if you don't need crazy hold like this, then go for the control clay. Okay, so this next one is completely different from the others, and it's this guy right here. It's a styling powder. This product is a complete game changer for adding volume, adding texture, without weighing your hair down, because it's powder, so it's incredibly lightweight. It absorbs some of the oil in your hair. It adds grit to it, which is great if you're thinning, or if you just have fine hair, because by sucking up all of the oils in your hair, think about it, it gives your hairstyle more fullness, right? Because the oil weighs your hair down and if you have fine hair already, then it makes your hair look extra flat. So this is gonna suck up those oils, it's gonna give you more volume, more body, and it also adds lift to your roots, which is perfect for guys who want a natural matte finish with lots of volume, especially like I said, if you're thinning or you have fine hair. To use it super easy, just shake a small amount onto your roots, not your ends onto your roots, and then you work it through your hair with your fingers. Not gonna lie though, this is some powerful. So the key is to start with a small amount and then add more as needed because a little goes a long way and if you put too much into your hair, I'm telling you it's gonna feel a little dry, it's gonna feel a little chalky and too gritty, so you wanna start small. This is powerful. This is perfect for creating those messy, textured hairstyles that are so popular right now, that like the TikTok E-Boy hairstyles or any messy fringes, it works really well whether you have curly, wavy, or stick straight hair. So it's a very versatile product. And what I like about it is that you can just keep it in your gym bag or whatever and just use it without even getting your hands dirty. So it's very practical. Now, let's go on to the most classic hair product. Let's see if you know this one. This has been a go-to styling product for decades with roots dating back to the 18th century. Palmades, they're mostly known for their high shine, they have really strong hold. And even though they've been around for a long, long time, they actually only became super popular in the mid 1900s when those iconic hairstyles that you've seen in the movies all the time, pompadours, slickbacks, those hairstyles started to trend and then pomades started to really, really trend and became very popular. Now there are two types of pomades that you should know the difference for. One is an oil based and the other one is water based. Oil based pomades are usually made with ingredients like petroleum, beeswax, and they have the highest shine. So if you want to slick back hairstyle, That's going to give you that very high shine. They also stay soft, so it's easy to restyle throughout the day. Water-based pomades, they have this gel-like consistency. They have a really strong hold, and one of the benefits is that they wash out very easily with just water. I use the Forte pomade anytime I want a hairstyle that has more shine to it. So any slick back hairstyle, pompadours, or even sometimes when I'm wearing a suit to a wedding or an event, right? I just feel like the shine adds some type of old money aesthetic look and vibe to it. So if you're going for more of a traditional quiff, for example, the pomade is the way to go. And I'll give you a pro tip, and I've done this for years. When you're using the Forte pomade, you can actually choose how shiny you want your hair to be. And you do that by adding water to your palms when you're putting the pomade into your hair. So you just emulsify the product into your hands and then just wet your palms a little bit or a lot, depending on how much shine you want. And it works really well if you want that shiny, slicked back hairstyle, for example. Okay, I'm excited to talk to you about this next one. This product is extremely popular right now. It's one of our best sellers. This is the sea salt spray. And the reason why this product is so popular right now is because of the TikTok hairstyles. They're very popular, right? The messy, carefree looks, the wavy, curly hairstyles. Also it's one of the easiest products to use. I mean, you can't get this wrong. And I'm going to show you how to use it in just a second. This product, it's really amazing for creating those effortless, beachy waves, for adding natural texture to your hair. It gives your hair this tussled look. perfect for casual laid back styles. It adds volume without that heaviness, right? It's just a spray. It's liquid in here. And also it's great for every hair type, but it works especially well for guys with fine flat hair that just need a little extra oomph, right? That extra volume, some waves, some texture. This is gonna give you that and it's so easy to use. All you got to do is you start with damp hair or towel dried hair and then you just hit the spray a few times from your roots to your tips. You scrunch your hair with your fingers and you enhance those natural waves by adding texture. And then honestly, you can just let your hair air dry for a chill, relaxed look. Or if you want to use a blow dryer, you can do that in a ideally use a diffuser to control the volume, to control that definition that you want to give your hair. All right, let's move on to pastes. Usually pastes are going to have a consistency that's usually a little harder than a cream, but still smooth. It's kind of soft. It kind of like a lotion. It's not as hard as a clay. That's for sure.

        "transcript": " I just bought my first Patek Philippe. I remember the very first time I heard of the brand Patek Philippe and it was actually on YouTube. I'm a huge John Mayer fan and I was watching John Mayer talking watches on Haudenosaunee. The very first video they launched together, it was about 10 years ago. And I didn't actually buy my first luxury watch until many years later in 2018 when I bought my first Rolex Submariner when I hit a million subscribers on YouTube. So that video talking watches with John Mayer was really a gateway into luxury watches for me. And after buying that Rolex Submariner, I started building a little collection. Now I still wear it pretty much every watch all the time. I wore the Rolex yesterday actually when I went out for lunch and I still love that watch. But this watch is very, very special to me. This is my first ever Patek. This is something that I've always looked up to that I honestly, when I watched that video with John Mayer never even thought that I'd be able to afford anything like this during my life. And I've always loved watches ever since I was a kid but after that first Rolex purchase I started building an actual luxury collection of watches. And you've seen some of those watches here on YouTube. I posted about them. I post myself wearing them all the time on Instagram or TikTok. But this is the big boy. This is definitely my biggest purchase when it comes to watches and I'm so so excited to bring this home with me. And immediately when I got this watch I was like this box this box is massive it's just beautiful it's so much bigger and heavier than anything that I have here at home and just the level of quality that you get from this Patek box it's just insane it's so heavy it's so beautiful I'll show you what the actual box looks like here and you're gonna see what I'm talking about I mean it's just fantastic Look at that. It's like a treasure chest. Like you open this and you expect there to be gold bars and just light up your face, you know, with just treasure inside of this. And honestly, that's kind of what's gonna happen, right? Because as soon as we open this, we get to see what's actually inside. And it's basically treasure. I mean, look at that. This is the Patek Philippe Aquanaut 5167R. This is a watch that I've had my eyes on for a very long time. You have to pinch me. I can't even believe that this is now a part of my collection. The sizing for me is perfect. It's 40 millimeters. I absolutely love the brown. I never thought I'd be getting a brown Patek Philippe Aquanaut. It didn't cross my mind up until I saw this watch. And I just thought, I absolutely love the chocolate brown. I love chocolate. I like earth tones. This is the perfect watch for me. And it's a classy and sporty watch. How is that even possible? How can something be classy and sporty at the same time? Well, it's classy because it's not a big watch. It's not clunky, right? It's not this massive watch. It actually sits very nice and flat on my wrist. And it's of course sporty because of that playful brown rubber bracelet. They don't call it rubber, but it's rubber. I love this watch. I'm so happy with this purchase. The only thing about this watch is I'm not gonna wear it all the time just because I don't think it's one of those watches that you wear all the time, but I want to. And it's just a dream. It's a dream to be able to have this in my collection. All right, let me take off the tank here so you guys can see what it looks like on my wrist. I mean, look at that, absolutely stunning. I love the clasp here, the double butterfly clasp just opens up so cleanly, absolutely stunning. I'll let you into a little secret. Sometimes when I'm working, I would literally just place it down on my mouse pad while I'm working so I can be on my computer and I'll just look down and just see that movement. I mean, it's just so inspiring to me. It's so exciting to me. Absolutely beautiful, classy. I'm in love with this watch. And when you put it on, it's actually a little bit big on me. I have to resize it just one more time. I was scared of cutting it too tight because you actually have to cut the bracelet for it to fit you perfectly. So we cut it and it looks okay, right? but it slides a little bit too much. I don't like all that movement on my watches. I like them to be a little bit more snug right after my wrist bone here so that it stays pretty secure. I don't like to feel it sliding up and down my wrist. But the bracelet is so comfortable. This might be one of my most comfortable watches. It's this one or I would say maybe the Omega No Time to Die is up there too because it's such a light watch and I love that bracelet. Very different watches, very different watches, but this one is incredibly, incredibly comfortable. And I love just that logo there on the clasp. I wore it to the Hamptons for my birthday last week. So you're gonna see some scratches there, which I knew that was gonna happen, right? It's just a normal thing when you actually wear your watches and I wear my watches. So if you see some scratches, I didn't just open this watch, I bought it brand new and I opened it about two weeks ago and I've been wearing in a sense. The chocolate brown dial to me is an insanely beautiful dial. It's very simple, but also I love the color. Like I said, I never thought I'd get a brown dial type of watch, but this just fits in so well. Over the past few years, I found myself going from black and gray colors in my wardrobe to earth tones, more browns and tans and greens even. And this is kind of a representation of that to me, of that advancement. As you guys know, I'm colorblind. So for me, it's pretty difficult to style colors, especially anything that's really bright. Not to say that this is bright, but I always kind of felt insecure or kind of put into this one box when I'm styling myself because I wanted to make sure that obviously that I look good and that everything matches. So even making that jump from like monochromatic looks to something a little bit more colorful or earth tones has been a pretty big jump for me. And this is a perfect, perfect embodiment of that. I love the rose gold. It's something that, again, I never really thought that I would like. I've always been kind of against rose gold and just like yellow gold, but this rose gold is classy. It looks amazing. With the white rose gold and brown, it just makes a beautiful, beautiful combination for this watch. Let's talk about price. I know you guys wanna know. This watch retails for $46,000. However, good luck trying to get this watch at retail. It's basically impossible, right? The waiting list for this thing is insane. You're gonna have to spend a lot of money on Patek watches for you to be able to even be offered a watch like this. And if you're trying to get it in the aftermarket, you're looking at about $80,000. So it's definitely a man's watch in the way that it looks. And in the pricing, it's not a boy's watch. This is something that really to me represents me, you know, in my late 30s now, I'm 36, man. Kind of crazy to say, right? I'm getting close to my 40s. I feel old, I feel so old. But you know what? It looks good. It looks good, it matches my age. and it matches where I am in my life right now. I feel like a man now. My dad had me at 33, so I'm three years behind on having kids. That's next for me for sure, that's what I want. But before the kids, I felt like this was a good place to start. This is my child. This is my baby for now. And actually at some point, I would love to pass this down to one of my children. So that would be a really special moment for me. One of the things that I wanna talk about with this watch is the wrist presence, because it's not a super flashy watch. Obviously, if you know, you know. You can see this coming a mile away if you're a watch guy. Last week I wore this to a dinner party and I was talking to this high up executive guy here in New York City and I could see his eyes just gazing up and down and just looking at the watch as I was talking and I wasn't trying to show it off. I just had it, normally I was just talking to him and I could see he was looking at it. And it's one of those things that it definitely commands attention. It definitely has that wrist presence And it's something that I talked about with Kevin O'Larry when we shot the watch shopping video that just came out a couple of weeks ago. So if you've missed that video, you definitely should watch it because we talk about some really incredible watches throughout that video. So if you're a watch guy, if you're watching this, definitely watch that video. Kevin O'Larry said, it's all about risk presence. It's all about, you know, you extend your hand, you're looking at someone and you see their watch. And if you're a watch guy, you understand, you know, you connect on a deeper level. And that's how Kevin and I connected. We were both at a wedding in Egypt. He was wearing both of his watches as he usually does. And I went up to him and started talking to him about watches and we created a friendship because of that. And because of watches now, we created this video that we shot together and posted here for you guys on YouTube. Something really cool that came with the watch that I got when I purchased the watch was this case. And this is a case for one watch for the Patek. It's a beautiful case. I love the leather and when you open it, it just has that same high quality that you would expect on a Patek watch. You get it on this case. I wish you could smell this. Smells luxurious. It smells amazing. I have some cases for watches, but typically I have cases for two or three watches. So this is a case that I can just bring this one bad boy whenever I travel with it and keep it safe. So thank you Patek for hooking me up with this absolutely beautiful case that I'll be using when I travel.

        "transcript": " Over 10 years ago, around 2011, men in skinny jeans started to pop up everywhere. It got to a point around 2016 that if you didn't wear skinny jeans, you were off-trend. You weren't stylish. Fast forward to today, and whether you prefer a casual style or like to dress up in suits, baggy pants, or all the hype. When you look back at photos of guys wearing skinny jeans, you can see how horrible some of these outfits really were. Somewhere so tight, I don't even know how these guys were able to walk around or sit down without these pants ripping in half. And I know this because I was one of them. I remember I had a pair of spray-on skinny jeans from Topman back in the day that every time I see an old photo wearing that I cringe so hard. It's absolutely horrible and I can't believe that I paid for that and then I wore it daily. Look I wore it because I thought that's what I needed to wear to look cool, to be on trend and to be accepted as part of like the cool club. And today I see the same exact thing happening with baggy pants. Guys are wearing extra baggy pants just because it's a big trend, even if it doesn't look good. And if we know anything about fashion trends is that they come in cycles, right? Skinnies were cool for years, then all of a sudden they weren't. And the same is going to happen with baggy jeans. As a matter of fact, I'd say it's already starting to happen. But still, I understand why men want to hop on this trend and wear baggy pants. It's a big trend. All your friends are probably wearing them and you don't want to be left out. So the purpose of this video isn't really to steer you away from wearing baggy pants, even though I don't personally like them, but to help you at least do it properly so that you don't look at your photos a few years from now and cringe the same way that I do when I look at mine wearing skinny jeans. So if you're going to wear a baggy pants, at least watch this video so you're doing it right and I'll keep it simple and to the point. I'm going to go over five major mistakes that absolutely ruin that look. Then I'm going to reveal the easy fixes to go from sloppy to stylish so that you can feel confident in your outfits. And first up, the number one mistake throwing off your entire silhouette, chances are, you're breaking the number one rule of styling baggy pants, the rule of thirds. This formula is what makes oversized pants look intentional instead of just wearing pants that look like they don't fit you, that look like you just borrowed your big brother's pants. And the basic idea here is to visually divide your body into thirds. with your top taking up one third and your bottom two thirds. Keeping this ratio automatically makes a clean balance silhouette that looks intentional and styled instead of careless. Just look at the difference when you follow the rule of thirds. I have black pants and white tee to make the contrast pop so you can see the difference really, really well. When your bottoms take up two thirds, your legs look longer, your proportions look a lot better. I mean, I even look taller just by properly adjusting my pants and tee. It's a pretty big difference, right? When your clothes chop you up in strange places, the whole look fills off. And there are people who measure their bodies to know exactly what their ratio should be. But honestly, I think that's overkill. You just need to look in the mirror and you're gonna immediately see if the outfit follows the rule of thirds or not. Look, some men have longer legs and a shorter torso. I have shorter legs and a slightly longer torso. So I have to be really mindful of baggy jeans because if I don't follow the rule of thirds, I look stupid. My legs look really short. So here's what I do to fix that. Sometimes I tuck in my top that makes my legs look longer. It makes me look leaner, it makes me look taller. And in the summer, you could even tuck in just a tank top and have an open shirt over it. It still makes your legs look longer. You could also wear high-waisted pants or just pull up your pants slightly because that's an easy trick to elongate your legs. And you could wear slightly cropped tops. You see a lot of these popping up from brands like Abercrombie because their customers like to wear baggy pants, right? fabric or be customers typically like that. So this is a smart move by them to make shorter tops, therefore making the rule of thirds easier to follow. I'm not saying crop top like showing your belly button. I'm saying slightly cropped just to make your legs look longer than your top. Look, the real goal here is training your eye for balance and fine tuning the proportions until they just feel right to you. But even if you follow the rule of thirds, you can still fuck up an outfit if you make mistake number two. And if you fix this mistake, your outfits will immediately look 10 times better. It's gonna make your shopping a lot easier next time you're getting new pants. The mistake is not knowing the name or the difference between pan fits. And so many guys just don't know. Baggy can mean a lot of different things, right? It's subjective. For when you're shopping, there are actual specific names that will help you choose the right pants and understand what works best for your body type and for your personal style. You have skinny fit pants, which are tight from waist to the ankle, they hug your body closely. Like I said, I'd stay away from those. Slim fit pants are a slightly more relaxed alternative to skinny fits. They're made to follow the natural line of your legs without being too tight. Honestly, it's a pretty solid choice for both casual and formal styles. Tapered fit pants are wider at the thigh and then gradually narrowed down towards the ankle. It combines the comfort of a relaxed upper half with a more tailored lower half. Tapered pants work really well in both casual and semi-formal settings. It really depends on how you style them, but I really like tapered pants. It gives you plenty of room around your thighs, so you're comfortable, but then you look sharp because it comes in a little bit tighter around your ankles. Now straight fit pants have a consistent width from the thigh all the way down to the hem. It's a classic style that's not too tight, not too loose. It's really a timeless fit that can be styled with almost anything. This is another fit that I personally like. It's never going out of style and it looks good with pretty much any body shape, any size. And as the name suggests, relaxed fit pants give you more room, especially around the thighs and the seat, AKA you're behind. This fit is definitely more casual. And in my opinion, it's as baggy as you should go, unless you're a fashion forward guy who likes to step, you know, far outside of the norm, anything baggier than this relaxed fit. It's just a lot harder to style and to pull off. Not saying it's impossible, but it's definitely a lot harder. You have to know what you're doing. Loose fit pants are even baggier, even more spacious than the relaxed fit. So they're comfortable kind of, right? They got that laid back vibe and they're ideal for street wear, for casual outfits, definitely not for anything formal, even semi-formal. Now, pairing them with, you know, really similar oversized tops, that could create a pretty decent look if you're into that fashion forward look. Then of course you have boot cut pants, right? Which flare out towards the hem and then wide leg, which are really loose and baggy. I'm not a fan of either of these. Personally, I prefer classy, timeless styles. So next time you go to a store, just try on different fits. Try the relax, try the tapered, try the slim. Take a photo in the fitting room of each of those so that you know what specific style looks best on you. You never know what's gonna look good until you actually try things on. Something that I'm really proud of is the Men's Image Lab community. If you're a member, you can just post a photo of your outfit. In this case, if you're taking photos of your fitting room of you in taper pants versus relax pants, post it on men's image lab, we'll give you feedback and we'll tell you if it looks good or if it doesn't.

And for that reason, we don't just let anyone become a member. You have to answer a few questions. You have to have a good profile photo. That is the bare minimum. That's all we're asking for. It's the bare minimum. We only want guys who will actually be good in the community, otherwise it loses the whole purpose, right? We only let in a small limited amount of members every single day. We have thousands of requests right now, so don't snooze, don't wait. If you wanna join the free community, the link to Men's Image Lab is in the description of this video right below here. And look, when you try it on, relax or bag your pants, you might see that maybe something looks off. It doesn't look quite right. Well, that's because when you're wearing baggy pants, you have to make changes to your entire outfit. You can't just wear the same t-shirt that you would with slim pants, right? It's gonna make your top look very skinny and your legs look very bulky. Your upper body will look disproportionately small compared to your lower half. It looks completely mismatched. Fashion is all about creating a cohesive and balanced appearance. Impairing baggy jeans with a skinny top just throws it all off. Baggy pants have a lot of volume, right? They have a lot of movement. And when you contrast that with a tight, restraining top, What you get is a disproportionate and awkward style that doesn't really flow. The snugness of a tight top, it clashes with the relaxed, loose fit of baggy pants and it creates this really unflattering silhouette that kind of detracts from the overall style that you're aiming to achieve. Instead, what you should do is wear tops that compliment that relaxed vibe of the baggy pants. So relaxed T's, you know, loose fitting shirts, boxier sweaters, those are all really good choices because they maintain that overall laid back, chill style, right, that chill aesthetic and provide a good flow from top to bottom. Basically, you wanna ensure that the volume is distributed more evenly across your outfit and that results in a more balanced and stylish look. But that's not all because even with a relaxed tee, relaxed pants, you could actually easily mess this outfit up with the next mistake. Baggy pants are meant to give you this relaxed, effortless look, but if you wear them with shoes that are too small, too slim, too narrow, It kind of disrupts that flow. It makes your outfit look mismatched. So if you're gonna wear baggy pants, balance the volume of your shoes so that they won't be swallowed by the pants. Don't get me wrong, some guys can pull it off, but we're not going for the edgy fashion forward here. We wanna create a look that you're gonna feel comfortable wearing. In slim shoes that get lost under those wide legs or a baggy pants, they're making your feet look this proportionally small. If you're gonna wear baggy pants, Always think about the overall silhouette. It can't be mismatched. You need to maintain that same relaxed, wider silhouette throughout the entire outfit. It's all about proportion, harmony. So when your shoes and pants work together, you can create a seamless, stylish outfit. And when they don't, you end up looking like you have a weird body shape. It just looks mismatched. And by the way, you don't have to wear these huge shoes, sneakers, these massive boots. It can be a lot more subtle than that. For example, instead of wearing, you know, the common projects, which are known for being slim, pretty narrow and low, you could just swap them for these sneakers from Arne, which are pretty similar, but very different at the same time. They have a heftier sole, they're wider, and fit the baggier silhouette a lot better. But even with the right shoes, the right top, the right pants, there's one more thing that you always have to consider, and this one is huge. I see guys messing up all the time. Guys will wear their baggy pants and sneakers and the baggy tops to a nice dinner, to a place where you can clearly see it. It's high end, it's elevated, it's classy. Because listen, maybe you can pull off baggy pants and that whole stuff, right? Maybe you can pull it off when you're out with your friends. Maybe you can pull it off when you're running errands, but not for every occasion. And this is a mistake that so many men make. You need to understand when and where it's appropriate to wear that kind of outfit. And honestly, that's why I'm not a huge fan of baggy suits. A suit is only needed when you're dressing up for a nice occasion, otherwise you're not gonna be wearing a suit. And baggy pants aren't classy, right? They're trendy. So a baggy suit doesn't really do it for me. It just looks sloppy, looks like you're trying too hard, unless you're really fashion forward and that's just your look. For the majority of guys, it's just not gonna work. So mistake number five is styling baggy pants inappropriately for the wrong occasions. You have to be mindful of your environment, where you're going or who's going to be there, what people were going to be wearing. Because if you don't, you're going to end up looking like you're underdressed. And that I can guarantee you is one of the worst feelings in the world, right? You walk in, you feel underdressed, you feel awkward out of place, uncomfortable. All of a sudden, you know, your fancy fashion forward baggy outfit, just looks sloppy and not stylish at all. So next time you're styling baggy pants, Hopefully you're going to nail the look. And if you want some help, some feedback, the link to Men's Image Lab is right below. I'll see you there."

        "transcript": " In today's society, true masculinity is under attack. Acti-masculine is frowned upon. We're seeing this happen everywhere. But here's the truth, your masculine energy isn't just important, it's essential for your success in fulfillment. So in the next few minutes, I'm gonna show you seven powerful techniques to instantly boost your masculine aura. And these aren't just theories, okay? They're practical steps. These will transform how you care yourself, how others see you, and most importantly, how you see yourself as a man. Whether you're struggling with confidence, feeling lost without purpose, or you just want to reclaim your masculine energy. This video is the blueprint to becoming the strong, attractive leader that you're meant to be. But before I reveal the first trait, I want you to think about something for a second. Have you ever noticed how some guys, they just command respect when they speak? They seem to have this natural presence without even trying. They don't even need to be the loudest person in the room, the flashiest, or have the best physique. They just have something that's more powerful. They've mastered direct communication. Now, I don't mean to be rude or bossy, but rather communicate clearly, confidently, and get straight to the point. And it works wonders. A 2018 study actually found that employees who don't shy away from direct communication and speak up often are consistently rated as more competent by their teammates and managers. So to improve your speaking, start by removing wishy-washy words like just maybe, I think, for example, let's say you want to ask someone out on a date, instead of saying, hey, I was just wondering if maybe you'd like to grab coffee sometime. You should say, let's grab coffee this weekend. I know a great spot downtown. Or instead of sending an email that says, Hi, I'm just checking in to see if you've had time to send a proposal. I think it would be really important to submit that today. Instead, you should write, Hi, checking in on that proposal. It's important that we submit that today. See how much more confident that sounds. Next time you're in a conversation, catch yourself when you're about to use those filler words. Try your best to cut them out and be direct. But look, mastering direct communication is only the first step. Another key skill goes hand in hand with this and it's something that many guys overlook because true masculinity isn't about suppressing your emotions. It's actually about managing them effectively. I mean, think about it. Who seems more masculine? A guy who's going to lose it. He's going to lose his cool at the smallest thing. He's going to freak out or someone who stays cool under pressure. This is why if you want to improve your masculinity, you actually need emotional control. In the book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, psychologist Dr. Travis Bradbury discovered that 90% of top performers have high emotional intelligence while only 20% of the bottom performers do. So to develop this skill, I have a simple technique that will help you reset and regain control of your emotions. And it's called the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 grounding technique. And here's how it works. One, as soon as you get triggered, immediately shift your focus to five things that you can see. Number two, four things that you can touch. Number three, three distinct sounds. Number four, two different smells. Five, you finally focus on one taste. If you're not eating or drinking anything, just notice the taste in your mouth. It sounds kind of funny, it sounds a little cringy, but the reality is the next time you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed, give this a try and snap out of it. You're gonna regain that emotional control. And this is especially great for you If you tend to get nervous, frustrated, angry, right? And then you start seeing red. I know that in my early 20s, for example, that used to happen to me. And once I started seeing red, I wasn't myself. I couldn't control my emotions. I would either shut down, not talk to anyone and just go hide for a little while, while it would go away. Or I would blow up, which is even worse. So this technique will help you manage that. It will help you manage your emotions. Now that you've mastered your emotions, let's discuss an area that many guys struggle and that is dating. As a matter of fact, your approach to dating is probably destroying your masculine frame, your masculine energy. Think about your last few dates if you've had some, hopefully you have. Were you trying to impress the person across from you? Or were you actually genuinely seeing if they were the right person, the right match for you? Because there's a big difference and it all comes down to your mindset. The best mindset is the complete opposite of what you've been told. Realistically, look, you're not going to find the dream person right away on your first date, right? the perfect match for you. You need to date with an intent to disqualify. All right. So instead of trying to win someone over, you should actually see whether or not they are the right fit for you. So here's what I want you to do before your next date. Write down three non-negotiable qualities that you're looking for in a partner. Maybe it's ambition, maybe it's kindness, or maybe it could be something physical. Like they need to be fit, athletic, something like that, or they need to have a great sense of humor. Whatever makes the most sense for you, whatever matters the most to you, then use these as a filter during your interaction, during your dates. And by the way, you don't have to switch this extremely high impossible standards, okay? But the aim is to balance yourself out and reach a point where you don't just go with your first option because they're available. You're operating with an abundance mindset because you know your worth, which brings me to my next point. This only works if you're constantly improving yourself. You can't be picky if you're not becoming a better man. Being picky has to be earned. For example, if you value fitness, make sure that you're hitting the gym regularly. You can't expect this person to be super fit and then for you to be a slob and not go to the gym. If you want someone smart and curious, you should be reading and learning yourself. Your standards should only reflect who you are and who you're becoming. Also, when you're communicating your standards, don't be a jerk. Alright, being classy and being elegant always win. Yeah, you can be direct. Yes, you should absolutely be looking at this from a lens of is this person worth my time? Is this the right person for me? But don't be a s***. Alex Ramosy posted this on his Instagram the other day and it says, You can really solve a lot of male problems by getting in shape and making money. You still have problems, they're just smaller and you have more resources to handle them. And we'll get into the specifics in just a bit but what I'll say is that I couldn't agree more. If you've been following my journey for a while, you know that I come from nothing. I'm an immigrant from Brazil, my mom was a cafeteria lady at my school, my dad was a dishwasher and we had real problems in our household. Now that I'm fit, now that I'm well off financially, I still have problems, don't get me wrong. But they're not even close to those that we had back then. I invest my time and money into making more, into growing my business, those are my problems. They're very different. I'm not worrying if the car that we're driving to work is gonna fall apart on the way to work because we bought it for $500, right? This is a true story, by the way. That's how much our family car that we drove for years cost $500. It was a piece of sh**. Nowadays, I don't have to spend hours cleaning, doing laundry, I hire help, so they do it, and that opens up my time to put it into my business. I actually use a service called HomeAglot. It's a five-star house cleaning service that you could afford, and it's not even expensive. As a matter of fact, because you're a part of the YouTube family here, you get your first three hours of cleaning for only $19. They sponsor today's video, and they have easy online booking. You can just read the reviews for the available house cleaners. You choose one, book your cleaning, boom, that's it. It's that easy. And every cleaner on HomoGlo has to maintain a 4.8 star average platform rating or they lose access to work for the platform. So they're really all capable and I'm really picky. Picky maybe isn't the word, I'm really particular. I have my systems. I know how I like my things and every time they come and clean my place, I feel great after. My place looks amazing, it smells great, I don't have to lift a finger, it's completely off my plate. and they even have something called the Forever Clean membership, which saves you $30 an hour on all future cleanings, so you can book unlimited cleanings starting at $19 an hour. But I have an even better deal for you today. If you visit homo glow dot com slash Alex Costa or scan this QR code right here, you get your first three hours of cleaning for only $19. So go to homo glow dot com slash Alex Costa and make sure that you use this opportunity to get your space looking clean. Because having a clean and organized space is another attractive quality, by the way. If you're bringing a date home, you don't want to have a messy, dirty space. That's a turn off. But doing well financially fixes that. You can just hire cleaners and that's it. Your place will look perfect. So I do agree with Hermosi. Those two things, being fit, making money, they solve a lot of problems, especially dating problems, and having an abundance of options. And look, I get it, physical attraction is important, but a truly masculine man understands that a woman is just, she's more than her looks, right? Also focus on her personality, focus on compatibility. Trust me, a shared sense of humor, you know, aligned values, that takes you much further than just a pretty face, you're an amazing body, right? By approaching dating that way, you're not just more attractive, you're embodying true masculine energy. You know your worth, you know what you want, you have standards, and you're not afraid to stick to them just because you might not end up with this person who's available and you're just going for the first person who said yes to you, right? don't go for the first person that says yes to you. That's not good enough. But this mindset shift is just one piece of the puzzle. There's another key trait to building your masculine aura and this one, it might actually surprise you. In today's world, a lot of times we're told that men need to be more in touch with their feminine side. And look, there's nothing wrong with that, but there's also incredible value in male only spaces, in male only activities, right? When was the last time that you hung out with just the guys, doing something challenging, doing something competitive? If it's been a while, you're probably missing out on a huge opportunity for growth because one of the most powerful ways to boost your masculine energy is by surrounding yourself with other strong successful men. And Jack Donovan in his book, The Way of Men, found that men have a primal need for physical play, for competition, and for being a part of a tribe. And what that does is it gives men a higher life satisfaction. And the reason why is actually pretty simple. When you're around other men, especially those who are working to better themselves, it pushes you to level up too. It's like iron sharpening iron. So here's what I want you to do. This week, reach out to your male buddies, to your male friends, and organize a guy's night out. But instead of sitting around watching sports, or going to a bar, or going to a club, what you do is you choose something that challenges you physically or mentally. It could be a tough workout, right? So a group workout together, you guys go to the gym, or go do some type of physical activity. It could be a strategy game night, right? It could even be literally a book club focused on personal development. You could even apply to my free online community, Men's Image Lab. We have over 2,000 men who are there to level up their self-image, and it's a space where we deep dive into becoming better men. More stylish, stronger, healthier, sharper, and of course financially free, because male communities are so powerful, right? They provide accountability. It's hard to slack when you're surrounded by guys that are pushing themselves to improve. So I'm gonna leave a link to Men's Image Lab below. Just make sure that you answer the first three questions So we ask you properly or my team isn't going to let you in because we want real guys in there who actually want to grow, who actually want to evolve, not slackers. So we only let guys in that answer those questions in detail. That's the least that you could do. Also there's something about male camaraderie that boosts your confidence in a way that nothing else can. It's actually like tapping into our primal energy that's been with us for thousands of years. Those bonds you make will become a support system and will help you navigate any challenges, celebrate any victories. That's the key part of true masculine energy. But even if you build your male tribe to get the respect that you want, right, you still need to work on your next trait, something that Hermosi mentioned in that post. And that is physical fitness, being in shape. It's not just about looking good in a tight T shirt. All right. It's about capability. It's about health. It's about energy. And it's about tapping into our primal energy. Think about it. Our ancestors, they didn't hit the gym to get six pack apps to look aesthetic, right? They needed to be strong and capable to survive, to hunt, to provide for their love. ones and guess what? Your body is hardwired for that same purpose. This is why working out is so important. If you're a newbie, you have so many great resources nowadays. It's actually insane. You have YouTube videos teaching you how to use the machines in the gym. So if you don't know how to use them, literally just Google it, just YouTube it, right? Or videos that you can follow along for at-home workouts. You don't even have to leave your house nowadays. You have fitness and diet plans available everywhere. There's absolutely zero excuse to not be fit nowadays. I also highly recommend taking up a physical hobby like martial arts, for example, right? Because learning to fight will boost your confidence to like nothing else. And it's going to boost your masculine presence too. And you're going to learn how to handle yourself in any situation, by the way. Martial arts isn't about being a and just fighting everyone because you can. It's about knowing that you can fight, knowing that you could beat those guys up and deciding not to because honestly it wouldn't even be fair. You're a trained fighter. You're above all of that. It's about respecting the craft of fighting. But having good physique, it's great, but it's not the only masculine trait that you need. Let me ask you this. How confident do you feel when you're broke and in debt? You could have a six-pack, but if you're broken in debt, it's not a, it's not, it's just not a good feeling, right? You cannot be confident that way. The truth is that financial stability is a core pillar of masculine energy. Now, you don't have to be rich, you don't have to be filthy, wealthy, but in order to control your life, you need to have control of your money. In Robert Kiyosaki, famous author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, highly recommend the book. I feel like everyone should read that book. He found that men who actively manage their own finances are significantly more likely to achieve long-term goals, long-term success. And what's great is that you can use just a simple but powerful budgeting technique. It's called the 50-30-20 rule. I highly recommend you learn it. It's great for beginners. And here's how it works. I'll give you a quick breakdown. 50% of your income goes to your needs. food bills, right? 30% goes to your once, entertainment, dining out, having fun with your buddies, with your partner, etc. And then 20% goes to your savings or if you're in debt, then it goes into debt repayment. So obviously debt first and then savings. And with this split in mind, 50, 30, 20, just spend 30 minutes, download a budgeting app, go through your expenses from the last 30 days. And this is so simple. It's going to increase your financial awareness by 60% and you're You're gonna be amazed at what you discover. A lot of times people go in debt, people don't really understand anything about finances because they don't even try. They don't even know how much money they're making, they don't know how much they have in the bank, they don't know how much money they owe to their credit cards and knowledge, its power, especially when it comes to finances. Another important aspect of financial stability is having an emergency fund, right? You should have three to six months of living expenses paid so that you can have the same peace of mind and a buffer if things go wrong, right? So those three to six months, they should be in your account As soon as you're done paying off your debt, make sure that you have three to six months of savings. And remember, the goal is to control your finances. Not to let your finances control you. So you're gonna be more confident, you're gonna be more capable, you're gonna be happier. And honestly, you're gonna be more attractive when you're in control of your money. But there's more, right? Imagine waking up every day with a fire. The best way to describe it is it's like a fire in your gut. A clear direction, right? Unshakable confidence. That's what having a purpose does for you. I cannot, this is maybe the most important part this video. So if you made it this far, congratulations. This is the final piece of building that masculine aura. Most guys walk around without a clue about their purpose. They don't know what they're doing. They're drifting, they're reacting to life instead of driving it. And if this sounds like you, I don't want you to worry, right? Because finding purpose takes time. I understand that a lot of exploration, multiple changes in your interests, moving cities, figuring out what you want to do. I get it. To get that started. Here's what you should do. First step out of your comfort zone regularly, often you have to try new things or you're never gonna know what your purpose is. If you're only doing the one thing, how are you gonna know if maybe your purpose is that way? Then you should pay attention to what makes you lose track of time. Because if you're in that flow state, it's a sign of passion. It's something that you really enjoy, right? So maybe you're doing something on your computer and you're like, oh, it's been three hours. Maybe look into what that thing is, maybe that is your purpose, maybe that is your passion. Third, notice what people always come to you for help with. Those are your strengths, right? Then you should identify what annoys you about the world. What's wrong with the world, right? what's frustrating to you. And that's important because that might fuel your change. And your fifth step is to then reflect on your experiences. Keep a journal, write it down, whatever it is. You know, think about what you've learned each week. And honestly, because you're doing that, because you're actually looking for it, you're gonna be able to find your purpose. With this exercise, you're not just looking for a grand life mission, but honestly, you're just uncovering what gives you, what gives your life meaning and direction. Finding purpose is one of the most essential traits because a man with purpose is unstoppable. Purpose, it's like a superpower. It honestly supercharges your confidence. It makes you more magnetic to others and it ties together all seven traits. And if you're ready for a big change, then definitely watch this video on how to go from unattractive to handsome, just by changing a few of your daily habits."

        "transcript": " If I told you to start a conversation with everyone you met for the next 24 hours, how would you feel? Nervous? Intimidated? Well, you're not alone because one in five people now suffer from anxiety and are struggling with these feelings every single day. You see, in this modern age of technology, social media and dating apps, actually starting conversations with strangers is a lost skill. That's long gone. So just like most people, you're most likely just making these big five mistakes that are ruining your interactions and if you ignore them, these could actually cost you potential friendships, your dream job opportunities, dates and so much more. So in this video, I'm going to break down a simple five step framework that you can use to avoid each mistake and to have amazing talks with anyone. And I'm going to keep it simple. I want you to think differently about conversations instead of a regular chat. All right. Think of every interaction as a chance to build an authentic connection between you and the other person. Think of it like building a bridge that connects you to the other side, right? And that's why step one of the five step framework is to check out the landscape. Just like you wouldn't start building a bridge without first checking out the landscape, you shouldn't just jump into a conversation without some mental prep or at least situational awareness. So here's what you're going to do. First, just for a second, visualize a successful conversation. Having a good time, right? Take a second to be like, okay, this is going to go well. I'm going to make this person laugh. We're going to have a good time because when you hold that positive mental image. It's going to calm your nerves a little bit and look everyone gets nervous talking to new people especially if you're not used to it that's normal. So don't think that you're a loser, don't think that you're stupid that's just how today's society is acting because it's not normal to talk to people in person anymore and everyone you meet is a potential great connection. You guys might be strangers now but this person could literally become a potential best friend, a business partner or even of course a romantic connection right so when you see them act like you're gonna become good friends. Don't go overboard and pretend like you already know them, you know everything about them. That's a little creepy. But remind yourself that nothing bad is gonna happen. You're just having a conversation, you're just exchanging ideas. A technique that's known to work is using great posture to your advantage. It's proven that standing or sitting up straight gives you confidence. So when you're talking to someone, remember not to slouch. Keep your shoulders back, keep your chest out. There's no need to be unnatural and robotic, right? It's more of a subtle reminder that you're a strong person and that you're confident. But remember the confidence isn't about feeling 100% ready because at the end of the day, no one is ever 100% ready. You don't know what you're getting yourself into when you're talking to a new person. It's about taking that first step, even when you're nervous. Okay, now that you're mentally prepped, let's move on to actually starting the conversation. Step two is where you start laying the foundation of your conversation bridge. And it's actually where most people mess up big time. And you know, they use generic boring openers and it kills the vibe from the start. I mean, how many times have you heard someone come up to you, oh, nice weather, right? It's boring, man. No one cares. Everyone has looked outside. Everyone knows what the weather is like. Instead, here's what you should do. Open with an observation that's relevant to the situation. Okay? Let's say you're at a coffee shop and the barista is making a really crazy, you know, fancy drink. Make a comment about the drink. Make a comment about the barista. You make a comment about the music that's playing in the background. And the reason why is that it shows that you're present. It shows that you're observant and it instantly makes the conversation more interesting. Also you're both looking at the barista. You're both listening to the same music. So that is something that you have in common even though you just met this person and you have no idea what they're all about or what their values are. And if the music comment, for example, starts that conversation, it's perfect, right? Because then you can pivot into asking them what kind of music they like. And by the way, there's an easy way of saying that without being so generic. Like for example, what kind of genre is your favorite? That's kind of corny. But if you say, you look like you'd be into Morgan Wallin. Did I get that right? It doesn't matter if you got it right or wrong. You immediately start building a deeper connection with that person. Even if they say no, I don't even know who Morgan Wallin is, then you can just ask, all right, well, who's your go-to then? And that's a much better transition into that topic. Remember, the key is to keep it natural, keep it casual. You're not interrogating them, right? You're just starting a friendly chat, just like laying down a smooth solid foundation for that conversation bridge. Also, if you're transitioning from online to in-person interactions, this is very relevant nowadays, right? Maybe you met someone on Instagram or a dating app, right? Try referencing something from their social media account that you've seen or from their dating profile because it shows interest. It gives you an instant connection point. Just don't go overboard. You know, you want to make sure that you look thoughtful, not like a stalker. So a couple of things that will absolutely help you talk to strangers is one, building confidence in your communication skills and two, knowing your core values and sticking to them. And the best way to do that, the best way to work on those things together at the same time is by talking to a professional therapist, sharing your thoughts, getting in the habit of having open and honest conversations. And our sponsor, BetterHelp is the easiest way to get connected to a therapist who can help you achieve those two things simultaneously.

Men don't typically do that, and it's really, really important that you do. Your therapist will guide you through your emotions, through your feelings, but honestly and most importantly, this is something that most men don't even think about. But your therapist will guide you to find and to build your core values. Who are you as a human being? What do you stand for? What are you all about?

So click that first link in my description. It's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta and you even get a discount on your first month. But now that you've started this conversation, most people struggle to keep it going enough to make a real connection, right? How do you get deeper? How do you make a real connection out of small talk and this opener? And this is where things get really interesting because step three is all about building the support beams of your conversation bridge. Like before I dive into that, by the way, let's first talk about the biggest mistake that people make at this stage. And that is turning this interaction into a self-centered monologue. It's like when you turn the conversation into everything about me, me, me, me. So instead it's actually important that you keep the real technique in mind during your interactions. And here's how it works. First R stands for relate. So as you chat, find common ground. It's the same as connecting the beams on both sides of your conversation bridge. For example, if they mentioned that you're there into fitness, they really like being healthy and fit. And you just started a new workout routine or a new workout class. Share your experience, right? You can say something like, oh, I just started that hit class that everyone's been talking about here in New York city. It's kicking my ass. But in a good way. Have you tried it? It's an easy way to relate to that person and their values. Next, E is for engage. So, as you should already know, but you need to show genuine interest during the chat unless you don't have interest. And at that point, you should E is for exit. So make sure that you ask follow up questions to strengthen the connection that you guys have. A is for active listening. Pay attention to details. Don't just ask a question and then kind of zone out while the person's talking to you and you're just looking at the ceiling, looking around, looking at people going by, right? Try to remember the key points that they mentioned because you might want to circle back to that later and that's what creates that true bond, that true connection. It shows them that you care, shows them that you're listening and shows them that you understand what they're talking about. L is for let them shine, give them space to express their feelings, their passions. If they light up talking about something, encourage them to share more. This rise in energy level, it shows that this is something that this person really cares about. And it sets the stage for something really important that happens at the end of every interaction, which I'm going to explain at the end of this video because it's a really, really interesting technique. But here's the thing, even if you've mastered the real technique, R-E-A-L, there are still two more critical steps that can make or break your entire conversation. In fact, most people completely overlook these and it actually costs them potential relationships, life opportunities because communication is everything. So if you want to know the secret to leaving a lasting impression and making sure that your conversation isn't forgotten as soon as it's over, you know, that they forget about you, you're going to want to pay close attention to the next two steps. So now that we've approached and we built a strong foundation between us, right? There's the support beams, we're building this bridge, this analogy is getting old. Look, it's time to get things to the next level. In fact, step four is where many people slip up and they cause the conversation to kind of fizzle out. If you ever had that, you're talking, it's going well, and then it kind of just like starts to die out and you're like, should I leave now? What's going on? We started off well, but I don't know how it's going now. It's like the crucial phase where you either expand a deeper connection or you get stuck in this small talk loop and it's not exciting at all. It's the same conversation that we've had a hundred times about the weather, about some sports game or whatever. It's so boring. You know it's interesting. So a psychologist named Nicholas Epley actually found that people enjoy deeper conversations way more than small talk. But most of us don't get there. We don't realize this. So we stick to shallow topics thinking, you know, this is my safe area. I'm gonna stick to my safe area. It's like ordering a plain vanilla ice cream or a vanilla latte when there's so much more out there. Try something new, a new flavor to get excited by. So to avoid this mistake and to keep things flowing, here's some deeper topics to have in mind just to get things going. Obviously you can talk about travel experiences if you've been somewhere or if you're going somewhere in the future that usually gets you to connect and you can get to understand a little bit more about that person. You can talk about your unique hobbies or unique skills or of course that person's hobbies or skills, your recent books, movies or shows that you've liked that just came out in the movie theater, personal goals or any recent achievements without being braggie, without acting like a dick. Interesting facts about your city or your job, anything that's recent that's going on in your life. But look, the key thing here is you're not interviewing them for for a podcast or for a job. So show genuine curiosity about their experiences and what they're saying. Ask for their opinions. Seek their advice. You're trying to connect with this person on a deeper level. You're not just vomiting a bunch of things that you heard on YouTube from this random guy on Alex Costa's channel. Also, make sure that the topics that you discuss, that they're positive, that they're fun. If you feel like the conversation is starting to drag, first, don't panic. Just change the topic to something more fun, something more lighthearted. Now, here's where things get really interesting. You might think that by just having a great conversation, that that's enough. But there's actually a psychological trick that can make or break how someone remembers your entire interaction. And it all comes down to how you end things. So that's where step five comes in. This final step is about leaving on a high note and making sure that your conversation bridge is strong enough to make sure that this interaction is not forgettable. Right? It's not like, oh, we just talked about small talk for 20 minutes and then they left. I don't even remember this person's name. I just know the weather. And to understand how important this step is, let me tell you something. Scientists actually found this pretty fascinating thing called the peak and rule. Basically people remember experiences based on two key moments. The most intense point, which is the peak, and how it ends, how it wraps up. This means that the way that you conclude a conversation can make or break how someone remembers your entire interaction. So if it started off really well and then it just died off, they're going to remember that it just wasn't that great. But if it started off really well and it started to die it off and you're like, you know what? I'm going to make it more lighthearted and then I'm going to leave. That's the way to do it. So to make this better, to make this easier, I'm going to give you a three step process that masters this rule. And by the way, I'm giving you these rules as a beginner guide, right? I don't want you to sit there and look at your notes when you have a conversation. Three step rule. Okay, cool. Let me look at real. It's not about that. It's just about getting it started for your first conversations over the next few weeks and then you can let that go and it's just going to be ingrained into your mind. First, when you're wrapping up the conversation, start by giving a specific unique compliment based on what you've discussed. So it could be, you know, say, I got to say, like, I really liked the passion that you have for photography. Like you have great energy. I can really feel it. Really nice to meet you and leave. This creates that positive emotional peak, right? And the person's going to remember that. And if you want to see this person again, you can just plant the seed for a future interaction, for a future meeting. If it's something that you want to pursue, right? So, here's the key. Make sure that it's relevant to what you've talked about. So you don't want to come off as random or pushy. For example, if you've been chatting about coffee, you might say, you know, I'm definitely checking out this new coffee shop that you mentioned next week. If you want to come, let me know on Instagram. I'll hit you up. I'll send you a message, right? Maybe we can meet there. This leaves them with this like sense of excitement for what's to come. And it's something that you already talked about. You talked about coffee. So it keeps things relaxed. It was related to what you're talking about. And it's so low effort. You don't even really have to think about it. And to end it, honestly, just express how much you've enjoyed the conversation. Be honest, let them know that you need to head out. Hey, you know, I got to go. I can't emphasize this enough. Do not overstay your welcome. Don't start the conversation off strong. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, connect and then let the conversation die down until it becomes a boring. Make sure to leave on a high note and it can be so simple. Just say, hey, great chat. I got to run now, but let's definitely continue this another time. And that's it. the interaction on a high note. It makes you look like you got place to be. You're busy. You're not just like lingering, right? It allows you to leave while the energy is still up, still high, as opposed to letting you drag for too long. And then you just kind of like, okay, this isn't working. I'm going to leave. That's that makes it weird. It makes it cringey. By the way, if it went really well and you want to meet up again, I highly recommend, and this is for romantic situations or going on a date or whatever, or a business relationships, send them a follow up message within 24 hours. And in the message mentioned something specific that you guys talked about, it shows that you were really listening and it reinforces that positive interaction that you've had. And guess what? Now you've built a fully functional conversation bridge to interact with anyone, anywhere, anytime. But what if, while you're having this conversation, a girl in the room keeps looking at you? Check out this video and I'll show you exactly what to do."

        "transcript": " Facing failure head on and admitting defeat is never easy, especially when it involves something that you poured your heart and soul into. It's a hard pill to swallow, right? It's humbling and it's incredibly difficult. But in this case, honesty and transparency is crucial, especially when we've built such a great relationship here between us. I've been posting videos on YouTube for over a decade, so it's hard enough for me to make this decision, but it's just as hard, if not harder, to acknowledge it to you. The guys watching my videos, following my journey on social media, and of course supporting my brand's 40 series, Apricus and ATOS. But today I want to share some important news with you all. As many of you know, the journey of a startup isn't easy, right? There's a lot of highs, a lot of lows, about 90% of startup fails. And 20% of those, by the way, don't even make it past the first year. 50% of those fail by their fifth year. Now we launched in March of 2022. So we're becoming a part of that statistic. Now the goal for me was to create a brand that was trusted by first and foremost, my audience. You guys watching this video. Then of course, to grow it outside of my immediate audience, to reach guys all over the world who maybe have never heard of me. I wanted this to be much bigger than me. And when we launched, we did really well. We sold a ton of product subscriptions to the Proficiency Set, which includes the face wash, the moisturizer, the face scrub. We got a ton of cool visuals to show our customers that these products are special, made in the US from high quality ingredients, they're results driven. And you can look at our reviews and you can see they're great. Right, average of four and a half stars out of five. That was a huge success to me. It made me super happy and my team was extremely happy too. And for a while, the sales kept coming in, they kept rolling in. It was profitable from the start, customer feedback was excellent. And so we kept going with apricot skincare, my skincare brand. And the goal when I started apricot was to help men finally achieve great skin because I know what it's like to have pimples and bad skin and feel like people are just staring at that zit on your forehead or your nose. Not only that, but I wanted to educate men on more forward products. And that's why I launched tinted moisturizers, which is one of my favorite products because it comes out white and then it adapts to your skin and hides any imperfections. Men don't typically wear tinted moisturizers and I thought, man, imagine, just imagine if men all over the world found out what a great hack that is. It's so helpful to have this when your skin isn't looking good that day, right? Just use this thing, boom, you're good to go. Then we came out with the Iceium, which is another product that a lot of men don't use, right? It depuffs your eyes, gets rid of eye bags, great for guys with dark circles, who maybe had a long night, looked tired the next day. But again, not really a product that guys typically use. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. The launches for those products were disappointing. And look, I knew that I wasn't gonna change every guy's behaviors and habits by launching these products. But I thought word would spread out quickly and these products would become more and more of everyone's favorites, just like it did for me. So I launched them, but the numbers were mediocre off the gate, but I thought I could just continue to market it. I just needed to get the word out there, so that men who had never tried these before would try them for the first time, get hooked, because who wouldn't want a product that could hide pimples or wrinkles in five seconds? And I mean, that was just my train of thought. I promoted the brand, I promoted the products all over social media, we spent money on Facebook ads, TikTok ads, influencer partnerships. I posted it on my channel, right? My Instagram, TikTok, and of course, the products sold, it was okay, but it didn't sell as much as we wanted. We had good profits, we had great customer reviews and feedback, but there was one thing we didn't consider. And this one thing cost us everything in the end. It was actually a big oversight, and it's the whole reason why I'm shutting down Apricot Skincare for good. Now the amount of work going into these marketing strategies to push the brand, the amount of work going into product development, which sometimes takes us over 12 months, the amount of time we were spending on emails for our customers, ads, website development, social media strategies, accounting, all of that time was going into Apricot Skincare instead of my largest and most well-known brand, Forte Series. It takes the same amount of time to shoot a campaign for Africa, then it does for Forte, but the difference is Forte is just way bigger. We get much larger return on investment by putting that time into Forte because it's an established brand because it's getting to that point where Forte is a standalone brand that doesn't need me to survive. A lot of men use these products without even knowing that I even exist. And that realization hit me hard. And it was obvious to me and my team that by spreading ourselves too thin, cross multiple brands, I wasn't giving Forte the attention and the resources that it deserved. Forte is my golden brand, the one that has a deep connection with a larger audience and it's the brand that has the potential to grow even more without my constant involvement. And by the way, this isn't just about numbers or profits. This is about focusing on what can bring the most value to you, my audience, and ensuring that we do it exceptionally well. So you know, after a long discussion with my team, and by long, I mean months long, we've been talking about this for a very long time. these are some really difficult conversations. We decided that it was best to sunset to shut down Africa's skincare. And I know this change might come as a surprise for many of you who love the brand, you know, who still buy from the brand and might be disappointing. And for that, I wanna say I'm sorry, I apologize. Your support has been incredible. And I deeply appreciate every single one of you who trusted Africa's with your skincare routine. The high ratings, the positive feedback that we received, they're really a testament to the quality of the products and our customer support. And I don't take that lightly. I really appreciate that. Our team, the employees, the contractors, everyone's staying on board. I'm not letting anyone go, which was a worst case scenario for me. I don't know what I would have done if I had to let go of an entire team because of a mistake that could have been avoided. So everyone is staying on board, which is amazing. And the way that we're able to do that is by actually taking apricot skincare and folding it under Forte series. So you can see that the apricot products are now listed on the Forte website until we sell out. Once they sell out, will be fully gone, will be fully done with the brand forever. This isn't about giving up, it's about making strategic decisions for long-term success, making sure that the business is sustainable. If you're subscribed to Apericus products and you get your products delivered every month, your last delivery will be next month in August. We've allocated just enough stock for our subscribers until then. You have a very, very limited amount of stock left of those products. They are sold out, so you can't buy them, but if you're a subscriber, you're going to get one more month and then they're gone forever. We're never gonna make these products ever again, which is a weird thing to say, weird thing to come to terms to, but that's just the nature of the business and startups. You know, I have to make sure that the overall business is healthy. I have a team, I have a business partner. We wanna make sure that we are keeping everyone in the business, making sure that we're not letting anyone go and this is the toughest decision that I've ever had to make regarding one of my brands. You know, so this is what we're gonna do. Starting right now from the day I post this video, Every apricot's products is on sale for 25% off. The only products left are the tinted moisturizers and different shades in the eye cream. We don't have a lot of them and we're not ordering anymore. So if you're one of the guys that decided to try our tinted moisturizer or eye cream, then you probably liked the product. That's what I like to believe in because I know that I love them. It's hard not to like these products, but once they're gone, that's it. You're never gonna see another apricot skincare product ever again. And the goal here is to sell through all of it to give you guys a great deal and still be able to hopefully cover our costs. I never thought I'd be doing a going out of business sale, but hey, you know, we'll cross that off my business career. We'll mark it as a huge lesson learned for me and for the team, and we'll keep working hard on forte and my other businesses. I think a big lesson here is that even with a massive audience, even with lawyer subscribers, it doesn't mean that you can just make any business work. It's not easy. It takes a lot of strategy, blood, sweat, tears, and hard work and time. You know, if there's one thing that I'm proud of, Is it the fact that, man, I work hard. I've been working hard from literally the day I turned 14 years old. I've had a job and I have not stopped. And you guys have seen the majority of that journey here. You know, almost 15 years going strong on YouTube. That's a long time, man. That's a long time. Yeah, I bring you high level YouTube videos, Instagram, TikTok content, the best products I can make that actually make a difference in your lives. We're working on men's image lab. I have a ton of other things as well. The amount of love and support that you guys have given me, I don't take it for granted. And I've been working really hard to restructure the business to figure out the next steps and to keep moving forward. So what's next? Well, the goal is to launch skincare products in the near future under Forte series, but these products will be developed from scratch and will of course take everything that we've learned from Apricot and make the Forte products even better. But that's gonna take a while. So I wouldn't expect anything until maybe end of 2025 because these products take a while to make, to develop. And then we always test them with a bunch of, you know, long-term customers to make sure that they're perfect before we ever stock them. So once these products are sold out, I wouldn't expect any skincare products under Forte. We're obviously apricots for a long time. Now the first step in this transition was the release of the Forte series face mask. It's our first skincare product under the Forte brand. We just launched it a few weeks ago and it's actually receiving fantastic feedback but like I said, it'll be a long time before we launch any more skincare products under the Forte series brand. You know it's kind of weird. I haven't really had a conversation like this with you guys in a while and I wish it was under better circumstances. I wish it was good news or a fun announcement but I think there's a lot of value in keeping it real with you and opening up and letting you know that there's a lot going on behind the scenes right. After I shut the cameras off it's not like I make these little YouTube videos then I go away. YouTube is becoming more and more complicated. The team is becoming bigger and bigger. My brands are becoming bigger and bigger and it's there's a lot going on and I hope you understand this decision wasn't easy. I was actually, to be quite frank, dreading this video. Dreading this video, I'm like, man, I'm gonna have to tell them, I'm gonna have to talk to them. This is, I don't know, I felt embarrassed or just worried or annoyed, frustrated, but it had to happen, right? All I have here in this digital world is my word. And it's really important to me to keep it real with you, whether you started watching my videos 10 years ago, or this is your first video, hopefully this isn't your first video, this is a bad I wanted to start with, this is the level of honesty that I always want to have with you if you're watching my videos. And I've been so busy, so focused on creating these businesses that I feel like I haven't really even had time to kind of sit down, have a conversation with you, especially the guys that have been watching me for a while. So if you've always wanted to try the Apricot's products, this is your last chance. The final say was happening right now. You can shop at apricotskincare.com, but honestly, maybe for like another month because we're gonna shut down that website. Everything is gonna be under 4taseries.com. I'm gonna link it below. And I'm gonna keep a few of these products, the Apricot products at home as memories because it was a good run. It was a, I have great memories of launching this brand, using the brand every day, promoting it. And I'm proud of what we've done, but it's time to move on. And Forte Series is the future for me. So thank you guys so much for watching. Thank you for your support. I appreciate you and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Today, we're at Wempe Jewelers in New York City with a very special guest, businessman, entrepreneur, investor, and TV personality, Kevin O'Laren. [\"Just Spectacular\"] Just spectacular. Kevin isn't just a shark. He's a watch collector, a watch connoisseur, and today he's dropping some knowledge and helping us pick out three watches for three outfits that I picked out. Now of course, there's a catch. There's some parameters he's gonna have to find out very soon. Let's see how he does. Kevin, you're a businessman through and through. You love wearing sharp suits. You look great. And here's the thing, my audience loves to look great too. And there's nothing that makes you look as good as when you're wearing a suit, right? Yeah, I agree. When you're talking business, put a tie on it. I even heard that people don't like it when you don't wear a suit. This is like, it's like your thing. Well, it's become my Shark Tank uniform. And I do it for the consistency continuity it's called in television. So they can cut one episode to another across years. So it's always the same, red bands on the watches. I wear two watches now, New York and Abu Dhabi Time, and then Red Poof, usually, and I happen to have one, a red pen. Oh, I haven't seen the red pen yet. Yeah, yeah, this is an architectural pen made by Mont Blanc. They don't make it any more, but it's perfect. But I think matching, mint can only do so much. They don't wear a lot of jewelry. So you want to look good. Especially because they have the classy black suit, top of red, I think it goes really well. But for this first watch that you're picking, I know you like your red bands, but we're going to stick with a classic leather strap. And we're just trying to help my audience out to see what they would choose if they were wearing this suit right here. That suit? Okay, immediately I'm going to go for a gold case, a yellow gold case that's going to work perfectly with that. There's one more parameter that you have to stick to, less than 20 grand. I can do that. Well, I'm gonna go to Tudor. I'm gonna look at Breitling. I'm gonna look at Panerai. There's a lot of optionality. But for that particular suit, I'm already putting a covenant on it. It's gotta have elements of gold. And by the way, gold is smoking hot again. Smoking hot. I used to wear only silver. The little Kar-Chee right there? Yeah, I used to wear only silver. That's a classic. And then I got this watch and now I pretty much only wear gold. Yeah, I happen to be wearing the Kar-Chee as well. Have you heard of the Kar-Chee Crash? It's platinum. And of course to match the platinum, I've done something with the, I've done the same with this cuff link, but because I'm wearing gold on this side, it's the same cuff like in gold. So. Oh no way. Absolutely. That's the next level. No, listen, this is definitely, listen, I'm not messing around. Okay, no, I see that. Exactly. And then in your wedding band also. Car Che. It has the three different. I'm really, I'm really getting back to the Maison de Car Che these days because they're bringing such interesting designs. The classic you're wearing there, a lot of the panther stuff, the Santos, Santos Dumont they're bringing, which goes first time, crazy. These are the wonderful things about watch collecting and also for fashion, which I think is a great intersection that you're bringing forward here. But for that suit, it's going to have to be gold. You've already realized that, you're already wearing it. I know, I know, but it can't be this one, it's got to be something different. Yeah, that's absolutely. It's a shopping. Okay, so let's do that. I mean, this weapon is so amazing. They've got everything here, right? They really do. literally everything. Yeah. And we can go anywhere you want. This German brand is so underappreciated in America. The quality of the watches and the price points. So let's start right over there. These are some of the most spectacular dials you can get in classic vintage looks. What's the price point? Right. Wow. People do not know this make. This brand they don't know, but I'm telling you how much? 18,500. There you have it. Nailed that. Right out of the case. Can you nail that? No, let's see. The point is that wash under another brand would be $30,000. Because of the worksmanship that goes into it? I'm always about the dial. That's where I start. But I'm saying if you're going to step up and spend $20,000, you want really fine craftsmanship. And then in the case of this piece, you want to feel that crunch. They have such amazing calibers. It's beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. This brand's on fire right now. They just brought a pink one out. Which... Yeah, have you seen that yet? I have one. Oh, you have one? Yeah. One of the first ones that's out there. I am the first one. Question for you. So, when it comes to watches, there's a lot of rules I feel like. A lot of people think there's rules. Yeah. You obviously break those rules with wearing two bracelets. I do. To watch. I do, yeah. What are some of the watch rules that you think are just nonsense? Well, number one, number one, never buy a watch you can't afford. Do not use debt to buy watches. watch collecting is a disease, you should realize that's what it is. If you can't afford that piece, do not put it on some sort of credit because that is a very bad outcome. So you have to build your collection based on your successes in life and each one marks those successes. Buy watches around success in life, whatever it is, you're getting married, you have a child, got a new job, you did a deal or something. Secondly, you've got to love the dial. You don't need a watch anymore to tell time. Oh, it is. With black bay. That's nice. Yeah. For a sporty look, I like it for this suit. That's a great one. I like it. Good size too. You like the one you like. Yeah. Who launched? Price point on this thing? 46. It has to be leather. And a strap. It has to be leather. It can be adopted. Yes, it could be. Yeah, because am I allowed to do that? Yeah. That's fair because this actually tutors do allow you to put on a different strap. I mean, it sort of works. Sort of works. I'm going to make this number two. And the price point is, I've always, this is probably one of the very best. entry-level brands in the world. The quality is insane. But let's make this our number two. Okay. Okay, great. So for my third pick, again, a gold case, Jagdkutra is a spectacular brand that is actually established in the U.S. It's known for its Reverso, but Reverso's are well north of $20,000 now. But they are such great watchmakers and classic dial designers. And so I'm gonna go with this, which is just at $20,000. Absolutely beautiful. And I think it's gonna really work with that suit. Great dial size too, and the grey dial fold. Perfect, perfect. All right, amazing. That is a spectacular piece. Okay, so for this next watch, and this next outfit, I'm wearing all black. Yeah. All right, you have to keep it under 10,000. I know you have some very expensive watches, but I want to make sure that my audience can also afford some of these watches. Maybe they're buying their first watch, maybe they're buying, you know, their second watch, and they're not really at a point where they can get one of these beautiful pieces yet. What can you get us? Well, let me start. I love the idea of bringing down the price point, because last year one of, you know, I do a lot around watches and on social media and I got this message from someone who said, hey, Kevin, why is it all you show us is rich as a whole watches that I can't afford? I wanna be a collector too. I'm only 22 years old. Why don't you start showing me how I enter the craft? How do I start getting interested in neurology? But don't give me this one of a kind million dollar watch all the time. I'm sick of listening to that because I can't buy that. And it hit me like a ton of bricks. So I spend a third of my time now working on entry-level ideas, because he's 100% right. And now you're giving me the challenge. We're moving down to price point 10,000. There are still amazing watches to be found with amazing brands you know. Because even the brands themselves understand to perpetuate success, they have to bring a whole new generation in. And to do that, they got to come in at those price points under 10,000. So they're bringing great stuff to the market and we're gonna find three fantastic pieces. Let's go to work. And these are like gateway watches, right? They get you really addicted to collecting and getting into watches. And the brand that you buy first becomes an emotional purchase the rest of your life. And you're gonna stay with that brand. And they know that. They're gonna have somebody with them for 40, 50 years, buying their way up through their lives. I'm curious now, what was your gateway watch that got you into watches? $5,000, Cartier Panther. Wow. I still have it. You still have it. I still have it. You still wear it? All the time. I got it in 1986. So, and I ended up in 1990 getting a Cartier band, and I've stayed with Cartier my whole life. That's the other great thing about Cartier. A brand like that is gonna stay in the family. And so you should always think about who's next. Even on your entry level watch, there's so many great watches that under 10. So let's go to work and find through it. All right, maybe we start a Cartier. Why not? We just talked it up. They have spectacular pieces. One caught my eye in Geneva. This new dial is so, this gradient dial, moving in these rich colors on a steel brand, like a band like that, that's gonna be under 10,000, I think it's gonna be perfect for our first pick. Black and red really work. I mean... You would know. Well, I'm doing it right now. And I saw that band, and it's got complications. It's a Longine, which is a spectacular entry-level watch. It's a great brand. Let's take this red band out here. That's a 34, I think. That's gonna be a great price and a great watch. What are we talking about other price, boy? 3,000, 75. Look at it, though. Look at it. Look how fantastic it looks in black. Look at that dial. I mean, come on. Look at the detail in that dial. It's really great. Beautiful piece. And red and black work so well together. Would you say this is a good entry watch for somebody buying their first luxury watch? I would always recommend the first watch because, you know, you can do his and hers, too. If you're doing something and you're getting engaged or something and you really have a tight budget, They make great women's watches, they make great men's watches, but that is a particularly clean look. That's our number two. We need one more at under 10,000. What about this over here in the black band? I wonder if that's under 10. It might be. It might be. It's a steel case. 4,600. Boom. Now, I want to talk about a brand that's very established. I remember we're looking under 10,000 with an elegant look and a really remarkable dial that's going to work in black, black band on here. These guys, Bob and Michiel, are so well known in Europe, and I think getting more appreciated here domestically. So I think we found three fantastic pieces from brands that are gonna be around forever. I have another interesting question for you about that. Do you actually get your sleeves shortened so that you can see the watches when you're wearing your suits? It's a great question. What I do, I don't shorten them, but I actually add half an inch of diameter So it can slide over the watch in concealment. You see that? And then if I want to bring it out, boom. And so, you know. Have it down, the movement and everything. The whole idea. Because sometimes if you're walking on the street, you want to conceal your piece, you know. And then we come and we meet, wow, out come the big guns, right? That's, those are our big guns, let me say. Yeah, I'm crazy about the crash. This is the second day. This is the first one released by the company worldwide. And I'm just sizing the band, I'm still working on it. Well, I hear a rumor that you wear four watches a day. I actually wear six. I do the morning, lunch I switch, and then at night, if I'm going out, I really amp it up. Like tonight, when I go out tonight, I'm hosting a dinner, I'm coming out blazing. What are you wearing tonight? I'm probably gonna go, because I know one of these people is your own collector, so I'm gonna probably bring a joran, but everybody wants to see the crash, so I'll include that. All right, what's next? for this next challenge, Kevin. Yeah. You going on vacation? Do you ever go on vacation? All the time. I try and combine work with vacation. I go to so amazing. Got it. Like we were in Egypt together. Yeah, that was incredible. It was. Incredible. We connected over watches and we got, we're doing this because of that, because we were talking about watches. Well, that's the whole idea. Watches brought us together and now we're making this. This is terrific. That's my whole idea about watches. It creates friendships, relationships and conversations start. And that's what I want to talk to you about when you're going on vacation. The watches that you bring, right there, they may be a little bit more funky, more fun, a little different, more casual. Right. Today I'm wearing a kind of a relaxed vacation outfit. Yes. And I would love for you to find me three vacation watches and choose one of them. What's the price point? Anything you want. Okay. What we want to find here, if you're giving me any price, is something that is sporty, but at the same time, if you're going out for dinner that night and you're putting on something a little more high end, it still looks great. So that's a crossover. A diver could do it, a diver watch could do it, because you get some beautiful designs there. But it's also ready the next day to dive in the ocean. Because I don't have a budget, I'm gonna go look at Tudor Makes Great Divers. There's a few brands, so let's just- Just walk around and see what we find. Yeah, that's a very interesting piece. It's sporty, it's a chronograph, it's got an interesting dial, it's definitely a holiday watch because it's probably waterproof. Love the gold. Yeah, I love gold, I love gold. Does this GP have a screw down crown on it? Is that waterproof? Yes. Is it a screw down crown? Uh-huh. Okay, can I have one? I wear one myself. Oh, that's nice. Oh, look at that. Can I have a look at that, please? Absolutely. You know, the thing about this is it's very elegant, but it's also very sporty, and it's not gonna be cheap. What are we talking on, Price? It is, for the nice. $41,600. Yeah, no, it's, but look, it's a hunk of gold. You're walking around the gold bar here. But it's a very... I mean, just look at how this is gonna look. You're sitting at the bar having a cocktail four o'clock. You're making a hell of a statement. Yeah, you are. But you don't have to take the piece off. You could go with a rubber band so that it stays on. You're not gonna lose it on the beach. You're gonna jump in the ocean, go for a swim. It's still good. That's one of the things about holiday watches. You do not wanna take them off your wrist if you don't have to. You leave it at the pool by mistake, and you're walking around with a gold bar on here, but it's a big statement piece. All eyes on you. Yeah. How many watches do you bring when you go on vacation? 12 to 17. Really? Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. How do you even choose? Well, that's why I started Wonder Care, the insurance company, because I only want to ensure the watches I'm traveling with, and I want to turn the insurance off and on. And the watch insurance market didn't have that product. So I'm launching it. I've done a lot of work. I'm a big investor in the company. It's doing it. OK. Let's do one or two more. This Nardine is very interesting because it's carbon. It's got a rubber band already. You don't have to change it. It's a dive watch, so it's going to stay on your wrist. And it really is, it's kind of not whimsical, but elegantly funny, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. And so people are gonna see it from yards away and say, what, I love a watch, it makes people say, what the hell is that? But that is inherently what a vacation watch should be in a way, right? You're having fun, you're wearing something that you wouldn't normally wear to the office, right? Yeah, it's definitely, but it's great that, like a blue band like that, and I change it to red, but it works because you've got these elements on the dial that makes it pop. color. Smart watchmakers now are giving men fashion options. This is a fashion option. The band matches these little elements. Even on the dial. Brilliant. See this little end here? Yeah. But a pure dive watch which is what you want on a holiday. So here's an option from a brand that is really got a beautiful kind of fashion I like this because it's probably as a vacation watch, the most elegant direction you can go in. But at the same time, screw down crown waterproof, a band that can get wet with ocean water, no problem, right out of the gate, and it's going to be very, very striking. And I love the texture on not only just the bracelet, but also the dial when it comes out. Yeah, this is a very fashion forward idea for a holiday watch. Beautiful gold. And such a clean dial, too. Just texture, little logo. I was just thinking, I should get a job as a sales guy in Wempe. That's what I think. Do we have an offer here? Yeah, I should be head of sales here. Yeah, exactly. What can you start with? Do you want to vote? All right, so we found the watches. Now we're going to go downstairs and choose and reveal the exact watches that you like. Not hard to do this in Wempe. This is like a candy store for brands. They have it everywhere. It's fantastic. We've really gone right through all the price points and come up with fantastic fashion statements. All right, let's see what we got. Alright, now it's time for the big reveal. Kevin, as we sit here next to the safe, there'll be a ton of expensive watches in there. Maybe we can find a way to get in there at some point. But for this one, you had to stick within a budget of 20K and find something with a leather bracelet, leather band. And I think you did a really good job here. Really like the Nomos that you showed me earlier, but ultimately the choice is up to you. What's it gonna be? Yeah, this is really tough because I'm a huge fan of what Tudor has been doing. That's beautiful. I mean, that is such an elegant piece. It's spectacular. Guescheite, German. Are we going German? Yeah. OK. I mean, this is a really spectacular piece. I love that piece. And a brand that people don't appreciate. It's so well made and it's just getting traction in the US, but it's really well known in Europe. And so you don't have to buy a Swiss watch all the time. Yeah. But in terms of what's on this, look, these are all great. I mean, they're all great. And it's particularly the tutors. But the winner in the under 20 category for the most value, it's this. You know, it's great seeing you promote this brand and talk so highly of this brand as well, because it's typically when you think of a watch under 20 grand, you think, yeah, I've got to go Rolex, right? I've got to go. Yeah, yeah, it's true. but you also should realize that there are some very good watchmakers. And you can stand out in the crowd with something unique. And also you've got a dial here that's got a vintage modern art deco-y kind of vibe, which really pops when people see it on your wrist, they go, wow, what is that? I'm looking for the, what is that factor? Like that's very important because look, I've got a lot of Rolexes and they're great watches, but so do many other people. So I'm looking for what does, What can I get on a dial that no one else has that I'm not going to see on the street today? You know miss uniqueness. This is unique and it says a lot about you when you have something like it really does Yeah, anyways great pick. That's the best of show All right, so now we have this all-black outfit and you actually were able to find three amazing watches under 10k Cartier we have longin and we have vom and mercier. Yeah, so Which one are you going with? So let me tell you my thinking on this. Very important to have entry level prices. And some of them are under $5,000, but whatever you can afford, you set the market 10. So these are extraordinarily good brands, all of them. Every one of these is worth every dollar in terms of the quality of the mechanics, the support the brand has, the longevity they've been around. They're all been around for a long time. But what really caught my eye, and by the way, the Longine is beautiful too. It is beautiful. At least expensive. I think this is a women's watch, right? Well, that's not true anymore with 34 to 30 years. I was going to say, but it works. It works really well. I like the smaller dial. I mean, I like the pressure stones. It looks really good. And I do like it's kind of like a pearl dial. I'm not scared of buying a 34 anymore. No. I wear lots of 34s. As a matter of fact, if you go back and look at vintage Patek's even, that costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. There's a lot of 34s in there. Tiny, tiny calibers. So that's really what that, why I got that. But the one that for me wanted, and I saw this first at Watches and Wonders, this car chair for under 10. And it does have, you can swap it out for a band because that was one of the covenants you had. You wanted a band, you got a band. But you also, you get the steel bracelet, which is so classic car chair. I mean, you can't go wrong with it. This is such a beauty. And this is one of their new ones. I was actually checking this out before you came in today. No, it's an eye grab. I mean, you can't, you can't stop. It's gonna work with black because you really got this fantastic grating in the dial that really accentuates. That could work with white, it could work with black, it could go with grey suit, whatever you want. Now that I know your love for Cartier, this watch is even more special. Yeah, well thank you. I just love the brand. Again, I'm wearing a Cartier, so can't complain. Alright, so we have three beautiful vacation watches. So, you know, this is tough because I love whimsical ideas and this blue is fantastic. You listen to Ardinas, they're all great brands, but I tell you, I fell in love with this. I knew you were going to pick that one. Yeah, I mean the dial is insane, it's clean, it's such a spectacular look, and it's going to be popular forever. And you see that coming from so far. Miles away, people are going to look at your wrist. That's what you want, you want wrist appeal. You do. You want something really, really, really, that's it. That's the one. That's the one. Yeah. This is heavy and even though you can see it from far away. It's it doesn't look like insanely flashy It's not you know, it's not arrogant arrogant. It's just elegant, right? That's the way to describe that watch. I love that and that really is the combination of the the classic look The GP has the heritage. They've never been ostentatious in anything they do but Consonant, you know wrist, that's what it is and everything about it is perfect the price is up there though. Yeah, so we're looking at $41,600 for this one. But that's a really great vacation. Yeah, it's gonna be a good vacation. Kevin, thank you so much for watch shopping with me and showing my audience what kind of watches they should be getting according to those three outfits. It's a pleasure getting to know you and hearing all your knowledge about watches truly. And I'm glad we met through watches to talk about watches. But what I like about what you're doing, which I think is very important, men's fashion, and watches should be part of that narrative. When you are, you know, when I buy a suit, I'm thinking watches, like what am I gonna wear with this? And that was the whole idea you had, which is exactly what I do. So I agree with you and I think when you're buying watches, as we learned today, it's dial, dial, dial. You gotta love the dial, it's gotta work with what you're trying to say, what your factual statement is. So I really enjoyed working with you. Thank you so much guys. Make sure to check out Kevin's channel. He's about to hit a million subscribers on YouTube. He's at 906 or so so we can get him there. I'm gonna leave that link below. Kevin, thank you so much for talking about it. I really appreciate it. Thank you, thank you. See you soon."

        "transcript": " My style sucked until very late in my 20s. I didn't feel good about my outfits. I had no idea what I was doing and I didn't have the funds to buy what I wanted to wear. I remember when I turned 29, it was the first time in my life that I felt like I truly found my style. Looking back now, it was dog, but it doesn't matter because I felt really good wearing those outfits. And a lot of men go through their entire lives without finding their style. And I want to change that. I want you to look great and feel confident in your style choices, no matter your age. So today I want to talk to the guys in their 30s or above who maybe think they're too old to experiment to try new styles Because of their age. Let me tell you something at 35. I can confidently say that I feel better than ever I have financial and location freedom. I figured out my style I figured out my hair and my grooming I feel good and I want you to do the exact same thing So this video is for you Especially if you're in your 30s and you think you're too old to try new things a new style a new haircut a new look You're absolutely wrong and I'm about to show you why by the way if you're not in your 30s yet But like class year outfits You're gonna like this video too and by the end of this video You're gonna learn how to upgrade five important areas of your style and the very first thing you're gonna have to do is assess Your wardrobe because I can guarantee you have some pieces in there that don't belong in there And you know what to maybe it's a jacket that you got four years ago and you loved it You wore the crap out of it back then it's a nice jacket, but you haven't touched it in forever Maybe it's not your style anymore or you got a new one. It doesn't really matter at that point. It's just a memory Right, you're just remembering those moments that you wore that jacket in now Take a second right now to think about all of those items in your closet because I know I have a few of those and Anytime I get rid of old clothes that I don't wear anymore It opens up space for new items that I will actually wear I cleanse my closet pretty often and I list those pieces on my posh mark by the way for a fraction of the price So I'll link that below for you So I'm going to give you a simple trick that will tell you which clothes to get rid of when it's time to declutter your wardrobe. You're going to start by hanging all of your clothes with the hanger facing the same direction. Each time that you wear an item, when you put it back, turn the hanger in the opposite direction. Give it a few months and you're going to see exactly which clothes you haven't worn at all. The hangers that haven't been flipped are your candidates for donation or selling or whatever you want to do with them. And be honest with yourself, get rid of the clothes you're not wearing. It makes no sense to keep them. It's just hoarding and it gets in your way. This not only simplifies the decision-making process, but it also helps you visually track the clothes that you're wearing, making it easier to keep your wardrobe more organized and more functional. Now you have room to start upgrading your style and the second step is to do exactly what you're doing right now, but with more purpose. Now, maybe you clicked on this video because it showed up on your YouTube homepage or it was recommended, but you weren't really looking for this video. If that's you, then take some time to be intentional with your style upgrades. And here's a three step guide on how to do that. Number one, of course, shameless plug. Alright, subscribe to this channel so you can learn as much as possible about style. My goal here has always been to help you. This channel is about your journey. Number two, follow other men's fashion creators that have a style that you like. So if you like street style, find those guys. If you're into suits, there's a ton of guys that talk about that specifically. If you like to be fashion forward, same thing. Just like with everything else in life, with style, you have to know what you want in order to achieve it. So what is your dream style? You need to know in order to get there, right? In step number three, once you have a style or two in mind, then find brands that offer those styles. Every brand has something different to offer. And these are the elements that you should keep in mind as you're searching for the right brands. First is the overall aesthetic. Classy versus street versus edgy versus athleisure. And look, of course you can have more than one aesthetic, right? You can wear classy outfits all week long, then at leisure on the weekends, but focus on nailing down one aesthetic before you start working on the next. Then you have to think about what you want that brand to represent when you're wearing it. For example, if you're wearing logos, those logos, they say something about you. Nike or Adidas might say that you're into sports. Gucci might say that you're into really high end designer s***. of God says that you're into fashion forward street style. And of course, you can go with no logos, right? And just focus on the aesthetic of the brand. Next is the fit. What brands fit you well? This is the hardest part to figure out. It's going to take you some trial and error, but it's worth it. Assess your body type, understand it well, and then find a few brands that make clothes for your body type. And please, please, please no matter what promise me this, once you find the first brand that fits you well, don't. And I repeat, Do not buy all the same shirts and pants in different colors. Men tend to do that, right? And it's just lazy. Find a few brands that you like, not just one. It's okay to buy the same piece in a couple of different colors, but don't build a whole wardrobe with the same exact pieces. That's lazy and that's boring. And finally, your budget. The price range of the items that you can afford. Do not go into credit card debt just to buy a couple of pieces from a designer brand, find alternatives that are within your budget. Nowadays, there's a ton of brands that offer stylish pieces and that are within your budget. KooFandy is a great example of that, especially if you're in your 30s and you like to wear classier styles like I do. For reference, I'm 5'9\", 165 pounds, and I wear a size medium in these tops. I got a bunch of them for the summer, and believe it or not, they all go for less than $30 each. Some of them for even less than 20 bucks. They don't feel like it. They feel soft, they fit really well, and they look more expensive than they really are. And my favorite right now from KooFandi is the knit button down short sleeve polo because I'll be wearing these a lot. They're classy, they're summery, and they're affordable. You can't go wrong with them. But I also like this white button down here with the cool design. This one's perfect for that hot summer day. I like this blue polo which is a little bit more dressy. You can wear it for a daytime or a nighttime outfit. And KooFandi by the way doesn't just make these polos. Alright, I know I'm showing a lot of polos, but that's just because of my style right now but they also have casual t-shirts. They have suits, which I've shown here on the channel before, underwear, beachwear, sportswear. So definitely check out their website and their Amazon store because with my discount code in the link below, you get up to 30% off the already very affordable price. So basically you're paying less than $20 for a nice summer shirt, which is pretty much unheard of. Now that you have a list of the brands that fit your aesthetic, that represent who you are and that are within your budget, it's time to get specific with my style recommendations. Now, as you transition from your twenties to your thirties, your style should evolve to reflect not just your age, but the changes in your lifestyle. And, and this one is important, your aspirations, who you want to be, what you're trying to accomplish as you enter your thirties. The focus typically changes, right? It shifts towards maybe refining your wardrobe to something classier and more timeless, investing into quality over quantity. That becomes more important. Now, I went through my closet a few months ago and I cleared out so much that I never war, a bunch of sweatpants, hoodies, graphic tees, cross body bags, anything that wasn't me anymore is gone. And I started to replace those pieces with things that I actually like, things that I actually wear and that reflect who I am today and who I want to be. I'm a businessman, I'm 35 years old, I live in New York City, I'm on camera three to five times a week. That's who I am, so I need to dress appropriately. But you might be a creative, maybe you work in an office or you're a dad, maybe you want to command respect to your businessmen, a CEO with your style. And in your 30s, this is what I recommend you to wear. For tops, you should definitely start swapping your t-shirts for polos. You don't even have to get rid of all your t-shirts, as a matter of fact, don't. You need t-shirts. But polos are just going to be way classier and they make you look a lot more elevated, a lot more grown up. They're versatile, right? You can literally wear them, dress them up with a pair of trousers, dress them down with shorts to start what I would say is stick to classic colors like navy white and black those are timeless right but you shouldn't only look at colors you also have to look at the fit which should be more tailored kind of like this not tight but definitely not baggy and then the fabric I like knit polos for the winter months or when it's colder out and cotton or cotton blends for warmer months just a side note here I've also been tucking in my polos a lot and I I like how classy it looks. It makes me feel good. And believe it or not, it even makes my posture better for some reason. Fitted T's are a must have for layering or just more of a casual look. Now, of course, polos are great, right? I've been wearing them a lot, but you're gonna wanna wear T's once in a while. And when you do, just make sure you're wearing the right T-shirts. My brand ATOS has high quality, well fitted options that enhance your physique, enhance your style. They're way better than the average T-shirt. There's no comparison. I also suggest you get some linen shirts in your 30s. It's the perfect summer top and I know what you're thinking. I'm crazy, right? You must be crazy, suggesting a long sleeve button down for summer, but here's the thing. With this shirt, you can unbutton it a few times. You can roll up the sleeves. It's made of linen, which is lightweight, not sticky and breathable. All of that makes it a lot more comfortable to wear in the summertime than a cotton t-shirt. And in terms of style, let's be honest, there's just no comparison, right? Linen shirts are more interesting. They're more grown up and overall, they're more stylish. So I mentioned I like to tuck in my polos. Well, specifically I like to tuck them into trousers with side tabs, side adjusters. So these side tab trousers, they basically eliminate the need for a belt. So it has a more clean, sophisticated look. And they're ideal for both formal and semi-formal occasions. I wear this combo all the time now. Literally this is like my uniform now. If I'm going out to a dinner, if I'm going out on a date or a business meeting, this is honestly a great look that any guy can pull off. So I highly recommend you start wearing something like this if you're in your 30s and you wanna elevate your look. Now, you could wear polos or linen shirts with chinos too, which are more casual, right? They don't really have the side tabs and they look great in pretty much any occasion. They're slightly more casual than the side tab trousers. And guess what? If you're more of a jeans guy, you can make them look good too, as long as you know how to style them properly. It's really all about making sure that you dress them up slightly so that you don't look lazy and you gotta nail that fit. So you want them to hug your thighs up here, but have a more loose fit from the bottom of your thighs all the way down to the ankles. Stay far, far away from skinny jeans or baggy jeans because those are trends that come and go, they're fads. And what we're looking for at this age is you want timeless classic styles, not fads, not trends that come and go. If you prefer shorts, you can wear shorts. But, and that's a big but, you have to wear the right shorts. The baggy basketball shorts, they're just not gonna cut it. Your workout shorts don't look good, right? You need five to seven inch inseam shorts made from cotton or linen if you wanna keep it more casual. And let's be honest, shorts are always casual, so one of these is always gonna be perfect. Go for a five inch if you wanna show more of your legs, seven inches if you prefer something a little bit longer. And I don't recommend going longer than a seven inch inseam. It's gonna make your legs look shorter than they really are, it's just not a good look. You should go for shorts that have a modern tailored look. Go for solid colors to keep it classy and make it easy to mix and match. Now onto footwear. One of my favorite topics, of course, to talk about, loafers definitely win the medal for casual elegance, right? They're comfortable, they're versatile, they work well with jeans, trousers, and even suits. I've been wearing them a lot with my suits lately. Invest in quality leather or suede pairs in classic colors like brown or black or maybe even gray if you're going for suede. And if you're still on the fence about wearing loafers, do me a favor right now, all right? Get yourself a pair, start wearing loafers instead of sneakers when you go out to a nice restaurant and just notice how much better your outfit is gonna look. They're classy, they're timeless, and on top of all of that, they're having a big moment right now. They're always in style, but especially right now. So this is the perfect time to try them out. Now besides loafers, I've been wearing a lot of white leather sneakers. You can go for all white or white with some details that make the shoes a little bit more interesting if you think all white is boring, which I do think it's boring sometimes. So I like the extra details. So you got your tops, which are polos, fitted T's and linen shirts. Got your bottoms, which are five to seven inch inseam shorts, trousers, chinos, or jeans. And we also have the footwear dial then, loafers, or white leather sneakers. But you also need grown up accessories, right? The first one being a watch. Now the price doesn't matter. I know when I talk about watches, a lot of people think they have to buy a Rolex or Audemars Piguet or something crazy. But the type of watch does matter. Don't get these massive, heavy watches that look like you're a power ranger, okay? Go for a classic watch, like a diver, a tank style watch like this, a leather bracelet, or you can even go for a chronograph if that's more your style. It's really all about making sure that it's classy, not too big. Personally, I don't go any bigger than a 40 millimeter dial. Of course, it depends on your wrist size, but for me, it's just, it's too big, it's too clunky. Also, a simple understated necklace, right? Can add a really nice personal touch to your outfit. I really like wearing a simple necklace when I'm wearing anything that's open. It just shows, it basically fills out that real estate right here. It's a conversation starter and it just adds a little bit of, if you're a gold, a little bit of bling, if you're a silver, a little shine, I think it looks really good and every guy should have at least one necklace that they can just comfortably throw on if you're going out on a summer day and then wearing a white linen shirt that's open. Now a ring can also be pretty subtle, right? But it stands out. I have nothing else going on on this arm here besides this one ring. So what I like to do is typically I'll do one necklace, I'll do a watch and I'll do a ring and you can get a simple band or you can get something a little slightly more fun, more complicated or more edgy if that's more of your style. Lately I've been wearing a lot of gold. You can see the gold watch and the gold ring, but honestly I went through a very long silver face. So I think I just got bored. I also do think that gold is trending right now. Just try both of them out, gold and silver. See what looks best on your skin tone and what makes you feel more comfortable and go with that. I talk about a lot here on the channel, but it really changes the way that I feel is fragrances, right? Invest in fragrances that make you feel confident that make you feel attractive and fragrances are pretty subjective So I'm not gonna tell you exactly which ones you should get because it really depends on what you like But try to stay away from anything too childish. For example, Abercrombie Fierce, right? Which by the way, it's a great scent I love Abercrombie Fierce. It reminds me of when I was younger, but if you're in your 30s, maybe it's a little bit too young for you I don't wear it. I own it. I just don't wear it because it's not really my style and my age anymore. But of course, none of that matters unless you have the right hairstyle to bring it all together. That's why I made this video right here on the best hairstyles according to your age. So click right here and find out which hairstyle will make you look your best."

        "transcript": " Someone told me a long time ago you start dying the moment you're born and that hit me hard. I thought about it for years It's so morbid right but after many years of thinking about it I realized it's not entirely true while aging is inevitable. We're actually Growing we're becoming more full of life as time goes on your body grows your brain develops over time So I truly believe that you're adding more and more life instead of dying from the moment that you're born But yeah at some point your body will start to age your hair will start to gray wrinkles will start showing up on your neck, your face, your hands. It happens to all of us. All of us besides a lot of these Hollywood stars. How do they do it? How is it that some people can be the same exact age and look so different? Well, I'm about to give you 10 things that you're probably doing right now that are aging you faster, making you look older. And in the end of this video, I'll tell you the best hack that I've ever heard of. A hack that Hollywood celebrities used to look 10, sometimes 20 years younger, than they really are. It's something I learned when I lived in Los Angeles and that helped me look like this at 22 and like this at 35. One thing I realized maybe a little too late in life is how damaging the sun is to your skin. This photo says it all. It went viral because as you can see half of this man's face, the left side has severe wrinkles and it sags a lot more than his right side. Can you guess what happened here? This man, his name is Bill McElly-God and you can research He was a truck driver for 28 years and he was exposed to the UV rays from the truck window on the driver's side every single day, the left side. So the left side of his face is more wrinkled, it's saggy and essentially it looks 10 years older than his right side. All right, great. The big ball of fire in the sky is damaging your skin. What do you do? Well, one of the most impactful habits that you can adopt right now to prevent premature aging is applying sunscreen daily. The sun's UV rays are incredibly damaging to your skin, as you can see from that photo. They break down the collagen and the elastin fibers in your skin and when these fibers are damaged your skin actually starts to sag It starts to wrinkle and you can clearly see that on Bill's face Now what does that mean? You have to start wearing sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it every morning as part of your routine. It needs to become a habit. Your skin will look younger that way You'll be safer from skin cancer and even minor sunburns, which can be painful and annoying, right? I know about you, but I hate getting burned. I hate peeling. It's a horrible feeling and it's so bad for your skin But the Sun isn't the only thing beating your skin down when I was in my early 20s I started noticing a pattern. I looked better on the weekdays than on the weekends My skin looked better my eyes looked more awake and even my hair looked healthier Then I finally figured out why that was happening pretty much every weekend I'd go out with my buddies and I would drink we'd go to bars we go to clubs We'd have a few drinks Friday and Saturday night and by Sunday. I looked absolutely wrecked one of the primary ways that alcohol affects Your skin is through dehydration alcohol increases the production of urine So that's why you have to go to the bathroom so much when you drink right it explains a lot of things and that leads to fluid Loss in your body and this dehydration makes your skin dry. It makes it flaky It speeds up the fine lines and the wrinkles and it dries out your scalp too Which explains why my hair was looking so dry and unhealthy and when you drink you also don't sleep as well It disrupts your quality sleep during deep sleep your body goes into a repair mode It produces new cells and repairs damaged cells now when alcohol disrupts that process your skin doesn't get the chance to Regenerate effectively so you end up looking dull tired, right which is exactly what I was noticing I had dark circles my eyes were puffy my whole face was puffy I had dry skin on my scalp dry skin on my beard and face I looked like I aged five years every weekend I swear it was crazy. Now we all know that drinking alcohol isn't good for you, right? We already know that but you have to remember that it's actually really bad for your body. It's actually poison I'm not telling you you need to stop drinking altogether I understand a little drink here and there but you should at least limit the amount of alcohol that you're consuming if you want better skin And if you want that long-term health, which I believe you do now a lot of men drink to party and to have fun and to let loose Some guys drink to take the edge off because maybe there's stressed out about work relationships family issues, and it might be okay to relax you for the night, but it doesn't actually fix the issue. If you're going through a hard time, you need to figure out a real solution. You need to talk to a professional so that you can get to the root of the problem. And BetterHelp offers therapists specialized in the area that you need help with. So whether it's social anxiety, relationship issues, past traumas, or maybe you just want to talk to someone and share what you're going through. And they've sponsored today's video so that I could tell you about it. You should look at therapy like a coaching session. You're learning about yourself, why you act a certain way, why you get mad in certain situations, why you're socially shy or anxious, why you have a hard time asking for help or making friends or communicating with your girlfriend. That's why therapy is so good for you. It gives you a safe space to talk about those things that let's be honest, men don't talk about, men don't share. It's not something that we tend to share even with our closest friends and they make it easy. You sign up online and then they match you with a therapist according to your needs and then you You can schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to go in in person. It's discreet and it's on your schedule. It's the most practical way of talking to a professional and getting real advice about what's going on in your life. Look at it from this perspective and this changes everything. It changed everything for me. Your therapist is another person who's on your side, on your team. They're helping you become a better man. That perspective changes everything. It makes it a lot easier to understand why therapy is good for you. Again, you can always stop it if you don't like it or swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which BetterHelp offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. So check out that first link in my description. It's betterhelp.com slash alexcosta and you even got a discount on your first month. One of the first signs of aging won't even be visible on your face. There's actually an easy way to see if a person is older or younger than you thought. It's a little trick that I use and that you're gonna start using now too. And that's by looking at their hands. your hands are constantly exposed to sunlight, right? Harsh weather and daily washing, which all accelerates that aging process. Now the skin on top of your hands is also thinner and it has a lot less fat compared to other parts of your body, which shows signs of aging faster, like wrinkles, age spots, dryness. Now, when you look at an older person's hands, you'll be able to notice those wrinkles and those sunspots. So when you're in your 20s, in your 30s, et cetera, you have to start taking care of your hands, right? And you really only need to do two simple things. One, sun exposure, of course. Just make sure to keep your hands away from the sun as much as possible. But of course, getting the habit of applying sunscreen to your hands, especially the top of your hands here, or at least SPF 30, and reapply after you wash your hands, of course. And number two, very simple, hydration, moisture. We wash our hands a lot. We use hand sanitizers a lot. It became a big part of our culture. But the alcohol drives out your skin. So make sure to apply a hand moisturizer daily. I actually keep one by my computer desk so I don't forget dry hands. Honestly, they're kind of gross anyway. So this is a good habit to get into. This next habit making you look older is something that most of us do. It's acceptable in our culture, but the truth is we're actually addicted to it. Drinking caffeine to jumpstart our day keeps us going and it gives us that jolt of energy. I drink coffee every single day too, okay? As a matter of fact, I'm having one right now. But one of the primary ways that caffeine impacts your skin is through dehydration. The same way that alcohol does, you go to the bathroom a lot more and you end up dehydrated. I love my coffee, so I found a way to continue to drink it, but without letting it affect my skin. First, you're gonna have to limit yourself. All right, one to two cups of coffee or any other caffeinated drinks per day. So all of those energy drinks, pre-workout mixes, limit yourself to one or two max. And for every cup of coffee or energy drink, you should also drink an extra glass of water to replenish those fluids that you're going to lose because caffeine is a diuretic, right? So it's going to keep you dehydrated. And that's why I also have a bottle of water. Now sleep deprivation is one of the most common and noticeable factors that can make you look older. When you don't get enough sleep, it quickly shows it in your face, right? Dark circles, puffiness, dull skin, you look tired. And these signs of fatigue are not only unattractive, but they can also contribute to prematerially aged appearance. When you're sleeping, your skin actually undergoes a very crucial process of repair, regeneration of cells. So it's kind of bringing it all back to life, right? So when you miss out on quality rest, it basically deprives your skin of the opportunity to heal and to rejuvenate itself. Now you get dark circles and puffiness and these effects are very visible. They're gonna make you look older. They're gonna make you look more tired than you really are. And to combat this, you have to get seven to nine hours of sleep every single night. Everyone's different. I like to get seven myself, But honestly, I should be getting more and I aim to get at least eight when I can. To do that, I always say this, you have to establish, yes, a morning routine, but most importantly, a nighttime routine. I like to play the same songs at night. I like to be in bed by a certain time. I like to have a certain type of tea to calm me down, to make sure that I can sleep and no screens in the last hour of my bedtime. So this is something that you should absolutely do is develop this nighttime routine so that you can sleep earlier and wake up feeling rested and looking good and younger. Now speaking of sleeping, sleeping on your stomach face down can actually cause fluid retention and puffiness as well. Right? And it contributes to the formation of sleep lines that can actually become permanent over time. So the way that you sleep, the position that you sleep in actually changes the way that you look because think about it, you're there for eight hours. Right? So if your body is all, you know, twisted up and you're having your pillow on your face, and you're gonna get all of these wrinkles. It's eight hours a day. If you're doing well, if you're sleeping well, eight hours a day that you're there in that position. So you have to make sure that when you're sleeping, ideally you sleep face up, stomach up, not on your stomach. Another big problem with sleeping on your stomach is the formation of those sleep lines. When your face is pressed against the pillow for hours at a time, the pressure and the friction can actually create those creases and they become permanent on your skin. Specifically, you're going to start noticing those fine lines and wrinkles around the delicate skin on your eyes and around your mouth because it's thinner, it's more delicate, and you're going to see those wrinkles come up pretty quickly if you're sleeping on your stomach. I'm a side sleeper myself and I've been trying really hard to switch it so that I can sleep on my back. It is a process, it takes time, but there is a way to do it and I highly recommend you start as early as possible. Now speaking of sleeping, men are sleeping on this next one. I don't know why men haven't caught on to this yet, but face masks will change your life. For most men's skin tends to produce more oil so it's more oily because of the higher testosterone And what that leads to is clogged pores acne and a generally greasy appearance now a weekly face mask Especially one with like a deep cleansing property like the forte series bamboo charcoal mask that we just launched can effectively remove the excess Oil dirt and it just purifies your skin and it hydrates your skin It's basically like super boosting your skin within 15 to 20 minutes and it's so easy, right? You put it on, it actually feels really nice. It's like a relaxation spa day, self-care day. You do it when you're working, you do it when you're watching a movie, you can do it anytime really, I do it on the plane sometimes. Put it on, you hang out, you can do it with your girlfriends, it's actually a nice couple's activity. And within 20 minutes, your face and your skin will look so much better. And if you use it every week, it's gonna help you reduce appearance of large pores, it's gonna help you reduce acne, it's going to rehydrate your skin. Honestly, it's a game changer, and guys are sleeping on this. Now when it comes to signs of aging, the neck is also overlooked, right? Even though it can be one of the first areas to reveal your true age, it's kind of like your hands, honestly, because the skin on your neck is thinner and it has a lot fewer oil glands than your face. So it makes it more prone to dryness, to sagging in wrinkles. So you can literally see in older people, you can see their necks starting to sag, or starting to get deep, deep wrinkles that honestly will never go away. And one of the easiest ways, The primary way really to prevent aging in the neck area is by just extending your skincare routine beyond your face. So when you're doing your skincare routine when you're washing and moisturizing and exfoliating, instead of just thinking chin up, really think neck up, right? Your neck should be a part of that skincare routine. And quick tip here, when you're doing your skincare on your neck, make sure that you apply upwards motions so that you're not pulling the skin down because that will actually contribute to sagging. Now the skin around your eyes is also very delicate and prone to wrinkles. So using an eye cream is going to help you rehydrate that area. It reduces puffiness and it minimizes fine lines. It keeps you looking younger. I added an eye serum to my skincare routine many, many years ago because I remember vividly talking to this girl about skincare and she's like, you don't have any eye serums, no eye products. And I was like, no, I don't need that. She's like, no, it's prevention. You definitely need it. So that's the reason why we also launched the Africa skincare eye serum, right? It's cooling. helps you deep off your eyes and get rid of those dark circles. And she's so right. Your eyes, that's what people are looking at. So if we have tired eyes, it's going to make you look older. It's going to make you look tired. It's going to make you look even lazy and not awake. That's not the way to go. And I agree with her. Ignoring this area here is going to make you look older than you really are. Right? So incorporate an eye cream or eye serum into your skincare routine, because that's going to help provide that targeted care to the sensitive area. And it's going to help you maintain a youthful appearance for many years to come. When I moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago, I lived right in the middle of Hollywood, literally right in the middle, and I saw actors, musicians, famous celebrities all the time. And they would always be wearing sunglasses. Now, I mean, obviously, I thought they're just doing that to hide, right? It helps them stay undercover and not get noticed by fans, stalkers, or whatever. But one time, I was talking to a model in LA, and I remember it like it was yesterday. She told me that celebrities don't wear sunglasses just to stay hidden. They actually wear them to keep from squinting to keep from frowning because of the bright sun and that's supposed to shave years off of your wrinkles and the lesson here isn't just to wear sunglasses by the way but to relax your face. Let me ask you to do something right now it's really easy and it's gonna feel amazing okay ready? Relax your face. When you're sitting in front of your computer right when you're looking at your phone are you frowning are you doing this right are you doing this on your phone and your computer because I used to do that all the time Are you squinting when you're driving 40 minutes to work and back, right? You're just in the sun doing this that constant movement every time you blink every time you smile every time we squint Frown it leads to the formations of fine lines and wrinkles over time That's why people get boat talks right to freeze the movement so that there's less wrinkles being formed by those movements So remember when you're driving stop squinting when you're on your computer or in your phone stop frowning And that will literally save your face years of wrinkles and fine lines and make sure that you wear sunglasses When you are outside and it's sunny out and look this video is a great start But I know for a fact that you can be more attractive than you think That's why I made this video right here on how easy it is for you to become your most attractive self check it out And I'll see you there"

        "transcript": " Why do so many guys dress like they gave up during the summer? You've probably seen this too. It's the same old boring t-shirt and baggy shorts. It does nothing but show the world that look I have no style Let's face it the typical summer style for most guys honestly sucks And it's weird because it's actually so easy to dress well in the summer It's the easiest season because there's no need to combine a bunch of layers, right? Like in the winter in the colder months, so it's really straightforward So here's a deal I'll make with you right now by the end of this video You're gonna have a much better summer style. You're gonna look so much better than you did last summer because I'll be showing you how to take full advantage of the king of summer fabrics, linen. But first off, let's just break down the common issues with men's summer fashion. Now the biggest problem, in my opinion, is oversimplification. It's making your outfit look bland and boring. What that means is you're choosing to wear a basic t-shirt, pairing it with a simple pair of shorts, which a lot of times they're either too baggy or too long and then you're We're throwing on sneakers, maybe even athletic sneakers, which as you can see makes an outfit as far from stylish as it can be. It lacks imagination, it lacks personality, and also it doesn't look great for a lot of body types. So if you have a little bit of extra weight, it's gonna show and it makes you look top heavy. It's a missed opportunity to show your personal style, especially when there are so many other options available that don't sacrifice style for comfort. Now, that's usually what guys think, right? They think I'm gonna wear a T-shirt and shorts because it's hot. I'm not trying to look good. I just want to be comfortable. That's a cop out. It's bull. Another major mistake is clinging on to the wrong fabrics. Most t-shirts are made from the cheapest, most generic cotton they can find, which typically means heavy, non-breathable fabrics, right? They trap heat and it makes you sweat. This not only makes you uncomfortable, but it also doesn't last. So your cheap t-shirt is only gonna look good for a few weeks before you wash it a couple of times and then it starts to fall apart. And last but not least, and I think this might be the biggest mistake, is the fear of stepping out of your comfort zone. Look, we're guys, we like simplicity, right? I get it. It's easy to fall into this pattern of repeating what everyone else is doing, or just stick into what you've always done because it's safe, right? We like safe. But fashion, even summer fashion, is about expressing your individuality. When everyone defaults to the same basic look, it creates this culture of blending in. When in reality, summer is the perfect time to be bold, to have more fun with your style, and to truly stand out. Now that you know the mistakes, let's pivot to what you should be wearing to look stylish this summer. This is the fun part, by the way. I'm gonna give you a ton of options for your tops, for your bottoms, footwear, and accessories. And real quick, before I do that, I don't know if you noticed this beauty on my wrist, but this is a watch from Aura, and look at that. I wish you could feel how solid this is. It's pretty heavy, it feels really nice on the wrist. Aura makes these modern, but also timeless watches that as you can see, they look, feel, and function like a luxury timepiece, but of course, without the luxury price tag. They sponsor today's video, which is perfect because accessories are a key component to looking good in the summertime. They have different metal options, so you can go with this beautiful brushed polished steel in silver or rose gold, which looks incredible. And they also have them in black if you want something more toned down. The dial options go from brushed steel to a textured dial in different colors and even a skeleton dial, so you can see all of the details of the movement. And if you want to change it up, get a couple of different straps so you can go from a steel bracelet to a rubber strap whenever you want a different style. If you want to wear a sporty outfit, these bands match that aesthetic perfectly. You know I have a lot of watches, you've seen my watch collection and I always get asked for more attainable options that don't cost thousands of dollars. But that look classy, look luxurious and fashionable. If that's you, Aura is a really good option. And of course, I'm not just gonna let you pay full price. Aura is hooking you up with 30% off your entire order with no limits so you can buy one, two, 10 watches and straps and get 30% off if you go to aura.watch.com slash alexkosta. I'm gonna leave that link in the description below. All right, let's get started with upgrading your tops. Every summer you probably hear someone saying, hey, you should wear linen. But I don't think most people know what linen really is and why it's so popular in the hot weather. So technically linen is actually a vegetable. It's made from fibers of flax plant. And that natural fiber is one of the best for handling heat because it's extremely breathable and lightweight. And linen also absorbs moisture really well without holding on to that sweat smell, right? Which is another huge advantage in the hot weather. And unlike other fabrics that stick to you when it's hot and humid, linen actually stays off your skin, which allows air to flow and to keep you cool. So you can see why I always recommend linen as the go-to summer fabric. But how do you integrate it into your wardrobe? My first recommendation is to wear linen button-down shirts. And before you say, oh, I'm gonna be too hot, it's a long sleeve shirt, just hear me out, okay? The graphic tees that you're wearing, they actually trapped more heat than a linen button-down, even though it's a long sleeve. With this shirt, you can unbutton and get more airflow, right? You can roll up the sleeves, right? And I recommend you choose one that isn't tight on you. You want something that is a little bit more loose. And that's because wearing tight clothes in the summer, in general, is a bad idea. You need separation between your skin and the fabric so that you can get that airflow. And there's a ton of brands that make great linen shirts. I'm gonna link all of these below, by the way, but if you look at Club Monaco, they have really nice ones on sale right now, by the way. Reese, Suit Supply, Charles Triwitt, Banana Republic all have great options for linen button downs, so you can find something that's within your budget and that's gonna look good on you. My recommendation for colors, if you're just starting out and if you don't have any, I definitely recommend crisp white shirts because it's versatile, you can wear them to the beach with shorts, or you can literally wear it to a nice dinner with chinos, right? You can't go wrong with white. I'd also get one more color that you know looks good on you. For example, if you sweat a lot, I'd go for a darker color like a navy, a navy blue, so it masks any of those sweat stains. And if you don't sweat, then go for a green or a light blue, summer colors that you can wear a lot. But of course linen button downs aren't the only option this summer. You should also get a couple of camp color shirts. The difference is the open color and it lies flat against the shirt. It doesn't have a color band, so it sits open and loose around your neck. Now I like to wear mine open with a tank top underneath or just buttoned up about three quarters of the way, right? And then you lose a button as it gets warmer. Then wear a necklace to add a cool detail here since it's so visible. Abra Crumbie has good options. You can also check out Jake Crew and my own brand ATOS is having a big summer sale right now, so you can get a couple of these for only $75. Definitely get the blue or the tan. I always get compliments when I wear those, or if you wanna play it safe, you really can't go wrong with black. All right, let's shift gears and let's talk about what's happening below the belt. Don't get any ideas, I'm talking about bottoms, all right? Because your choice of bottoms, it's really crucial, right? It's as crucial as your tops. Summer isn't just about throwing on any pair of shorts, calling it a day, even though most guys honestly tend to do that. And by the way, if you're liking this video so far, do me a favor and hit that subscribe button below and then the thumbs up button. I promise to keep you stylish and help you find your true potential because when you look your best, your life changes. I'm not even exaggerating here. Plus, every like helps me and motivates me to post more free videos here on YouTube for you. Now, when it comes to choosing the right bottoms, you really have two options, shorts or pants, right? That's it. But there are nuances in each of these options. For example, the length, the fabric, the color, the texture, the fit, the number of pockets. So let's start with shorts. Just like your tops, the fabric of your shorts or pants matters a lot. Linen again is a winner here. Of course you can go with other fabrics, but linen shorts are a game changer because they're not only stylish, but they're really comfortable. They have this light, airy feel. They dry quickly and they look great. And I always say shorts shouldn't cover your knees. Your legs will look longer and better if your shorts come down to about two inches above your knees, that's a perfect fit. It shows off your thigh muscles and it keeps you cool. And especially in the summertime, don't go with anything too tight. You wanna feel that air coming in, right? You want it to feel airy, comfortable, not tight and restraining. Now, if shorts aren't your thing, I know a lot of guys don't feel comfortable wearing shorts for whatever reason, or if you're just looking to mix it up, I have two really great options for you. These are my personal favorites. First, linen pants. And I know it sounds weird to be recommending pants for the summertime, but trust me, hear me out, because linen is so breathable and so flexible that it lets air into your pants and it cools you down. Now the secret is to get pants that don't hug your legs because that's when you get warm. See how there's a lot of room here? That helps you stay cool. These are actually from Todd Snyder, they're amazing. Now another great option is Searsucker pants. You see this pattern here? When you see that, it's typically Searsucker, which is a lightweight puckered fabric that's usually made from cotton that has these alternating smooth and crinkled stripes. Now the beauty of Seer Sucker is that this unique texture actually helps the fabric stay off your skin, basically promoting air circulation and making it ideal for more and weather clothing. It's used for summer suiting, it's used for summer shirts, pants, it's breathable, it's durable, and it doesn't wrinkle. So it's a great summer fabric. And personally, I love these Seer Sucker pants because they have that texture, so it makes it stand out. But of course, you're gonna need to match that energy with your footwear. And no, workout sneakers aren't gonna cut it, all right? I recommend three options for summer footwear. First, clean leather sneakers. Now, they don't have to be all white, but it's definitely the most versatile. If you already own that, or if you don't like all white, I like gray, I like tan. You can wear these with pretty much anything. They're so easy to mix and match into all of your outfits. The second option, of course, loafers. They make your outfit look more classy, but they're still really comfortable, and there's a million to choose from, especially right now because they're so trendy. So you can go for something lightweight, like these from Reese, I wear them so much. I really need to get a new pair. They're getting pretty disgusting right about now. These suede loafers from Suit Supply are absolutely beautiful, perfect for a summer night out. And third, sometimes it's just too hot to wear socks. So get some nice slides or sandals. And when I say sandals, by the way, I don't mean these with the Velcro, all right? I mean, nice sandals that can be styled dressy like these from Suit Supply, they're leather or these from Todd Snyder. They look really great and you can actually dress them up. Now you can style them with pants or shorts and they're perfect to lounge by the pool or beach this summertime. But of course, no summer outfit is complete without this next item. It's all in the details, especially when it's too hot outside to wear layers. So bring your look together, make it all work by bringing in some accessories. Summer outfits can look basic, so you have to accessorize. And I recommend you follow what I call the rule of threes, which means that you should wear no more than three pieces of jewelry at the same time. I definitely recommend a watch. Of course, the Oro watches are yours for a 30% off discount with the link below, then you should wear a necklace, something that matches your personality. Personally, I like simple pendants, like these here from Pira. I don't like big necklaces or pendants or complicated necklaces. Simple is the way to go. You can also experiment with rings. I like to do a watch on my left wrist, and then I like to do a ring on my right hand just to balance things out. Lately, I've been really into gold, as you can see, but you can't go wrong with silver. Another must-have accessory for summertime, of course, sunglasses, right? I never leave my place in the daytime without sunglasses for two reasons really. One, they complete the outfit. They add a really nice touch of elegance and even some mystery to your outfit, right? If you go for classic wayfarers, they're gonna look good regardless of what you wear. They're so versatile. And two, I have really sensitive eyes, so in the sun, I can't see shit. So they're super helpful. Check out the description below for links to Aura watches and everything else that I mentioned and stay stylish."

        "transcript": " When I was young, I had no idea how to make my living space at the time my bedroom looked nice. Here's a photo of it as evidence. You can see that I tried. I really did. I wanted it to look nice, but I just had no idea what I was doing, so it looked horrible. Also, at the time, I had no money. I had no funds to make it look good. Fast forward to today, and my bedroom definitely looks a lot better and not just my bedroom, right? I live in this entire apartment and I had to furnish the entire apartment. I had to make sure that it looked nice, add some decor to it. And you know what? Along the way of having that bedroom that you first saw to this apartment that you see today, I've learned that there are a few key pieces that every man needs to make that space look cozy, to make it look modern, to make it look masculine, of course, to make it look good. Here are those key pieces. And something that the majority of men forget, but absolutely changes the entire vibe of your living space is lighting. Now back in the day, I just had a fan with a light on it and I would just pull the string and that was my light. That was it. especially if you live in a modern apartment, we have these top lights that are very bright, very cold, and we don't really like that. It makes a space feel like a hospital, like an airport. So what you have to do is add some soft lighting to your living space, and that completely changes the entire vibe of your apartment. So what you have to do is buy lamps. Now there's a lot of different types of lamps that you could buy. What I recommend is definitely having a table lamp, something with soft lighting. You're looking for something that isn't harsh. Why? At night, when you turn on the light, you don't want it to feel like it's extremely bright. You don't want it to feel uncomfortable. You want to bring that warmth, that coziness to your apartment. So I recommend getting a couple of table lights for your living room. I have one on top of this credenza that I absolutely love. I also recommend a floor lamp. Something bigger, more of a statement piece because they tend to be pretty tall. So they will show up as part of your decor. The two that I like the most here in my apartment are from this brand called Gantry that I literally, I think I just saw on Instagram ad for them. This is not sponsored, I just really like them. So I got the table lamp that's sitting right behind me and then I got the floor lamp that's sitting in my living room and I put it right in front of the pillar so it doesn't cover the view. But you can tell that it's a modern looking lamp. You can see that it's pretty masculine. Not only that, but it also matches the vibe of my apartment. It's black and white, so it fits with everything else here. I also have two bedside lamps, one on each of my nightstands, and they're very soft as well. They look really cool. And actually, I got them from Etsy, believe it or not. Okay, so I've always been a city guy. I've always loved modern things, modern spaces, as you can tell by my apartment. So in my twenties, I actually never owned a single plant. Not one. I thought there were high maintenance and I just didn't like taking care of them. But then I started dating someone at the time and she looked at my apartment and she said, okay, you need some greenery in here. It feels really cold. It feels dead. You need some life. So I said, you know what? That's fine. You're right. This place looks kind of lifeless. You need some greenery, but I'm not ready for plants yet. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy some fake plants. So I bought fake plants. That was my first experience with any kind of greenery in my apartment. And you know what? I had fake plants for a very long time, up until very recently when I got real plants. And one thing's for sure, fake plants do not give off the same vibe as real plants. They don't have the same, obviously life, the same energy. They don't look as good, right? And I'm not an energy kumbaya kind of guy. I've never really cared for plants that much. But after I got my first few, it completely changed the vibe in my apartment. And I actually really like, I think it's very therapeutic. I mean, go and water them once a week and miss them once in a while, take care of them. not only that, they actually look really, really good, way better than any of the fake plants that I've had in the past. Yes, you have to care for them, but they completely change the atmosphere and the environment in your apartment and your living space. I know most guys don't care for it, but I highly recommend that you get some plants, start small with something that you only have to water once every couple of weeks, and it will make your living space so much better and so much warmer. So I've definitely been building out my collection of plants here in the apartment. One of my favorites is this Monsteria. It's an albino Monsteria. At first, I bought it. I didn't really know what it was, but I love the way that it looks. It's been growing a lot. It looks so much different from when I bought it. I have this one here, her name is Jade. It's pretty small, but it's actually been growing a lot too. And it's so easy to take care of and it looks great on top of this credenza. It just adds a pop of life and a pop of color with the pink to my living room, which is very black and white. I have a couple in my office, the newest one being this money tree, which literally is becoming a tree. This thing is growing a little bit out of control right now. It's getting really big. Hopefully it doesn't grow too much bigger, but also hopefully brings a lot of money to my office and my life, but I love how it looks. I think if you're looking for something that is modern looking, very clean looking, the money tree is a great option. And I even have an aloe plant that sits in my YouTube studio and you guys see it in a lot of my YouTube videos. If you don't own any plants yet, what I recommend is you get a snake plant. You literally cannot kill this plant, all right? This you only have to water once a month, if that. This one here that I have in my living room, I've watered twice, I've had it for three months, and it looks amazing. It's growing so fast. It's literally thriving right now. One of the very first pieces of the cord that I got from my living space was a black Tom Ford book. Now you've probably seen this book everywhere. It's a classic. It looks really good. And the reason why I got it is because it's in my favorite color scheme, black and white. So it matches with pretty much everything that I own. And after that, I got hooked. I bought a bunch of different books to fill up the spaces here in my apartment so that no counter is empty and lifeless. And I truly think that if you're a man in your 20s, 30s, or above and you're just now decorating your space. Books can really make it feel homey. It can really fill up a space that's kind of looking empty. So I started with this Tom Ford book. Now I have so many others and I highly recommend you do the same. And the cool thing about books is that they come in every different size, every different colors. So you can get something that really matches your aesthetic, something that matches your living space. Now I've flipped through the books maybe once or twice. I haven't really looked at them, but it's funny how pretty much everyone who comes here and sees the book, the Louis Vuitton book, the Tom Ford book, my fashion book, my car books, they will pick it up and flip through it and we'll have a discussion. So it's also a conversation starter. It's also an ice breaker. If you're bringing a girl over, it's a really nice thing to just have open so they can talk about it. It gives you something to chat about. Now, if you're a guy trying to impress the ladies, there are two items on this list that will definitely accomplish that. The first one was plants. Women just love plants when they come into your place and they see that you're taking care of plants. They love that. Now the second item, candles. And this is something that I got into right after I started buying my books, because they actually, first of all, sit really nicely on top of the books. They make your place smell really nice and they also are great decoration. They look really nice. And when you have somebody over, they come in and they can smell that your place just smells really nice. It gives you that sense of this person is clean. This place is very clean, this living space, he takes care of it, right? So candles accomplish a lot of those things. And I have candles in pretty much every single room in my apartment. I don't light them up all the time, but they look really nice. If I want to have a chill night in the bedroom, watch something on Netflix, I can light up a candle, let it smell really nicely, and then I come in, and it's almost like a spa. You have that really cozy feeling, so highly recommend you get some candles for your living space. And for a while there, I actually got into it pretty deep, and I researched all different types of candles. You can literally buy candles for $2, you can buy candles for $300. It's crazy, right? So you can choose something that's within your budget, something that looks great, and is a part of your aesthetic, and of course something that smells really, really good. Pro tip, I got this rechargeable candle lighter from Amazon that every time someone comes over, they use it, or they see me using it, they love it. I'll also link it down below, but it's super, super affordable. One of the biggest mistakes that I see guys making all the time is having a ton of empty walls, and that makes the place look cold. It makes you look like a hospital. So one of my latest obsessions has been with different types of artwork, and I think if you caught my New York art mentor, then you saw the different types of artwork that I have here. This one I got from a friend of mine, the suited racer. He's an artist here in New York City. I got this one here from LA. I brought it from Los Angeles. And I got these in Miami at Art Basel, which just look completely different from anything else in my apartment. Why? Because I wanted it to show some personality. I wanted it to look different. And I wanted it to feel special. Also, one of the best things about artwork is you can tell a lot about the person who lives in that place by the kind of art they decide to hang up. So if you like cartoons, maybe hang something up that's very colorful. It's got some anime cartoons in it. Or if you like cars, you can get really sick cars, right? Beautiful photos of sports cars or vintage cars or anything that you're into. One thing you should keep in mind is to not go overboard. When I was a kid, I used to hang up all of these posters. And I think a lot of kids go through that phase of hanging out posters in their bedrooms. And it's fine when you're a teenager, but when you're an adult, it's time to let those go. And it's time to upgrade and get something that actually elevates your place instead of making it look like you live in a dorm room. And even within my apartment, I have different styles of artwork. So this one is a little bit more cartoonish. I have that one that's a little bit more trippy. I have very abstract black and white. I have something that was from my tattoo artist. So you can really play around and just have fun with it. Create a space that is your own. And of course, if you wanna see every single room in my apartment, I just posted a full New York City apartment tour on YouTube and I'll link that below."

        "transcript": " Recently, there's been a lot of creators quitting YouTube for good. Big creators like MatPat, whose channel I used to manage at Google when I worked there. Tom Scott, Captain Sparkles, Jordy, and so many others are hanging up their cameras. They're done posting on YouTube. And seeing so many creators I worked with and have known for years, retired from YouTube, it made me stop and reflect on whether I should do the same. And I'll be honest, I came really close to doing that last year. I mean, it's been 13 years since my first upload on YouTube. You know, when I started making YouTube videos and posting them on YouTube, I had no idea what I was getting into. And you have to realize this was way before being internet famous was cool, right? I was just posting videos on YouTube to promote a website that I had launched. The website cost me $200 to make. A friend of mine helped design it. It was a gaming website that let you connect with other gamers in Brazil, where I'm from. but I had no money to advertise this website. Just to paint the picture here, at the time I was delivering landscaping material during the day, literally driving a truck with mulch, sand, stones, whatever, then dumping it into our customer's yards. This is a video of the actual place where I work. And at night I was studying to become an EMT and working as a bouncer at a club on the weekends. So gaming, that was just a hobby. You know, I just wanted to make some extra money, but here's where my life completely changed. I started posting these videos on YouTube, promoting those gaming tournaments in my website. And over time, after months and months of doing that, I realized that I didn't really care about the website or gaming anymore. I got tired of that world very quickly. But every day between jobs, between studying, I would look forward to coming home and creating and posting a new video for my, at the time, very, very small audience. I fell in love with creating, with sitting down at my desk with nothing, an empty screen, and then creating the best piece of content that I could come up with. I fell in love with editing and getting better and faster at it. I'm not gonna lie, I pirated an editing software called Sony Vegas. It was a complete piece of sh**, and you would crash all the time because it wasn't a legit version, but I loved it. I'd pull all nighters editing videos to post in the morning before I went to work. And mind you, and this is a big one, all of that for free. I wasn't getting enough views to get a single dollar from YouTube for a very long time. So I was doing it because I enjoyed it. And because I knew there was something there. I could visualize a blurry future in which my YouTube channel and all of this would pay off somehow. But again, this is way before influencer was even a word. This was way before YouTuber, being a YouTuber was even a thing. Because of this, I found my life purpose. I'm here to help men unlock their full potential, to help you see what you're capable of, to show you how to look your best so you can have the confidence to tackle any opportunity that comes your way. And I'm honestly addicted to that feeling. I can't see a world in which I'm not helping men elevate themselves to that new level. And by the way, finding your purpose, understanding who you want to be as a man, that changes everything. It gives you a special type of energy, of discipline. If you have no life purpose, no big goals, then life gets boring, right? And the reason why I've been able to do this for such a long time and stay consistent is because I found my purpose, but it wasn't easy. I had a lot of twists and turns to finally find my way. And then I was able to laser focus on this because of that purpose, because I knew what my purpose was. So more than anyone, I can relate to guys who haven't found their purpose yet, but I'm telling you, life is just different when you find it. It's more exciting. It gives you a special type of energy when you wake up. You want to get things done. It's like a superpower. And the best way to find your purpose is to learn more about who you are, what you're good at, what you need help with, what you like, what you don't like. And the same way that I recommend you all to find a mentor that can help you push your career to that next level. I also recommend you be proactive and find a good therapist. And our sponsor, BetterHelp makes that so easy. You just click that first link below, get connected with a therapist, someone who can help you unpack all of your thoughts, give you direction. Too many guys just go wherever the wind takes them with no clear direction. You need to know where you want to end up. Visualize it. Understand it. Because otherwise you're just not going to magically get there. It's just not going to happen. And you can sign up to BetterHelp Online. Schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat or even messaging if you just want to start with that. It's on your schedule. It's the most practical way of talking to a professional who can give you guidance, right? Can give you insights that you can only get from someone who understands human psychology. And I'll tell you what's going to happen. This is exactly what's going to happen after your first few sessions. You're going to be looking forward to the next ones because with every session you learn so much about yourself. And if you're a curious person like I am, I like to ask questions and just learn more about anything. Well, learning about yourself 20 or 30 years into your life is a wild, wild journey. And you can always stop if you don't like it. You can swap to a different therapist if you don't like yours, which better help offers free of charge if you're not happy for whatever reason. So be open-minded, click that first link in the description below. It's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta and you're even gonna get a discount on your first month. I knew there was something there, but I had truly no idea what it was gonna turn into. I just knew that there was something special about creating this YouTube channel. And I remember to this day when my channel got picked up by this company called Machinima, if you're an OG on YouTube, then you know the name. But that meant that I'd finally start getting paid. And I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. I cried, man. I was reading this email from Machinima and tears were just rolling down my cheeks. You know, I thought, this is special. There's something going on here and I'm gonna see it through. 30 days later, I got my first paycheck, came in the mail and it was less than $200. But I held that check up and I literally showed it to everyone. It was like I won the lottery. You know, it was like, this is, see, you didn't believe in me. Look at this, now I made $200. It wasn't even $200. It was like $180. And by this time, I was already an EMT, so anytime I didn't have a patient, I would be editing my videos in the back of an ambulance, hoping that I wouldn't get caught and fired. And look, a lot has happened since those days. I moved to Los Angeles to pursue this dream of producing online content. I got a job at Google, helping them grow their gaming initiatives within YouTube. And you can kind of see how the gaming website and my gaming content helped me secure that job. I changed my YouTube channel countless times from gaming to vlogging to fashion to now all-encompassing men's lifestyle. And I started my own men's grooming products, Forte Series, a brand that I absolutely love. It's my baby. And here we are on YouTube with four million subscribers. I haven't stopped posting since those early days, posting those gaming videos. I actually have not taken a break. I'm the kind of guy who, I just stepped on the gas 24-7. The people around me, they actually call me a robot because I don't stop, I don't rest, I just move on to the next thing on my list. I'm not even exaggerating, I can't remember what it's like being bored. I don't remember what that feels like. And maybe you ask yourself, why would YouTubers quit their channels when they have millions of subscribers? Because nowadays, being a full-time creator or influencer, which by the way, we need a better word, a better name for this job, because no influencer likes to be called an influencer. It's a weird word, but it's a dream job, right? When you ask teenagers what they want to be the majority, they're gonna say, I want to have a large following on social media and I want to live off of that. But what you need to realize is that a dream job, something that you love doing, is still a job. Look, I quit Google in 2018 to become a full-time content creator. I was making six figures at Google. It was a very comfortable job. I was doing well for myself for the first time ever. And I quit to do this full-time. And I was so excited to quit my nine to five and make my own schedule. And it's funny because nowadays I literally work from six a.m. to seven p.m. and I don't really have weekends. And by the way, just for my content, I have a team of seven people. Just to make this happen, so it's not like, it's just me doing this and that's why I work so much. There's a team and I still work even way more than I did before. So my days split between creating content, managing the team, developing products and marketing for my brand's Forte ATOS Africa Switch, We have a lot more employees for that as well. Working on the men's image lab community, talking to brands and partners who I work with on my social media. There's legal, there's PR, there's accounting. There's a lot more that I'm not going to bore you with, but all of that to say, I'm not a YouTuber anymore. I own and I operate a media company and three brands. And that, my friend, that's a job. And these big YouTubers, they do the same, maybe even way more than I do. Maybe they have a much bigger team, right? a lot bigger production. So I completely understand why these guys are quitting. This is the kind of job that you can't really take a break. If you stop posting consistently, your channel literally gets less and less views and it's almost impossible to revive it. I've seen it happen many times working at Google and with friends as well who are YouTubers. And that pressure, that amount of discipline, the creative and the output consistency, it takes a toll on you and I'm not gonna lie, I've felt that burnout on and off for years now. You can watch my journey right here. It's all documented on this channel and on my old channel, my first channel. I had a channel before this one. So I've been doing this consistently for a long time and I've had my moments where stepping away seemed like the only option. Just last year I hit a wall and I thought, maybe I'll just quit everything else and just work on Forte, the brand is doing really well. I don't need to be killing myself to do this, but the weird part is that I just can't see myself not posting on YouTube. Last year when I was thinking about retiring, I had to really think about that word, purpose. I remember I had this really long flight from Dubai to New York, and in flights, if I can, if I don't have a ton of work, that's urgent, I like to give myself one to two hours on these long flights to just think and just brain dump, because something that's happened to me is I don't have time to think. It's really weird and I'm not complaining, I love what I do, but I literally don't have time to think. There's always something pulling me into different directions. So on flights, I'm like, this is the perfect time. And so I went deep into the meaning of the word purpose and what it meant to be. And it revived me. It brought me back to life. It gave me new energy and with that energy, I built my new community, Men's Image Lab. I worked harder than I've ever worked in the beginning of this year. And that's because I know that I'm fulfilling my purpose and that flight really brought it all back to me. You know, and just to make it clear, helping men unlock their full potential and live a better life is my purpose. But that doesn't mean that it's the only one. I have a purpose as a son. I want to keep my parents happy. I want to keep them comfortable. I want to make them proud. I have a purpose as an older brother to show my younger brothers the way of life to help them out, right? And then there's so many others. When you start thinking of all of that, there's just no way that you don't get energized, that you don't just get this burst of energy and excited about life. So I'm not slowing down. As a matter of fact, and hopefully you noticed, but the channel is going through a rebrand sorta. You know, I hired better editors. I built a new studio here in New York. We're making better thumbnails. I'm posting longer videos. My Instagram reels and TikToks, they're sharp. They're as sharp as ever. They're looking better than ever. and we're launching, we're literally launching 10 new products for Forte series over the next year. It's definitely a little bit of a transitional moment in my business, you know, I'm hiring new people, training them to bring this vision to life, and I would love to continue to do this for a long time. So I just wanna say thank you. Thank you for believing in me, in my brands. Thank you for every like and comment. I know it sounds lame, right? It sounds kind of corny, but that shit helps me fulfill my purpose, and it helps other men find their purpose. I'm not hanging out my camera just yet. I have a lot more to say, have a lot more to show you. But if you have suggestions for new content, don't be shy, hit me up in the comments. I'm gonna be reading them. I wanna continue to evolve as a creator, as an entrepreneur, and I'm glad that you're still here, especially if you made it to the end of the video. I'll see you again in the next one."

        "transcript": " If you're not a teenager anymore, then it's time to stop dressing like one. The majority of guys think that to be casual or comfortable, they need to sacrifice style. But let me tell you right now that you don't. There's a way to look stylish even on your lazy days. I call it the three C's of style, which means you can have an outfit that's casual, comfortable and classy all at the same time. And you know what's funny is that most guys wear a t-shirt, some tight jeans and running sneakers, and think that that's fine. And it's literally the worst outfit that you could ever wear. If I see a guy wearing that, I know for a fact he's not stylish because one, it doesn't look good, right? He looks like every other guy at the mall and two, it's not even comfortable. Jeans aren't that comfortable, especially tight ones and those t-shirts with the designer logos on the chest, they're horrible. And by the way, I know that because I used to be that guy. I used to wear that in my early 20s before I knew anything about dressing well. So this comes from personal experience. So how do we fix that? It's very easy, actually. I'm gonna show you how to make five simple changes to your casual outfits to make them look stylish without sacrificing comfort, which is important to us, right? Now, if you follow fashion trends, you know that baggy clothing is trendy, but for this video, I don't want to talk about trends. I want to teach you timeless style. And honestly, more and more, I'm just sick of these fads, these trends that brands establish and promote just to get to change up your entire wardrobe and buy new clothes every single year. You have so many better options. Instead of an extra baggy t-shirt, you can wear a relaxed t-shirt that will look so much better on you. I like these from Uniqlo, for example. They do have a boxier fit. They're modern, right? But they don't go overboard. They look great. And if you want a tapered fit that hugs your body, then the ATOS t-shirts are the best for that. Just make sure to size up if you want a roomy fit. So if you're small, get a medium. Here's the problem with t-shirts, though. They don't hit all three Cs. They're casual, they're comfortable, but you can't say they're classy, right? They're basic T's. So the biggest trap that most men fall into is thinking that a T-shirt is the only option when it comes to dressing casual. And nowadays guys think that polos aren't casual which is funny because that's literally what they were designed for. A polo is a T-shirt with a color. The comfort level is basically the same but polos look a lot more classy. And brands like King and Tuckfield, Suit Supply, Reece and ATOS have casual polos that you can wear with shorts, with sneakers and they'll look a lot better than a basic T-shirt. This one here for For example, it's from Reese, I just picked it up and I'll make sure to link it below. Look, I still like my t-shirts. More and more though, I find myself gravitating towards polos for casual everyday looks because I'm a grown man. Another amazing option and men are finally catching on to this is wearing linen shirts. Linen is a very lightweight and breathable fabric. You can feel the difference. It's a lot thinner and it's like slightly see-through. It gives it a nice flowy, relaxed feel which is perfect for looking classy and comfortable on a hot spring and summer day. But unlike a t-shirt, you can undo a couple of buttons, right? You can get some airflow, and you still get all three seasons. By the way, I'll type up a big list of my personal recommendations for all of these items in the description of this video to make it easy for you to upgrade your style once and for all. Now, if it's a cooler day or night, then instead of wearing a sporty sweatshirt that looks like you're just going to the gym, wear a wool sweater. Specifically, I like the thinner merino wool sweaters because they're not these bulky, heavy sweaters. It's more streamlined. It keeps you warm and it looks great. And by the way, they're extremely soft. So you're comfortable without sacrificing style. But of course, sometimes you're gonna need a jacket. And this is where it gets even more fun because there are just so many options. Let me run you through some of my favorites. For example, check out this lightweight bomber jacket from Theory. You can tell it's a great quality bomber. It looks sharp and it fits really well. It's a great casual option that can still make you look elevated and cool. And we make one from ATOS that has a few more features like the backpack straps. Perfect for guys who commute, take the subway or the metro if you're in London. and you walk in there and it's super hot, right? Filled with people, you don't wanna carry it, so you just wear it like a backpack, problem solved. But as much as I love my bummer jackets, they only cover two out of the three C's. They're casual, they're comfortable, but they're stylish, but they're not really classy. If you want something classy, let me give you another option. Now at first you might think that sports jackets are way too formal, but it's all about the details. Sports jackets, they're not suit jackets, they're different. Look at this outfit, for example. He's wearing a sports jacket. It's not a formal stuffy outfit. Wearing a t-shirt underneath or even a tank top, if you're a guy who likes to be noticed, right? I see a lot of that here in New York City nowadays. It's an awesome look. It looks really sharp. Swap the leather formal shoes for leather sneakers and all of a sudden you have yourself a nice casual look that hits all three C's. The sneakers and the t-shirt or the tank top, they dress it down. Making a casual, comfortable and of course classy. But I get that that's not for everyone. And if you're still not feeling this force jacket, I do have another option for you that's my go-to, especially right now in the spring. If you follow my Instagram, then you know that I've been wearing a lot of cardigans lately. And that's because you can easily dress them up or down. They're very versatile. Depending on the vibe that you're going for, it's just literally about swapping the accessories and what goes underneath. I like the cardigan and white tank top combo, for example, for a daytime look. And this brown cardigan from Mango, white ATOS tank top, 10 trousers from Reese, and white sneakers. This outfit hits all three Cs and it looks great. And you can easily do the same to dress it up a little bit more for a nighttime look with a black cardigan, a black tank top, black trousers and loafers. Now I've literally worn this exact outfit to a nice dinner and got a ton of compliments, even though it's a pretty easy outfit to pull off. Now the difference here is that instead of wearing a hoodie or a sweatshirt, these layers, they add maturity and don't sacrifice comfort into your outfit. Right. And that's what dressing casually as a grown man is all about. It's finding these replacements that when you don't know much about fashion, they feel like it's too much, too stuffy, right? A cardigan that doesn't, it feels stuffy. Maybe you're scared that people will think that you're trying too hard. But in reality, f*** those people. I'm serious. F*** those people. Look guys, I'm 35. I've been studying fashion and men's self-image for a while and the moment you decide to not wear nice clothes because of what people might think of you, you need to do two things. One, take a good look in the mirror and ask yourself who you want to be. And two, you need to reevaluate the people around you because if they judge you for stepping up your looks, they're bringing you down for trying to elevate yourself. And that's no friend. That's just a jealous individual who doesn't want what's best for you. And this is the exact reason why we have a free community called Men's Image Lab, where we have a group of guys who are actually cool and who actually want to look out for each other, men who want you to look good and to succeed. So when you ask them questions about an outfit, a fragrance, or fitness, you get good answers that are trying to elevate you instead of some fake friends who are jealous of your growth. I'll link the community below. A lot of guys seem to think that they don't have many options when it comes to casual pants. They either go for baggy jeans or worse, they default to sweatpants 24 seven. And hey, I love sweatpants. All right. I love sweatpants as much as you do. But if we're talking about elevating your casual look, they're obviously just not going to cut it. The truth is, You can easily keep things casual and comfortable while still looking classy. For example, nice trousers. Seriously, swapping from jeans to nice trousers will change your life. They're way more comfortable than jeans. Literally way more comfortable than jeans, but instantly they make you look more polished. And they don't even compare to sweatpants, right? Sweatpants have two purposes. In my opinion, it's lounging at home where flight's longer than six hours. Besides that, I don't even suggest wearing sweatpants for anything else. Not even the gym. I'm not, personally I'm not a fan. The fabric is too warm, my legs get all sweaty, so I prefer to wear shorts, or sometimes I'll do nylon pants like these ATOS Cargos that are a lot thinner and more breathable, way better. And if you're looking for specific recommendations, I really like these traveler pants from Reese. They hit all three C's. I also really like these here from Theory, and I even like linen pants like these here from Todd Snyder. Honestly, I think guys are sleepy on linen pants. Seriously, they're way more comfortable than sweat pants, way more comfortable. They're a lot lighter, and they look a lot more polished so you can create stylish outfits like this. Plus, like I said, linen is a very breathable, lightweight fabric, perfect for summertime, way better than sweatpants. And look, sure, you can wear jeans, you can make it look good, right? It just depends on how you style it. If you wear jeans with a tank top, an open shirt, right, nice accessories, and clean sneakers, you're gonna look great. Just make sure that the jeans fit you well. I don't recommend going too baggy, it makes you look sloppy, and it looks like you're trying to fit into the Gen Z trends, and as a grown man, you know, I would stay away from that. Go for a tapered or straight cut. Those are the two best fits for a timeless style. I like jeans from KOS, I like jeans from Suitsupply, they're really killing it right now. Reese Frame makes really good jeans, I'll link a bunch below. And when you get them, make sure to get them hemmed so they fit you properly. That means, by the way, to tailor them, if they're too long, they're not stacking up in your shoes because that's not gonna look good. And by the way, some of these stores like Nordstrom, for example, I know they offer free hem if you buy in store. So always ask if they offer that if you're shopping in person. Otherwise, just take it to a tailor. It's not gonna cost you more than 20 bucks to make it fit your body perfectly. And again, you want that fit to be perfect. Also, big no-no, no distressed denim. All right, no blown out knees. Remember, well, those were trendy. I know because I used to buy a bunch of those and I look at pictures now and I cringe, right? No bleached designs, no embroidery or glitter or whatever. Keep it classy. Now onto one of my favorite parts of any outfit. This can bring it all together and make you look amazing or it can completely derail and kill your look. Let's talk about footwear. We've been through the worst outfit in men's fashion history. Jeans with a T with running sneakers. Specifically tight jeans, even worse. You know that saying, putting your best foot forward. Well, this is putting your worst foot forward, literally, physically, so let's fix that. And finding classier sneakers, it's actually a lot easier than you might think. Take these sneakers from Arnie, for example, they're comfortable and instantly make any outfit look more intentional and more put together. And when you style them with nice trousers, you're gonna nail that look without even trying. This is easy, all right? It looks good and it kills me to see guys wearing workout kicks out in the streets for no reason. Look, if you like a slim shoe, there's also a bunch of options. Check out Common Projects, for example. They're a little pricier, yes, but they look very sharp. By the way, they sell like crazy. They're very, very popular because they're classy. Personally, I prefer the Arnie's just because they're a little bit chunkier, but they don't go overbought. They're not like chunky sneakers. They're just slightly thicker than the Common Projects. The Common Projects, for me, they're a little too slim. And let me unpack that a little bit. For Common Projects, they're a little bit too slim because back in the day, I used to wear them when I wore skinny or slim pants. So it was a streamlined look. But if you're wearing the straight look or the tapered look, it's not gonna go well. literally those pants are gonna eat up the shoe and it's gonna disappear into the pants. But if I'm being honest, and this is a surprise to me, even honestly, because I never thought I'd be wearing this, my go-to lately, it's been loafers. They're almost as comfortable as a leather sneaker, but way classier. But you throw these on with trousers and a polo and you have yourself a really nice casual outfit that hits all of the three C's and honestly will make you look like a boss. It's the type of outfit that you can wear to a casual Friday at the office, right? Or you can go get groceries in this and the ladies will look at you. There's just no way they're gonna miss it because you're gonna be a stylish dude and it looks like it's intentional. And that's what I mean. Why leave your house looking all homeless and not stylish at all? And you know, don't blame it on comfort because this outfit is comfortable. I wear this type of outfit all the time and it's way more stylish than sweatpants and a T-shirt and some running sneakers. The difference is night and day. There's no comparison. So stop being lazy. Put on a nice outfit before you show yourself to the world because who knows, maybe you're gonna run into the woman of your dreams today. Maybe you're gonna make a great business connection. And guess what? Wearing these nicer outfits will only benefit you and enhance your life. But if you want to be stylish, there's one final change that you have to make to your outfits. And it's the way that you accessorize your outfit. Right now we're going into spring, we're going into summer, which means your outfits would be a little bit more simple. And that's only because there's less layers for you to play with. So how do you complete an outfit during summertime? Well, it's with accessories. right now I'm wearing a watch and I'm wearing a ring. And that's great. You don't need to go overboard. So many guys put a ton of bracelets on and then they have a whoop and then they have a Fitbit and then they have an order ring and then they have their actual watch. I'm like, what are you doing, man? It's way too much. You're going overboard. There's no need. So before you go accessory crazy, let me introduce you to the rule of three which makes it so much easier for you. Basically, you should never wear more than three accessories at a time, specifically jewelry or things, it just starts to look a little tacky. So if I was wearing an open shirt right now, I could have a necklace, right with a pendant, something small, something classy, a watch, and a ring. That's the rule of three. It's perfect. It's not going overboard and it's not simple. You can also wear sunglasses, right? Spring is here. Make sure to wear sunglasses, keep your eyes safe and also accessorize your look. Some guys tend to just default to wearing a hat, for example, when it's sunny. And look, hats are fine. It's cool once in a while, especially if you're going out with your friends, like to a baseball game or something like that. but having a classy hairstyle really is the way to go. It's just gonna make you look so much better. And of course, Forte Series has all of the hair products that you need to make sure that your hair looks classy and great, I'm actually testing out a new product today that's top secret, but I'll be revealing it very soon. This is our, I wanna say this is our coolest product ever, but I can't choose a favorite son or a favorite kid, but this might be the one. So look, to dominate your casual style, you gotta find the right fitting tops with the perfect jacket, some clean chinos, a tailored dark jeans, pair with classy sneakers, wear the polos, make sure that you're not wearing something lazy, make sure that you're presenting yourself to the world well. And by the way, if you're ready for your new hairstyle, and you probably are, some guys take too long to change your hairstyles, this video right here has all the recommendations for each age group, so you know exactly what hairstyle you should get, no matter your age."

        "transcript": " Welcome to my New York City apartment tour. This is my dream apartment. I've been here for almost two years now and as you know, I moved from LA to this apartment. It was really tough to find an apartment in New York that just offered everything that I needed. But once I looked at this, I knew that this was the perfect spot for me. Right, I have my office here, I have my YouTube studio and I have a lot of things that I wanna show you guys. And I have an absurd amount of amenities, like a legit tree house, a sauna, billiards room, a really nice lounge, golf simulator, a full-size basketball court, and a bunch of others. So I'm gonna show you around. This is the living room. This honestly, you know, just a dream living room. We have incredible views of the New York City skyline. You can see the sunset right now, sun is going down. You can see the Brooklyn Bridge back here. All the busyness, all of the motivation, inspiration that you get from New York City, right from the living room. Maybe my favorite upgrade to this living room was this credenza here. It just fills the space so nicely. I love the marble and the walnut right here. It just brings it all together. I also needed some warmth. You know, my things are very black, white, and stone marble. It was feeling a little cold and I really think that this did it. I added this lamp right here, which I think looks really cool. I like ambient lighting like this. This is a Samsung frame TV. You know, I like having different pictures in here, changing it up once in a while. I have some really interesting books. I've become a plant dad lately. I've been taking care of plants recently. This couch, I absolutely love this couch. This is a modular couch. It's not very comfortable, not gonna lie. It is really low and I needed something low here because I didn't want anything blocking the actual view of the apartment. This is a CB2 mirror that I had in LA and I brought it with me. You know, as someone who is showing his outfits a lot on Instagram, this is the perfect mirror to just capture your entire outfit from head to toe. So if you guys see some pictures of my Instagram story or Instagram, this is it. This is the mirror selfie spot right here. Something I forgot to show you is my new baby, my John Mayer Martin guitar. This is the 20th anniversary edition. It's a limited edition. And when John Mayer announced it, I knew I had to have it. I'm a huge John Mayer fan. Absolutely love his music. I also recently picked up this chair. It's very comfortable. It's cozy. This is something that I brought from LA. And I love it. I love the chrome. I love how clean it is. I think it's from CB2 or Crate & Barrow as well. Also brought this from LA. It doesn't really work. It's really hilarious. how bad this thing is. It looks cool. It looks really good. It goes really well with the aesthetic of the apartment. I always face it this way because I feel like if I face it towards the building, it would be super creepy. So I'm always like, make sure that it faces that way. And people don't think you're, you know, peepee on them. This is another lamp that I bought recently. I really liked the way that it looks ambient lighting. It looks really nice. And I put it here so it doesn't block the view as well. This is my newest plant. This is something that I was really excited to pick up. Yeah, I love the albino features of this plant. I just got it recently so I've been like keeping an eye on it and making sure that it does okay. The couch was a lot longer when I got it and it was just a little too long for the living room. So because it's a modular couch, I took the middle part out and I just placed it over here. In this little nook here, I have my bar cart. I'm gonna be honest, I'm not too much of a drinker whenever people come over. I like to make drinks but lately I really haven't been drinking that much. And that's because I wear, honestly, I started to wear my whoop, this fitness tracker that I wear around my bicep that you guys are always asking about. It really tells me that my recovery is horrible after I drink and that had a big impact on me And I started drinking a lot a lot less over here is a frame of a photo of Rio de Janeiro I'm not from Rio, but I am from Brazil and every time I look at this I'm just reminded of Brazil reminded of my family who still lives out there and who I go to visit Once or twice a year over here. We have this countertop where I have dinner meals. I don't have a dining room table here I don't have a dining table. It's just it was by choice. I don't think that the space really allows for it in this apartment This is the little kitchen. I am If you've been following me for a while, you know, I'm not a cook. I can't cook you don't want to eat my food So what I do is I actually order prepped meals and I just put them in the fridge and I eat them as I go I also order out once in a while or go and have dinner with friends So I really don't use this kitchen my assistant Megan also cooks once in a while should cook lunch for herself, lunch for me. One of the best things about this apartment is this right here. This is a coffee maker and I love this coffee maker so much. It's something that I really never thought I'd have. I make my coffee here every afternoon. I have my, usually my pre-workout in the morning, coffee in the afternoon and that keeps me going. If you want to add milk, you can. It just makes all sorts of coffee drinks, which I'm a big coffee guy right now. So I do have a wine cooler here too. Like I said, I don't drink a lot at home, but when people come over, it's always nice to have some wine, especially if you have a wine cooler. So it just made sense to kind of stock it up and have some wine here waiting for my guests. So I keep a few bottles here. People come over, we have a glass of wine, maybe a bottle of wine, chat, have a good time. Let me show you my fridge. It's looking a little sad right now. So don't judge me. I feel like this is really personal right now. I'm gonna get judged but it's it's kind of empty. There's like nothing in there. It's literally drinks, pre-workout, prime, you know protein bars, hot sauce, eggs. It's looking really plain right now but it doesn't usually look like this. It looks a little better but not much better. Not much better. This is it's just missing my meals to be honest with you which which got delivered today and I didn't pick it up. Moving on to where I spend the majority of my time, this is my office. As you walk in, you see my million subscriber gold play button from YouTube. So this is the office. I just added all of this decor recently. It actually feels really nice in here. It used to be not really that comfortable to work here every single day. And my videographer, Rodrigo, who's shooting this video right now and will be editing as well, is he usually sits right here. So it comes in, this is really just a nice relaxing workspace for us. We're putting out a lot of content. So I needed the space to be really conducive to being creative and there's nothing more conducive to creativity than this view right here. I mean, this is, in my opinion, just the best view in the entire apartment because it's just water. I look outside, I see just so many cars, so many people, so much movement, helicopters, the Brooklyn Bridge, FI-Die, it just, to me, it's so inspiring to see all of the movement in New York City. Every time you look outside, there's something to look at. I could sit here and look outside for, honestly, hours because there's always something changing. It's something that just never gets old. I'm so, so grateful for this view and for this apartment. And to be able to work here every single day and look outside, it's very inspiring to me. This is the battle station. You know, we got a big ass monitor just because I like to have a bunch of tabs. I am multitasking a lot. I have a lot of things going on. So for me, it was important to have, you know, a pretty big monitor, a really nice workstation so I can keep track of all of my things. I've got a Herman Miller chair. It's very comfortable. You know, I have this Journey mousepad, which I think is super cool because it charges my phone, it charges my AirPods. I have my speakers, my Google assistant, my computer deck, and of course my AirPods Maxes as well, which I use once in a while. And the newest addition to the office here, something that excites me every day, I come in here and I turn them on is the neon signs, the Forte Series Neon Sign, my men's grooming line, and then ATOS, my clothing brand. It just looks so cool. I come in here and it just reminds me of the brand and it makes me want to work to make them bigger, to make them better every single day and develop new products that are exciting for me and for you guys watching this video. In these baskets, I keep all of my equipment. So there's a lot of camera equipment. There's a lot of cables, all the things that you need. I also keep this really cool as the fashion influencer, not men's fashion, fashion, overall fashion influencer of the year, of 2021 from the American Influencer Awards. This is the OG 100,000 subscriber silver play button that I got many, many years ago and my YouTube channel was still called Made in Brazil. Recently, I also got this whiteboard, which is super cool, right a ton of stuff in there. Might be my favorite part of the office. This is a love sack and it's just the most comfortable seat in the house. There's nothing more comfortable than this. It's incredible and you got this view in front of you. It's just, this is it right here guys. This is living the dream right here. I'm gonna show you something special. All right, this is a bathroom. But it's a bathroom that I don't use because as you can see it's a storage bathroom, but I also need a lot of space. I get a lot of things and I get a lot of product development samples, for example, for my brands, just the space that I need to put my things in here. And of course, this is an office for us to work in. So nobody takes a shower here, which then means that if nobody's taking a shower here, it doesn't get humid in here. And if it doesn't get humid in here, it allows me to have my fragrance collection in here. This is my fragrance collection and I always love opening this up before I go out and I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I spend five minutes here just pondering, what do I wanna smell like today? What do I wanna feel like? You know, what's the right fragrance for the right vibe? And I'm definitely overthinking it, but it's kind of fun at the same time. Don't worry, like I said, no one takes a shower here. So these fragrances are safe. All right, follow me into the YouTube studio. This is where I shoot all of my YouTube videos that you guys see. And before we get there, I just wanna show you this here real quick because this is something that's really cool to me. I went to Miami Art Basel for the first time a few months ago in December and absolutely fell in love with these pieces and just the way they move. And what I like about them is that they look so different from anything else that I have here. I needed something that stood out in this hallway and I thought that was the perfect time to invest into some art. Now, as you walk by them, you come over here And this is the YouTube studio. We just redid this YouTube studio. So if you go back even three months ago, two months ago to the YouTube channel, this looked completely different. So I decided to change the wallpaper. Let's add some acoustic wooden panels here. So there's felt. So there's it limits the echo in here. But as you can hear, it's still a little bit echo-y in here. This is my favorite desk. And it's funny because I don't really use it. It's got this just waterfall effect. And I just love the way that it looks, especially with this chair. One really cool thing is this painting here, and if you have been following me for a while, you know that this is actually a painting of me. And I love it because I'm not in it. So it's not like I have a painting of my face here and it looks kind of narcissistic in a way, right? So no one even knows that this is me when they come in here, which is super cool. Now these wooden panels, I love the way they look. And one cool thing about them is that you can just turn on a light. So it adds this really nice mood soft lighting to the room. I put this vase here mostly to hide just that plug there. And I think it looks really good in the YouTube videos as well. So the thing is I have three bedrooms in this apartment, right? And it's mostly being used for work, YouTube studio, the office, but I also needed it to be a guest room because I do have guests that come in once in a while and I didn't have a place for them. So what I decided is to put this Murphy bed in here and this actually comes down and turns into a very comfortable queen size bed with a memory foam mattress. So it's actually really comfortable for guests. They can come, they stay here, they can use this desk to work if they want to. It's a nice space, they got the view. All right, let's get to where the magic happens, the master bedroom right in here. This bedroom is a dream for me, honestly. This is the first time that I've ever been able to fit a king bed into a bedroom. And it's just so comfortable. It's so nice to be able to just spread out. I don't spend a lot of time here. Since I have three bedrooms and I have my office here, it just doesn't make sense for me to spend too much time here. But there are weekends, I'm not feeling good, or if I just wanna chill, I definitely throw on the TV and I hang out here for a little bit, watching DRIVE to survive. Above the bed, I haven't really figured out what I wanna do yet, so you can see it's not hanging. It's just kinda chilling here. And this is an art piece by my tattoo artist, Oscar Caramel. The guy's an absolute legend, so I'm happy to just have his work, not only on my body, but also here at home. I have matching nightstands here. I bought these two lamps that I thought were really cool. Tom Ford book of course is a must. Over here, made a nice little nook, little corner situation here. This is a France and sun chair. It's super cozy and comfortable. I love the design. And I put my Taylor guitar right next to it because once in a while I just come here, sit down, play the guitar, especially on the weekends. There's nothing better for me to just hang out here and chill. This is my first ever plant that I bought. It's seen better days. I'm trying to save it, but I think I over-watered it and apparently with snake plants, that's a really big issue. So, you know, I'm learning as I go here, rolling with the punches over here. This is kind of, you know, my treasure chest is where I keep all of my necklaces, my rings, you know, I have some bracelets, literally everything I would ever need when it comes to accessories. The TVs and LG 65 or 65 inches. Honestly, I've had this for a while. I got it in LA. I have a nice little Aston Martin book here. On this side, I have another one of those lamps. I think I got them on Etsy, to be honest with you. A couple of books, another Aston Martin book and a Creed book. My watch stand, a candle, my Google home so I can set an alarm at night or play music or turn off all of my lights. It's really nice just having the Google assistant here with me. This wall felt really empty so I wasn't sure what to put here. But I just feel like the mirror really opens it up and brings more light in here and it's also a lot of fun. Something I really like about this bedroom is how big this entryway is. And at first I wasn't sure what to do with it because it is kind of an awkward space even though it's a big space, but decided to put this bench and the frame. My closet is right here, so I like to bring out my shoes, change shoes here before I head out, and that works really well. So it ended up being very useful after all. Alright, let me show you the master bathroom now. This bathroom is honestly a dream. It's so interesting. When I was looking for an apartment, I'm looking for things that the typical person probably doesn't care for, but I needed a long, spacious bathroom not because I needed for myself but just because we shoot a lot of videos in this bathroom. So I was looking at measurements and trying to see if I could fit a tripod in here. If I could, you know, if I could have my videographer Rodrigo like over here or there. So there's a lot of things in this apartment that I had to think of from a creator's perspective and not really like, oh, I'm living here. What kind of bathroom do I want for myself or personal use? And, you know, there's a big mirror, which means we can shoot videos coming from the mirror. This does annoy me a little bit having these lines here. I think it annoys Rodrigo more than anyone. It's like, I wish the lines weren't there. Besides that, I love, love this bathroom. I honestly, it's a big ass shower, big shower head. You know, we have eucalyptus up there. It smells really nice and the floor, my favorite part of this bathroom, the floor is heated and Rodrigo is nodding his his head right now because he's got socks on and he's like, yeah, it's, it's so nice coming in here at night. You know, I gotta go to the bathroom, wake up middle of the night coming here and I step into the nice warm floor. It's just so relaxing and so nice. It's something that I had never experienced before. So I really, really like it. This is where I keep all of my grooming products. We just launched the beard oil, for example, which is so addicting. Feel like every time I come in here, I put it on. It just adds that natural shine to my beard and it's something that's our newest product with Forte. So it's something I'm very excited for. But I love this medicine cabinet as much as we don't like the lines for shooting. I didn't have a mirror that opened like this, a medicine cabinet in LA. So I had to put everything underneath. And I really actually appreciate having the extra storage, being able to put everything back here. Alright, behind this door we have my closet. I don't know if I've ever showed my entire closet before, but here it is. I am so grateful that I have a walk-in closet because as you know, I have a lot of clothes, you know I need them for styling. I need them for different events and different videos that I make, you know But I have all of my jackets here and then some like shirt jackets, cardigans, and then shirts This is the only closet I'm gonna show you. I do have three or four closets But this is the main big closet. The other ones are not walk-in closets I have all of my shoes in these really neat display boxes here that I got from IKEA I have all of my pants here and then I have this style of hanger here Which I think is super cool because it hangs up like this on the rod But then you can just create space by letting one of them drop I added these hanging shelves because I didn't have enough room for my sweaters as you can see they take a lot of space And this was the perfect Amazon fine fits in really nicely here I have all of my ties and belts right here and then I have my actual caps right here in this this dock that I purchased recently and I think it just keeps everything really nice and neat. All right let's step into the bathroom here. This is the guest bathroom. It's the bathroom that I don't typically use but my assistant Megan uses it, Rodrigo uses it and then anytime I have a guest but it's funny when I first walked into this bathroom I was like it's kind of ugly. I don't really like the tiles. It's kind of weird. I don't know why it did that. After some time I realized that I actually really really like this bathroom. I love I love the way it looks on camera. It matches the Forte series aesthetic, my brand's aesthetic really well. So anytime we're shooting something, it just looks really clean, really good. And it's a nice guest bathroom. We have a shower, right? We have a bathtub over here, which I don't think I've ever used. I'm not gonna lie. I don't think I've ever used this bathtub and I'm just realizing that as I'm doing this video now, which is kind of sad. It's a nice bathroom. Rodrigo spends like 30 minutes a day in here. Just, I don't even know what he's doing in here. Living here has been an absolute dream and it's been really fun hanging out with you guys, but it's time for you to go. And, Roger, you gotta go. Are you serious right now? Yeah. Can I at least get my bag? No, I got a girl coming over. Can you have this edited by tomorrow? No. Tomorrow, please. Thanks, bye."

        "transcript": " I truly believe that when you have a nice haircut, you feel your absolute best. That feeling when you leave that barber chair, it feels good. You just feel like a million dollars. You feel unstoppable. You feel so confident and that's what I want you to feel every single day no matter your age. So in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you the best hairstyles for each age group so you can dial in your looks no matter your hair length, your hairline, and your age. I'm going to give you multiple options to make sure that you look your best. First, if you're a teenager in high school, this is your time to explore. This is the best time to try new hairstyles. And take it from me because I went to military school growing up, so I was only allowed to have a bus cut during that time. And I remember always looking at my friends and being jealous of them because they could grow out their hair and it just looked a lot better than mine. So as a young man, you should definitely go through this process of trial and error, figure out what works for you, figure out what doesn't look good because that is the time to explore. And a great start is a messy French crop with the faded sides and back. It's super popular, it's everywhere right now. And it's very clean. out the sleek sides, the texture top lets you customize it in different ways. You can, you know, just kind of make it pretty messy, which makes it low effort too. And it's a good hairstyle if you want to make a statement. The texture top gives you that trendy edgy vibe and it's the kind of hairstyle that all your friends will be jealous of. Plus, like I said, it's easy to take care of and style. Just use the Forte series sea salt spray or if you sprinkle a little bit of texture powder and massage it onto your hair, it's going to look amazing and it's super easy. And if you're feeling bold, if you feel like you wanna be seen, if you're feeling invisible, the modern mullet can be a great choice. Look, it's got a shorter top where you don't have to go too long, but the back is a little bit longer and that's what makes it the mullet, right? It's extremely popular right now and it's the kind of hairstyle that only looks good when you're younger. You don't wanna be rocking a modern mullet when you're 35, 45, it's just not really the go-to look. So I would say, this is the perfect time to have that hairstyle. This is the perfect time to explore it. Another hairstyle that works really well for teens is the middle part, also known as the curtains. Now, if you look at the young TV stars in the 90s, so many of them have a middle part. And nowadays, it's just as trendy. And for this hairstyle to work, you're gonna need to grow out your hair a little longer, about five inches up top, so you get that nice flow. And I would style it with a Forte sea salt spray. Now, as you hit 18 to 24, which by the way, amazing age, right, most of your friends will also start upgrading their looks and you experience a lot of big life changes. You go to college, you're living alone, maybe you're traveling, right? So it's another really great opportunity to try new styles and to stand out. You're also probably dating around this time. So you want to look good for the ladies, right? The middle part flow looks really good at this age too. So if you haven't had this haircut before, I highly recommend you try it because as you get older, let's say in your 30s, it's not the best hairstyle for that age, unless you still have a ton of hair and it works for you. So, if you don't try it now, you might lose your chance. So that's why I say when you're younger, definitely try different hairstyles because maybe you won't have the option to do so later on in life. The French crop is also perfect if you're 18 to 24. And if you have short hair, it's amazing, right? Keep it 3 to 4 inches on top, you comb it forward and you fade the sides. And you can just use the forte texture powder with your fingers to add that natural texture. It's kind of cool how it's messy, right? But it's not a mess if you get the difference. This is controlled chaos. It's messy on purpose, which is completely different from just having messy, bad hair. Okay, let's talk about maybe my favorite hairstyle of all time, the textured quiff. Now what I like the most about this hairstyle is the fact that it can be classy, right? And almost vintage inspired if you want as well. Or you can mess it up a little bit more and make it more modern, more young. And the best part is that these are the same exact haircut, right? It's just styled differently so that you get a two for one here, which is great. All you have to do is ask your hairstylist to leave 3 to 4 inches up top, then shorter sides. And you can go with a scissor cut for a more mature look, kind of like mine. Or even a fade if you want to look younger, if you want to go a little bit more bold. And the key to styling this and making it look great, you have to blow dry it upwards and backwards to lift the roots. And then you just use the Forte Series Texture Clay Extreme Hold to hold the quiff in place. This is our best selling product, by the way. It has the best hold in the market, so your hair is not going to fall flat halfway through your day. Also, it adds a slight natural shine so that your hair looks really healthy right away. Now, if you have longer hair and if you feel like having some fun, check out the Modern Wolf Cut. It's definitely on the edgy side, right? But it shows personality. It has this kind of shaggy layered look. That's really cool. And I see a lot of guys here in New York rocking this all the time because it's a more fashion forward haircut. Also, this is really big in Asia right now, which makes sense because, like I said, you know, they tend to be more fashion forward and this is a more fashion forward hairstyle. To make it look good, your hair needs to be healthy though. It's not one of those hairstyles that you can just wing it. So make sure to hydrate your hair. Apply the forte hydrating oil to damp hair and then air dry or use a diffuser to bring out those really great layers and texture. And then you can just finish it off with a small amount of the hair styling cream for that additional healthy shine. Now the most important thing here is when you're washing your hair, leave the conditioner on for about two minutes to keep your hair healthy, to give it that nice flow, especially because it's longer hair. Longer hair obviously needs more time for management, right? It's harder to manage. So it all starts in the shower. Moving on to ages 25 to 32. And maybe you've just started your career, maybe you're already a little bit more underway, but you're a young professional. You're probably making a little bit more money. You just got a girlfriend, right? At this age, what's important is that you choose a hairstyle that is presentable, but it still shows some youth. Just because you're 29, 30, it doesn't mean that you can't have fun, but you should try hairstyles. They're more on the classy side. You're not a teenager anymore. You're not going to school anymore. You're a man now. And I'll start with an easy option, the short quiff. It's got shorter size than usual, and then it's got that medium to short length up top, especially in the front. If you have straight hair, this is a great option for you. Just go for a fade or really short size, kind of like mine. It works for casual and formal occasions, whether you're wearing a suit or a t-shirt and shorts, because it's a clean cut. It gives you that professional look, but it's also pretty simple. It's not edgy or bold. It's a safe hairstyle, let's be honest. and your hair can literally be two to three inches up top for this, so it's pretty easy to get there. You can style it upwards, you can style it backwards, kind of similar to the textured quiff, but the only difference is this is a lot shorter, a lot easier to maintain. And if you want the safest haircut of them all, right, this is probably the most popular hairstyle in the world, by the way, for men, it's the side part. Guys in every age group can have this haircut, it's a very low maintenance hairstyle, and it gives you that classic polished look. Now, I don't necessarily love the side part just because it's too simple having said that, like I talk about hair on YouTube. So for me, I think it would be a little bit too simple, but it's a very easy and safe hairstyle. I do like a variation of that, which I call the 80-20 part. It's kind of what I have going on right now. It's just a side part, but the part is a little bit higher. So instead of parting it down here, you just go up a little bit more. So you have 80% there, 20% there. It's just a little bit higher instead of being down here. Now I style mine with a little bit of thickening spray first, like three sprays and then we'll damp wet hair. That's it. Blow dry. And then I used either the texture clay or today I'm actually using the hair styling cream. By the way, if you have longer hair, man, there's so many different styles to choose from. Guys like Matthew McConaughey, Sean Mandage, Harry Styles, right, they've all had this type of longer, medium length, let's say hair before, I call it the flow. And it's a really cool vintage look. It works really well with the old money aesthetic. It gives you that high end look, but with a good amount of volume and texture that will definitely get people's attention. I had this hairstyle myself for a little while and if I could, I'd probably rock it again. It just takes a little bit longer to get there and I don't think I have the patience for it right now. But man, it got a lot of compliments. It's a compliment getter. And the great thing about it is that it's low maintenance. Once you get there, it can be pretty low maintenance and your hair doesn't need to be super long. Again, focus on keeping your hair healthy and hydrated. That's the number one thing. So definitely use some oils, use a good conditioner and that's all that you need. But look, as you get older, your priorities will start to change. And as a result, your hairstyle options could reflect maybe a little bit more sophistication, right? A more mature vibe when you're 33 to 45. And this hairstyle might be a surprise, but I have to start with the buzz cut. It is super clean, very simple, and it gives you a classic, masculine, strong look, especially if your personal style is on point, if you have good style. Every guy should have a buzz cut at least once in their lives. I say this in every hair video, I feel like a broken record, but listen, every guy should have a bus cut, every guy should have long hair at least once in your life. Just try it. And honestly, a bus cut is the best. And it requires literally no maintenance, right? It saves you so much time in the morning when you're getting ready. It's also perfect if you have an active lifestyle because you can wash it so easily. There's no dry time. It's literally just like you wake up, you're done. You're ready to go. There's nothing else you need to do to your hair. And you can hit up your barber every couple of weeks to keep it fresh or you can just do what I actually used to do back in military school and I just buzzed it myself. So you can definitely just get clippers and buzz it yourself. And by the way, when I say buzz cut, don't be afraid to experiment a little with the length. Play around with different clipper guards until you find the perfect length that complements your face shape. And you can even get a fade on the sides and the back. You can taper it so you can still, a buzz cut doesn't mean like just buzz it all in one length. You can still have fun with it. And if you can grow a beard, Line it up nicely. That with the buzz cut is going to look obviously extremely masculine. It's a very strong strong look Another amazing haircut for guys that age is the crew cut, which is a classic. It's versatile low maintenance It's just tapered on the sides and the back and it's got a little bit longer hair up top So again very very simple now the top hair is usually between half an inch to two inches long and the hair on top It kind of gradually gets shorter as it moves towards the back But if you're in this age group and you still have a good head of hair, which is rare by the way, and you want to have a little fun, I got a suggestion for you. Try a medium length wavy hairstyle and Keanu Reeves pulls this off really well, right? It's made of like kind of like a neck length hair, right? A little past like your jaw here with layers cut in, which adds movement. It keeps it from getting too heavy and too just bulky. So it looks really nice. The layers make it super easy to wear straight or smooth or wavy, you know, and if you have wave your curly hair, you can definitely use a diffuser and embrace those curls, embrace those waves. And it actually makes you look more, more useful, more laid back. Again, this is another hairstyle that you have to keep it healthy. It needs to look good. So it needs some nice natural shine, you know, make sure to use the styling cream. You don't want to go super complicated. There's no need. But make sure that you're applying oil to your hair. Make sure that you're taking care of those split ends because this is when it makes a difference. Now from 40 to 50 and beyond, what's going on to my older audience here, look, you want hairstyles that still look great and work with your hair without sacrificing your personal style. You want something like a classic crew cut, right? It's a great choice here too. It works if you have kind of thinning hair, which is a big issue for guys, especially in that age group, your hair starts to thin out a little bit. So the classic crew cut actually hides it a little bit. Now if you're not thinning if you still have a good amount of hair then definitely a textured volume style is also a winner. It just gives you a little bit more length up top to play with right so you can get some really nice texture volume you can style it in different ways every day it's gonna look a little bit different and this style will 100% make you stand out without seeming like you're trying too hard right I think when you're older you don't want to look like you're trying too hard either when you're younger you don't want to do that when you're older you don't want to do that don't ask me I don't make the rules but similar to to the quiff, you can easily style this just with the 14 series texture clay. It gives you that amazing texture. It keeps everything in place and it looks so good. Now this is a great choice if you want something that's polished, but of course, still shows your youthful, young, fun side. Just cause you're 45 and up, it doesn't mean that you have to look old and stuffy. So this is a great option. And if you're blessed with longer, thicker hair, definitely go for long and textured waves. Again, another classic. This is just a really elegant style and you just kind of comb your hair back away from your face, and that's kind of it. You can just blow dry the hair back if you want, or if you wanna just kind of mess it up, push it backwards, let it air dry, it's gonna look so good. But what you have to watch out for, if you're pretty much any hair that's longer than three inches, is making sure that it's healthy, because otherwise it's gonna be frizzy, it's gonna be dry, it's gonna be flaky, right? You're gonna have split ends, and that just doesn't look good. So you should definitely watch this video right here, if you're ready to understand the mistakes that are probably ruining your hair today."

        "transcript": " It's such a shame that most men are making these seven hair mistakes without even realizing. And I want you to look your best, so I'm not wasting any time. Let's go over each of these mistakes and I'll also show you exactly how you can change your hair from dull, lifeless, dry to smooth, shiny hair that will literally have women complimenting you on how great it looks. And first, the main reason why when you try to copy someone's hairstyle, maybe a photo you saw of someone online or your favorite celebrity's hairstyle, it just doesn't work, right? It doesn't look the same. because everyone has a different hair type. And there's an easy way to find out what your hair type is. And we're gonna do it right now together. And by the way, this isn't a new thing. It's just that most men don't know this. Us guys, we never really learned our hair type when we were growing up, right? But the system was actually created back in the 90s by Oprah's hairstylist, Andre Walker. So it's been around for a while. Here's how you can tell which hair type you have. Hair types are categorized by numbering and lettering system. So it starts from one A, which is super straight and fine, all the way to 4C which is coily and thick. And the numbers refer to the type of curl pattern. So one is straight, two is wavy, three is curly and four is coily. The letters A, B, C show how tight the curls or the waves are, with A being the loosest and C being the tightest. Now, why does this matter? Because using the wrong products or getting the wrong haircut for your hair type will actually make your hair look like shit. So let me give you quick tips for each hair type. If you have type one hair, you want something that won't make your hair too oily or weigh it down. A product that works really well for that hair type is the Forte Series Texture Powder because it adds volume and texture which this hair type needs, right? It's really straight with no texture, with no volume. You should also go for lightweight sprays like a sea salt or thickening spray that'll be perfect here because they add volume without adding grease. For two way to two C, which is wavy hair, you're gonna want something that defines those waves without making them crunchy. So use a light cream like the Forte Series Hair Styling Cream which is perfect for this, or the sea salt spray which is one of our best selling products because it keeps going viral on TikTok. For 3A to 3C, which is curly hair, hydration is actually gonna be your best friend. So look for products that moisturize and define your curls, like curl creams, hydrating oil, or a cream that won't dry out your hair. And for 4A to 4C coils, rich, nourishing products are the way to go. So heavy creams, oils, and leave-in conditioners, that will keep your hair looking healthy and looking great. If you haven't figured it out by now, using the right hair products for your hair type is an absolute game changer. So make sure that you're buying high quality products and the right products for your hair type and your hairstyle. But if you've ever had dry or itchy scalp or if your hair looks dull, it doesn't have that healthy shine to it, right? Then you'll probably be making this next mistake. By now, I'm sure that you've heard that you have natural oils in your hair and your scalp and that these oils are actually really important for hair health and for growth. And you probably know by now as well that shampoo is actually strip away those natural oils. But there's one more thing in your shower that's stripping away those oils that isn't shampoo. The oils on your scalp can be in a semi-solid state. They don't drip down your head when you look down, right? They're not runny, they're not liquid. But when hot water melts those oils, it makes them really easy to be washed away in the shower, which then causes your hair to be dry, itchy, flake, and even the hair strands themselves lose that nice, healthy shine, and they become dull and frizzy. And look, I know that hot showers feel great, they're relaxing, but they actually strip away all of the good stuff your hair needs. So instead of using hot water, use lukewarm or cold water. The same way that you wouldn't water a plant with hot, steamy water, right? Lukewarm water actually gets the job done without being too harsh. It keeps those natural oils in your hair so it can grow strong, smooth and shiny, which is what we all want. But a lot of guys are still messing up because most men don't realize there is a way to know the exact amount of product that your hair needs. And to explain why this happens, you need to understand hair porosity. Hair porosity explains how your hair absorbs and holds moisture or products. So if you have high porosity, think of it like a sponge that sucks up everything very quickly. And if you have low porosity, it barely lets any water in. Now I'm assuming you don't know what your hair porosity is and don't worry because most men don't, but there's a really easy test that you can do. You just take one strand of clean hair, needs to be clean, no product, no oils, just clean hair, and drop it into a glass of water. And if it sinks fast, you're looking at high porosity. Now if it floats, you've got low porosity. And if you take some time between sinking, then your medium porosity. This test is so easy, and it helps you figure out how much product to use. Look, it might seem like a lot of work to grab a hair strand, run these tests, but really, it's gonna take you a couple of minutes to do it, and you only have to do it once, and then you know whether it's one C, two B, or whatever, and then whether it's a high, medium, or low porosity. All of that within two minutes, and it's for the rest of your life. So it might seem like we're running a little science project here, but this is knowledge that you carry with you for the rest of your life. And if you have high porosity, because of that fast absorption, you might need to use a little bit more product to keep it moisturized, right? Because it's sucking that product in. But you can't go overboard because all of a sudden then your hair looks greasy. And if your hair is low porosity, you're gonna notice that hair products tend to sit on top of it instead of getting absorbed. And that means that your hair gets weighed down really easily. So instead of adding too much, you should start with a smaller amount of product and see how it goes because it's not going into your hair. It's just sitting on top of it and weighing it down. But before adding any products, 70% of people ruin their hair right after the shower without even realizing it. And maybe you're a part of that statistic because of how you dry your hair. Now we've all been guilty of this at some point, right? Grabbing the closest towel and then just aggressively rubbing your hair to dry it as quickly as possible. We're men, we want it to be practical, we want it to be quick. But here's the thing, being too rough on your wet hair can actually do way more harm than good. especially vulnerable when it's wet and it can easily break. Wet hair is in its most delicate state. That's why you need to treat it like gold, alright? It's important to go easy when you're drying or when you're brushing wet hair. First, what I would recommend is actually switching to a microfiber towel and gently patting your hair instead of, you know, rubbing it with a regular towel and going crazy. That's going to be way better for your hair in the long run and it's going to prevent breakage, it's going to prevent frizz, and if you're thinning, which, you know, A lot of guys start to thin around late 20s, early 30s even. This is going to be a lot better for long term because you're going to lose a lot less hair. And when it comes to detangling your wet hair, reach for a wide tooth comb or a brush that's actually specifically designed for wet hair. These brushes are made to be more gentle without pulling or breaking your hair when you're brushing it. And speaking of hair brushes, there's another mistake that the majority of guys are making and it's actually kind of gross and it's very easy to fix though. You know how your hair sometimes gets greasy really fast after you wash it? It might be because you're not cleaning your hairbrush or the comb that you use. I mean, think about it, your hair has product in it, it has all these oils or conditioner, whatever, and you're brushing your hair, maybe you have some dry skin, some dandruff, and then you keep just reusing that dirty brush and all of that oil, the gunk, it all goes back into your clean hair, ruining all of that hard work of cleansing it out in the shower. In fact, when is the last time that you cleaned your tools? I'm sure it's been a while, right? Because I know that before I learned this, I never washed my hairbrushes. I would just never, I would maybe pull some hair out, but that's kind of it until I learned about this. Now, I didn't realize how much it was messing out my hair. Now, of course, I clean and I wash my brushes every few months or whenever they start looking a little gross, I'm like, okay, it's about time for a clean. It's super easy. All you have to do is clean it out and make sure that it's clean. And look, scalp infections, dandruff, and even hair loss can be triggered by the buildup of bacteria from your styling tools. So make sure that they're clean. And this mistake is so easy to fix. All you gotta do is use some warm water and shampoo to clean that brush, or you can soak them into water and vinegar. If they haven't been cleaned in a while, you can just leave them in there for 20 minutes and that is it, it's done. Okay, so if you follow my Instagram, you probably saw that I recently got into plants. I finally got some real plants. I used to only have fake plants because I'm not good at keeping real ones alive, all right? But using a plant analogy, which I think goes really well here, is if their leaves start to droop, right? If they start looking unhealthy, you don't just trim the leaves and it's like, all right, cool, we're good. You know, call it a day. You actually check the soil because that's usually where the problem starts and it's the same for hair. Our scalp is the soil, but most guys ignore it and they wonder why their hair isn't looking good. If you want your hair to grow well, you gotta take care of your scalp. Even if you can't see it, it's still important. And the American Academy of Dermatology actually says that our scalp has around 100,000 hair follicles, which is why stimulating that blood flow is key. So make sure to massage your scalp regularly. You know, you can use a scalp massager. It feels really nice. It feels luxurious. It's very relaxing. And it's gonna help your hair grow even faster. So if your hair isn't growing as fast as you wanted to, your scalp might be the issue. And the scalp massages, they actually keep the blood flowing and the skin healthy. And it allows your hair follicles to get the nutrients they need to grow strong and to grow healthy. But overcoming this next mistake is what make the biggest difference for my hair personally. Honestly, it was night and day for me. Once I learned this, my hair just looked so much better. I actually felt kind of stupid for not knowing this earlier and I'm talking about hair masks and I actually did one earlier today, this morning when I took a shower and when I first tried them, I was skeptical, I wasn't sure, I was like, this is for women, I don't need that, I don't really have super long hair and I wasn't expecting much to be honest, but man, I was really wrong because masks, it's like a super food for your hair, right? They're packed with the nutrients like a way beyond what your standard conditioner can do. And my hair went from being lifeless and dull, to be honest, like pretty dry and kind of brittle, to soft, shinier, and healthier. And that was like, it was super quick. It was within a couple of uses. What I would say is do a mask once a week and look for a mask that fixes issues that you notice in your hair. So for example, if you need moisture, if you feel like your hair is really dried out, right? Go for a hydrating mask. Coconut oil, argan oil. And if you want to strengthen your hair because maybe it's breaking, there's a lot of frizz going on and breakage, you might want to go with a protein treatment like keratin, for example, which is a solid choice. And I'm going to link my favorites in the description of this video in my Amazon storefront. I always update my Amazon storefront with the best and the latest. So if you want to go and give it a follow, I highly recommend it. So you have the best products. If you combine all of these tips, there's no way your hair won't look good. So all you have to do now is choose the right hairstyle. And for the best hairstyle ideas, I got this video right here for you."

        "transcript": " After months of reading scientific studies and analyzing past civilizations, I found these nine hacks to improve your facial attractiveness. All are backed by science and lasted through history. But they're surprisingly simple and they work for any guy. These are straightforward methods that will transform your looks in days. By the way, all without these pricey products or lengthy routine. And the final hack has even been proven to make you 53% more attractive to women. So I found out about this first hack after reading up on the history of self-care routines. Ancient civilizations had a strong obsession with charcoal. Historians and scientists, they've documented its use by the ancient Greeks, by Mayans, the Romans, and it was also used in traditional Chinese medicine. Now this ingredient, it's been a staple for dental hygiene for centuries. But what gives? What's so special about charcoal? You see, there's a variation called activated charcoal. And when it's applied, just like a vacuum, it sucks up the stains on your teeth. It's super absorbent and it latches on to most stains like your morning coffee, glass of wine or whatever meal you just had. Now when you brush with it, the tiny charcoal particles, they stick to the discoloration, the stains on your teeth and they pull them away when you rinse. But I get it. Look, using something as raw as charcoal, it might sound a little bit out of the left field, but hey, there's one thing I've learned is that you always want to keep things simple, especially when it comes to self-care routine. So here's the simplest hack to whiten your smile. go on Amazon or your local healthcare store, or I'm gonna link some below, and grab some activated charcoal powder. Now dab it onto your toothbrush and gently brush away. It's powerful, so make sure that you don't overdo it. Use it once or twice a week, max, or you're actually risk damaging your teeth because it is a powerful ingredient. All right, but before we start brushing, this next hack is something that I found that you can easily add in just before. Now everyone knows that the skin on your face, it actually sheds dead skin cells. And to deal with that, we need to exfoliate, right? We've talked about this on the channel before. Well, if that's the case, then why don't guys do this for their lips? Because women like men with nice lips, because we know this, especially when it's paired with other masking features, which we'll cover later in this video. Now, ignoring your lips is gonna lead to dead skin building up all over your lips, and you end up with dry, chapped lips, which no one wants. This is bound to happen, especially during cold, dry, or windy weather. Now, I know you don't wanna repel women away, you actually want to attract them to you, So here's what you need to do. Before you brush your teeth, you're gonna gently brush your lips with that toothbrush for about 15 to 20 seconds. Then apply a lip balm or Vaseline to keep them moisturized throughout the day. Honestly, just do this for a week and you're gonna see, you're gonna end up with smooth soft lips that appear a lot brighter and more attractive. And during my research, I also found a really good hack that you can use in your morning routine. You know those days you wake up and your face looks puffy, it looks swollen, maybe you have some bags under your eyes. Well, I found the solution to that and it actually feels really, really good. It wakes you up, it feels really refreshing, and it has your face defined in minutes. In a study in 2018, dermatologists actually found that facial massage rollers, they boost blood flow to your face, which creates a healthy glow. They also looked at cold therapy and how that affects your skin. So when you put anything cold on your skin, like let's say, you know, ice water or an ice cube, it triggers something called vasoconstriction. This is just a fancy term for your blood vessels tightening up, basically constricting. and it restricts blood flow to your face. Now, this is your body's natural response to the cold. It happens, right? And it helps cut down on swelling, it helps cut down on redness, that's why you apply ice when something is inflamed, for example. Now, once your skin warms back up, blood circulation in your face kicks into overdrive. And that extra blood flow, it's like a nutrient-packed smoothie. It flushes out all of that bad toxins, right? It feeds your skin cells with all the good stuff, plus it tightens up your skin and makes your pores look even smaller. And to make this so easy, nowadays they even have an ice roller. I have one literally in my freezer right now that I use every morning. You just gently apply it to your face for a few minutes every morning, and that is it. The cold will tighten those blood vessels. And that means that you're gonna reduce puffiness and it gives you that chiseled look that everyone wants. And just as important as your looks, if not more important is your mindset. Having a strong mindset gives you a ton of confidence to get out there and live the best life possible.

So some of you know this, but I lived in LA for 10 years, which is a long time to be in Los Angeles. You can go a little crazy out there, but I noticed that a lot of men out there had really nice, perfect skin. And a lot of them were on camera, they were hosts for shows, or they were TV anchors or whatever. And I'm like, how do you get such great skin? And I found out the tip that most guys would never even say that they use, but they do. And it's one little product that blurs out any imperfections on your skin. And after you use it, it evens out your skin tone. But before we jump to conclusions, it's not makeup, all right? It's called a tinted moisturizer, and I highly recommend you try it out. and it's so easy to use. So it's basically a regular moisturizer, right? So what I like to do is I wash my face in the morning, I moisturize it in the morning, but then before I go out, I just apply a little bit of that tinted moisturizer evenly throughout my skin, throughout my face, and that blurs any imperfections. If I have a pimple and I, you know, I wanna go on a date and I wanna make sure that I look my best, or if I'm just going out with friends and I wanna make sure that my face, you know, doesn't look textured, I apply this and it's like, it's like magic, you know? You can literally just go about your day with a moisturized, wrinkle-free, and spotless face. And the one that I get is from Africa Skincare, of course, I'm gonna link it below, but make sure that you get the right shades because there are two different ones. And for this fifth method, I found a routine that ancient royalty used, and they used it to stand out thousands of years ago. In fact, I actually had to read up on ancient Egypt to understand where this hack even came from. And funny enough, this hack is coming back now. Back then, people believed that using a dark mineral substance provided protection from not just the sun's ray, but also from evil spirits. Men called the substance coal, and they would even line their eyes with it. That's why if you look at statues or paintings of ancient Egyptians and pharaohs, they look like they're wearing something that kind of resembles eyeliner, right? And it's seen as the ancient Egyptian look. Now, look, I'm not saying that you should be wearing, you know, eyeliner, wearing makeup. I mean, Pharrell, Johnny Depp, and a lot of other guys have tried this look. So I'm not saying you can't do it, But the point here is that highlighting your eyes in any way will make you look more alert, will make you look more attractive. Personally, I like to use whitening eye drops. They make the whites of your eyes look a lot brighter, especially in those days that your eyes look real tired or they look red. A lot of times I'll use it before I shoot these videos too because besides making my eyes look better, they also have an energizing effect. It gets me hyped up to shoot these videos for you. And also, I'm staring at a few different lights here, so I need my eyes to be fresh. And if you look closely, there's one more change that I made to my face a long time ago that completely changed the way that women looked at me. Scientists discovered in a survey that 61% of women preferred men with some form of facial hair over being clean shaven. Now, I know not every guy can pull off or grow a full beer. So if you can only grow a patchy beer, and if it's holding you back, you're not alone, right? You're just like the thousands of guys missing out on this cheat code, basically. So what you need to do is grab this. It's called a beard pencil. And it's designed to fill in those gaps. It gives you a naturally fuller, more defined look. Just a few strokes of that pencil, you blend it in, and boom, instantly you get that full beard, instant confidence boost, and some guys even use this to fill in small gaps in their hairline, because it only takes a second and it doesn't just come off very easily, and it will look great every single time. Now, I know some guys might think it's cringe, or you know, think like they're wearing makeup, or it's fake, but I want you to realize that tools like these, they allow you to maximize your potential. A lot of these celebrities or attractive people that you see on social media on TV, they're all using these hacks. I've seen it. I lived in LA for 10 years. Like I said, this is something that they do every single day. It definitely beats walking out with a patchy beard or a bad hairline, right? That's literally why I created this pencil for Forte series because I know that so many guys use it and wanted something from a brand they could trust. So I would love for you to give it a try. I'm going to list it below. I'm sure that you're going to love it. If you can't grow any facial hair, that's a completely different problem. Well, first, I completely understand how frustrating that might be because psychologists have found that people perceive men with a tidy full beard as being more mature, as being higher in the social status. So I know a lot of you may feel a little insecure about not being able to grow a beard. And trust me, I get comments from guys all the time asking me, how can I grow my beard? My beard's not coming in, what do I do? Well, I did a lot of research before coming across the seventh hack. It's a product that needs a little bit more patience and discipline, but it can get crazy results. And with this product, in a few months to a year, you can actually have a nice beard. It's called mynoxidil, and it's a liquid or a foam solution. Actually originally it was a tablet, and it was taken to treat high blood pressure, but one of the side effects was an increase in hair growth, which led scientists to then develop a new product focused on just hair growth. And at first it was just used for, you know, your head because guys are thinning, they need a solution, boom, apply monoxide, so it's great. But after a while, guys tried it on their faces and they saw great results as well. I'm not going to go into exactly how it works, but I am going to recommend you do your own research because this is a product that's a little bit harsher than the other products. And you want to make sure that you're using it correctly. I take my nonxid on myself. I did my own research and it's worked well for me. Now for you, please do your own research and make sure that you're doing everything properly. If you paired my Noxial with this next hack, you're not only going to accelerate your beard gains, but you're going to get that smooth glass skin that models always have. The glass skin that we all want, right? Perfect looking skin. This eighth method might sound a little intense at first, but trust me, it works and people use it all the time. So back in the 90s, Canadian plastic surgeon, Dr. Andre Cameron, he made a huge discovery. A patient who had really bad scarring, he needed help. And after trying all these methods, which failed, he decided to experiment with something So after a while of brainstorming all these different options, he decided to lightly puncture the skin of the patient with tattoo needles. And to their surprise, this actually improved the appearance of scars. The crazy thing is, this was all done without any product or any medication. Only through your own body's healing mechanism. And then of course they made it much better. It wasn't just a tattoo needle anymore, it became an actual micro-needling technique. And they became recognized worldwide. They're safe, they're effective, and they work on wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, and millions of people use them. But why does it work? And what do I mean by your body's healing mechanism? Well, dermarolling works by creating these micro little injuries on your skin. Now, don't freak out, these are just tiny and you can't really feel them unless you go really hard, which you shouldn't be going that hard. But here's what I think is pretty cool. The process actually tricks your body into entering the healing mode, and he ramps up your collagen and elastin production. And as a result, you get that smoother skin, you get fewer scars, and it even promotes hair growth by waking up those sleepy follicles. Now, I know the idea of rolling needles on your face, you know, it seems a little daunting and overwhelming and painful, but trust me, if you do your own research, learn the right technique and use a good dermaroller, it's safe, it's effective, and it actually is a lot less scary than it sounds. I own a dermaroller myself. I use it on my scalp once in a while, my hairline, I'm going to link it in the description of this video below. Make sure that you do it consistently and you're going to see a lot of improvements within a couple of months. Now there's one more thing that most guys neglect that triggers 53% more attraction in women. In fact, I bet you're still focused on improving your face, your hair, your clothes, your body, right? But you still forget this single area because you see during my study, I found out the evolutionary biologist suggests that a strong, well-defined neck is not just a sign of physical strength, but it actually impacts how masculine and how attractive you appear. Something that I never even thought about, what do you mean my neck? I have to have a strong masculine neck, how do I do that? But a strong neck also helps improve your posture. It frames your face, it enhances your jawline and your overall facial attractiveness. So if you actually think about it, it makes sense. But then here's the question, how do you achieve a thicker, more masculine neck? Two words, neck training. Now I'm a big Formula One fan, I don't know if you guys have watched F1 at all, But those guys, those drivers, they have really strong necks because they have to make really high speed turns and then their necks, it needs to hold the head, which is heavy, plus a helmet and crazy G-forces. Otherwise, their necks are just going to go crazy, right? Just fall that way. Now, you don't need to go all out and become one of these gym memes, right? You don't need to become an F1 driver, even though that would be really sick and I'd love to be your friend if you become one. Please invite me to all the races. But having a skinny neck can make you look scrawny. So let me show you an easy way to fix that at home without looking crazy. All you have to do is two sets of neck curls. Now I know it sounds funny, but just lie on your back and put your hand on your forehead. Then in a controlled motion, you're going to push your hand down while lifting and pushing up with your head. You're going to kind of curl your neck forward and bring your chin toward your chest. That's what a neck curl is. Now remember, this is your neck that we're talking about. So take it easy. Make sure that these are slow controlled exercises, that your technique is perfect. and then as you get more comfortable, you can gradually increase the number of sets and the number of reps. And if you do this for a few months, you're gonna see a big difference. You're working out all those, there's a lot of muscles around your neck. And if you're wondering how much of an impact a thick neck makes, look at these photos and ask yourself, which one looks better? Now, when you combine having a strong, masculine neck with all these other eight hacks that I've just given you, you will have a much more attractive face. But I know these take time. So if you want something quick, I have seven hacks right here that will help you glow up in only 24 hours. You should definitely watch it."

        "transcript": " For the past 10 years, I've completely changed my life by pretty much obsessing over looks maxing. And not only that, I did it in Los Angeles, the world's looks maxing capital. And living there for so long and meeting so many guys, I saw both extremes. From the guys who would never do anything to improve themselves, the ones who were just complacent, to the ones who would lose themselves in LA and go a little bit crazy with this cosmetic surgery craziness and fillers and even bone smashing. And it's wild because when I first started on this journey of improving my looks, I couldn't even speak to other guys about it. weren't YouTubers giving advice on looks maxing. The word looks maxing didn't even exist. And honestly, it was a crazy journey. I've met some weird people in LA that really tried their best to take me down the wrong path. So I want to give you the full story. I want to tell you if it was all worth it. And I want to show you how looks maxing, if done right, can change your life. But first, I need to tell you about the crazy day that basically started this all. When I was younger, like the majority of guys, I didn't really care about my looks. I didn't care at all. But in seventh grade I left military school which meant that I could change my hairstyle because in military school I had to have a bus cut so one morning before I you know went to school I remember I bought this like huge tub of gel at CVS and I put some gel into my hair and I just put it into spikes I just wanted to try something new I think I saw it in one of those popular boy bands like at the time It was like n-sync or backstreet boys to be honest there was no reason behind it I was just bored but as soon as I walked into school it was like I was someone else suddenly girls kept coming up to me asking me about my hair and complimenting me. And because my family had moved from Brazil to the US, I was having a hard time adjusting to this new school, new language, and whole new country. It wasn't easy. So I was this quiet kid at school, you know, I barely had any friends, and I had this really heavy Brazilian accent, and I got bullied for it. And that's what kids do, right? I was far from the jock, the attractive bad boy, or the popular guy going to all the parties and talking to all the girls. That wasn't even close to part of my life. As a matter of fact, I spent most of my time playing video games. I used to rollerblade a lot too during the summer. I was kind of good at it, but that was like my only thing. I was kind of a nerd. So I would just study a good amount and try to get good grades. Just to set the tone here, my mom worked in my school's cafeteria. So she would serve lunch to me and the other students. And my dad was a dishwasher at a restaurant working crazy hours. They worked really, really hard to support me and I have two younger brothers. So I would feel too guilty to ask them to to buy me the popular trendy clothes that the other kids were wearing to school. So we would buy our clothes secondhand at yard sales, or sometimes I'd find a good sale at TJ Maxx and Marshalls, and I'd beg my mom to buy me a new hoodie or something like that, but I actually felt really bad doing that. So when I put up my hair in these spikes, it was the first time that I had ever experienced attention like that. I was used to being invisible to the girls that I liked, and honestly, I remember just being overwhelmed and kind of shy that day, but anytime girls asked me about my hair, I would puff up my chest and be like, yeah, you know, this hair, this is the new me. And honestly, I wasn't lying because it was that day that the light bulb went off. I realized that I could do something to change how I was perceived by others. I could stand out, attract girls, and get the respect from guys. That was a really crazy out of this world discovery to me. And what you need to know is that life is unfair because look, for example, a study by OKCupid found that women see 80% of men as unattractive or below average. 80% of men, that's insane. That means only 20% of guys are getting 100% of the attention. That's frustrating. That's demotivating, right? That statistic is horrible for men, but this is where most guys go wrong. They think that just because they aren't born a good looking Chad, they don't have any hope. They basically give up, they don't even put in any effort, and this fixed mindset, this is so dangerous because they never see their true potential. Looking back now, I can see how impactful that day was for me. Because if I had never tried something different, if I had never gone to school that day with that hair, I could have become that same guy, complacent. You know, the guy who thinks it's all over, who lost all hope. And I would have never realized that it was possible for me, this Brazilian immigrant with a heavy accent and no money, it was possible for me to get attention from attractive girls. Now, what frustrates me is that we now know that around 40% of men have body image issues. And this number keeps going up. And society fails them. Instead of telling these guys to sign up to a gym, spend time learning how to look after yourselves, improve your social skills, that doesn't happen. Society feeds your lies. On one side, they're telling you that everything will be okay. All you have to do is be yourself and you're going to date attractive girls. They will find you. That's total BS. And then on the other side, you have these black pillars telling them all hope is lost. You have no chance unless you're a Chad, unless you're a nine or 10 and filled with money. And luckily, even though I was part of the invisible 80%, I hadn't really been infected with this way of thinking. So as soon as I got home from school that day, I decided that I would do whatever it took to figure this out, to find ways to look cool and to no longer be invisible. And it's funny, back then, I wasn't really trying to level up my looks. It was just, honestly, it was just a way for me to fit in. I just wanted to have friends. I just wanted to be cool. So that became my hairstyle for a long time. And a couple of months later, I would see these athletes playing sports at school and and I noticed that they were pretty fit and girls were commenting on how fit they were. Now, these guys, they didn't even have to try. They immediately got respect, they stood out, and even though my hair was looking pretty good, pretty different, I wasn't as fit as these guys. I knew I had to figure that out next. So it's kind of crazy because as soon as I got my first job, which was making pizzas at Domino's Pizza, by the way, glorious, I saved up for almost two years and I bought two things that would honestly change my life. First was my car. It was a green 1995 VW Jetta. This was my baby, all right? It was standard, I loved that thing. And second was a Planet Fitness membership. I think Planet Fitness was like $20 a month at a time. And you know, for me, that was all I could afford and I was there pretty much every single day. I had no clue what I was doing, but I was just excited to be able to work out. So I would go there, I would work out, I'd come home and try to figure out how to keep working out, to gain weight, to gain mass. Within six months, I went from being this really skinny 135 pound kid to about 10 pounds heavier with abs still, which was really cool for me, being naturally scrawny, like I remember chugging weight gainers. I remember eating over 3,000 calories a day and it was disgusting. But seeing the constant improvement kept me going. And the more I saw my body change, everything changed. I got this feeling of freedom. I actually felt like a man for the first time ever. Lifting became a habit and I continued doing it throughout high school, but after I graduated, that's when I took it to the next level. I researched a lot more. I tried a bunch of routines, diets, exercises, but most of them, especially at the time, There were just like bro science. They didn't really work, but I was dedicated. You know, I would work out a lot and I saw small improvements and they were gradually happening. So by my early twenties, I wasn't this like scrawny guy anymore. I felt pretty good about my body. Not only did I look better, but I felt stronger. My posture improved and I was pretty confident in myself. In fact, there's a scientific evidence that backs up exactly how I felt that time. And I didn't know this back then, but now I know from this research, the European Journal of Social Psychology found that people with upright posture have more self-belief. It leads them to have more self-confidence and better self-esteem. Another study also reveals that connection between posture and mental health, which is nuts, right? They found that having an upright posture can trigger positive feelings and memories. It can lead to less anxiety, less stress, less depression. I really think that going to the gym and upgrading my body exposed me to this really positive feedback loop because my mental toughness, It really grew, making my insecurities slowly disappear. And I was getting noticed 10 times more and I started dating the girls that I used to think were way out of my league. The funny thing is, I wasn't just attracting girls my age either. I had older girls approaching me at the time and that was insane to me. And trust me, I'm not saying this to brag because I didn't even know what I was doing back then. I'm just saying this to show you what you're capable of. Unlike society will tell you, putting in the work instead of settling got me to this position. Within a year, I had changed so much that my friends now saw me in a completely different light and they would actually constantly come up to me and ask me, yo Alex, what did you do to change your body? What are you doing with your hair? What kind of supplements do you take? And that was validation for me. Looking back now, it all makes sense why they were asking me these questions, right? Because back then, they had nowhere else to go. YouTube was still in its early days. I remember watching my very first YouTube video in high school. No style or fitness gurus back then. No one was sharing good, accurate information. It was just cat videos and whatever. So I was spending hours reading these Jim Bro posts on forums like bodybuilding.com or whatever. Then I'd try things out and see if it worked. And because of this lack of information, I remember feeling lost at the time. There was nobody to help me. No guides, no community, no like-minded guys to connect with. It was just me alone trying to figure things out, trying to look good so that I could go on dates with attractive girls or look good at work or school and get the recognition that I wanted and be a part of cool friend groups. That's really all I wanted. But getting good information was pretty much impossible and because of that, it overcomplicated things and it took forever for me to actually level up. I didn't know what to do with the gym, I didn't know what to do with my hair, I didn't even do any skincare so I definitely did not know what to do with my skin. It also forced me to learn a lot though and it led me to kind of pursue. I was curious, I wanted more and it led me to where I am today. But now I want to give back to you guys. I want to make sure that you don't spend so long to go through your looks maxing journey alone. I spent the last few months building something truly special for you and I'm excited to reveal it today for the first time. It's called Men's Image Lab. And Men's Image Lab is a free community built with one goal, to speed up your looks maxing journey so that you can unlock what I like to call and what I kind of recently figured out, the attractive male advantage. This project is really close to my heart. It means a lot to me, so I put together literally a whole team to make this happen. It was a ton of work and like I said, I'm giving it all to you for free. I wanted to create a safe space for men to work on themselves. Inside the community, we have courses on every area of looks maxing, videos that are exclusive to this community and will never be posted on YouTube.

The thing is, because it's free, I do need to keep it exclusive so that members get the attention and the support they deserve. You can't go from zero to 20,000 members.

I was working out pretty hard. I was feeling pretty good and seeing a lot of progress. I felt really good about how I looked. I looked pretty good for a 19 year old. But something happened that year that I haven't really talked about online. And it was a pretty, pretty sh**ty year to be honest with you. And honestly, I kind of tried to forget it. My family and I were having issues with our visa. Basically our application to get a green card and stay in the US got denied. And the US government gave us 60 days to leave the country. I mean, think about that. We had to stop our lives, I had to quit college, quit my jobs, I had two or three jobs at the time. And just like that, we had to leave the US and go back to Brazil. I reapplied for my green card and had to wait for it in Brazil for almost two full years. That crushed me, it crushed my family. And we know how the story ends now, spoiler alert. I got my green card, came back to the US, it's all good. But at the time, I didn't know. I didn't know if they were gonna give me my documents. I didn't know if I was gonna be able to come back to the US. To me, I thought maybe I'm gonna have to live in Brazil permanently and never come back to the US. What do I do with my friends? What do I do with my life? My college? How does that work? It was... I was down bad. I didn't know what to do with my life. I stopped working out. I let my hair grow like crazy. I was eating like shit. I had worked so hard to build a strong mindset, a strong body. I was so dedicated, so disciplined. And then it felt like it was all for nothing. My gains, my confidence, they were all gone out the window. And it wasn't until I got my documents and came back to the US that I felt ready to pick things back up again and started to rebuild my life. I moved to Los Angeles, started working on myself. I got a new haircut, the slick back undercut, which at the time was really hot, right? Because of Brad Pitt's hair in the movie Fury. It, yeah, it looks horrible now, but at the time it was cool. And that hairstyle, it's funny because it gave me so much confidence. It reminded me that I still had some unused potential. It reminded me of that day in school when I spiked my hair up. You know, it reminded me that wait, there's still a lot for me to learn. I still have some gas in the tank to push forward and keep improving myself. I grew out my hair. I started posting that process on YouTube and it got some, actually got my first viral video ever, I think was a hair video when I was doing that top knot, which again looks horrible now, don't judge me, but back in the day it was cool. That's when I realized that for us guys, our hair is like girls makeup and it's crazy to say this but it's so true. But those different hairstyles that I had and improving my hair, it really made me feel like I was born again. It broke me out of that rut. It made me feel a lot more confident. I got back in the gym, I became more productive and that positive feedback loop slowly returned and as a result, now I had way more energy which I invested into this channel. That day I experienced what's called grooming confidence. And psychologists from the University of Queensland actually discovered it in a study where 81% of men said that they feel better after getting a haircut or putting in the effort to care for themselves. Because you see feeling sorry for myself in Brazil, it kept me trapped. I was stuck in this negative feedback loop that I couldn't even see. I was so pessimistic. I had these constant negative thoughts. It was a self-destructive cycle. And if you've ever gone through this, or maybe you're going through it now, I just want to tell To break free, you just need to act. Not just write your goals or write a to-do list to make you feel good, you need to shake yourself. You need to get out of the house and you need to immediately improve yourself. You have to ignore that pessimism, those negative thoughts and get back to growing. Remember that you still have gas in the tank and you have not reached your full potential yet. The changes that I saw from switching up my hairstyle and getting a new haircut, that started my passion. That's kind of what ignited it. and it blew my mind how much a new hairstyle could completely change your face and level up your attractiveness and go from invisible to all of a sudden, lots of attention and being attractive to these hot girls that I had no idea would be into me. So just like lifting, I also wanted to optimize that. So throughout my 20s, I literally experimented with a ton of different hairstyles and you've seen a lot of them here on YouTube. I've had it all, you know, undercuts, top knots, fades. I grew my beard out, I gave myself a buzz cut, Some looks worked, others, probably not so much. But the main thing was that I was trying things out. It's important to experiment with your hair and your facial hair because you need to go through trial and error to figure out what works for you specifically. And I guarantee that once you figure out your hair and find hairstyles that enhance your looks, you will be a new man. It's like having a superpower that you never even used. And because I had this YouTube channel, I started learning a lot about men's self-image, right? I first learned everything that I could about men's hair, then everything I could about skincare, then I was on to the next thing and the next thing that I needed to improve on. And it's kind of funny because as a guy, especially now 35, no one taught me anything about skincare back then. You know, I was the oldest of my siblings, my dad didn't do any skincare, so I couldn't learn anything from them. Having skincare routines and using products, that wasn't a part of my dad's generation. So I had to learn the basics at first. I had zero clue where to start to improve my face. So all I knew was like, I knew I needed to wash my face somehow and brush my teeth and that's kind of it. And being in LA didn't help either. You know, I was surrounded by these really good looking models, you know, these guys, the top 10% of looks, they knew how to dress well, they looked cool, they acted so cool, so I really doubled down on my research because either I did that or I was gonna feel sorry for myself and just feel low. In statistics report that only 37% of men practice skincare daily, that's not a lot. And back then I can guarantee it was way less than that, Maybe 15% of men did skincare, but I slowly figured out how to make it a daily habit. For example, here's one of my first ever skincare videos. It actually, I remember this video because it felt really good to know what I was talking about after all that research I had to do. But as I mentioned, Libby and LA, it really pushed me to look max further. Not only did people look good, but they always dressed well and they looked so confident. And this really opened up my eyes to the effort that you should go to if you want to look your best. Scientists found that people who were well groomed and perceived as attractive, they earned 20% more than their unattractive colleagues. That's crazy. And I saw a lot of well groomed guys in LA. I saw a lot of guys with different styles, different trends, but they all worked well and it matched that person wearing them. Very different styles, maybe some stuff that I wouldn't wear, but it worked for them. And honestly, that inspired me a lot. So just like I did with my hair and my skincare, I decided to experiment with different styles. And let's be honest, according to Instagram, there's photographic evidence that I got it all wrong. You know, I thought wearing skinny jeans with ripped knees and just horrible style, really bad. Also flashy brands, designer logos, I thought that was the way to go. You know, as soon as I made a little bit of money, I'm like, maybe I can buy some designer stuff. But honestly, I quickly realized that that was tacky and it attracted the wrong type of people. It was a complete waste of money, so I stopped. And as time passed and I learned more, I switched those really ugly trends and designer pieces for high quality basics, things that I could layer together, and I learned a lot more about fashion and style. I still made mistakes and still do to this day, but I always would think, how can I improve my style? How can I change my style but not go too crazy? Where is that fine line? And through constantly making mistakes, getting called out, asking questions to my stylish LA friends, I would slowly, slowly learn. And I gradually understood how to match my outfits, how to wear the right sunglasses, the right accessories, colors for my complexion, or what brands to get to fit my body type. Then I took the time to experiment. I literally tried everything. I practiced layering different clothes and using texture and colors to make outfits pop. I bought shoes for different occasions and I just kept learning more and more. Again, it's that curiosity that really kept me going. And even though I was just developing my personal style, I had a good hairstyle, I was in good shape, there was another change that I needed to make that just literally took my sex appeal to another level. And throughout my 20s, I became more comfortable on camera. I also, I switched from gaming, I began posting more of my self-development journey, looks maxing findings, and the years of sacrifice, the years of staying disciplined and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, they paid off. I was working at Google at the time, I was making six figures, I was doing well, I was happy with what I was doing. A lot was going on in my life and it was going on for the better. Like things were going well. You know, my channel began to take off. There weren't a lot of YouTubers giving men's, you know, self image advice back then. It was just me and like Alpha M and Jose from teaching men's fashion and Anthony DeLuca, Drey Drexler, Jordan O'Brien. These were like the OGs. We were kind of like the Avengers of men style but like, you know, the wish version of the Avengers. But we were the first ones to ever do it. So there was a lot of demand for that kind of content. Also, I started posting better photos. Like I elevated my photos for sure on Facebook and on Instagram. And I was really surprised and excited when brands and sponsors started reaching out to me. And I realized that, you know what? I could definitely turn this into a full-time career. Let's push this forward. That was absolutely crazy to me, by the way. Back then, this just wasn't a thing. I used to be a scrawny teenager too. I had no idea what I was doing. I knew nothing about style, routines, or how to look attractive, but many years later, here I was being paid to model, to take photos for my socials. It was mind-boggling to me. I was getting way more attention, and I noticed that life kind of got easier for me for some reason. I was beginning to unlock what I call the attractive male advantage that I told you earlier. So this is when it hit me that there is a male pretty privilege, it exists. And if you've looks maxed long enough, or if somehow you were born looking like a chat already, good for you, you're gonna experience it, you're gonna feel it. So I started getting invites to these events and these parties, and things were just starting for me, just looking up, going to these parties, they made me realize how much I had to take looks maxing to another level, because now I'm literally with the 1%. And it also made me see that there were wrong ways and wrong paths for me to take. There were dangerous to this journey, let's call it. Models, celebrities, actresses, other influencers, they filled these parties and it was like being in a room with others who had dedicated their lives to looking good, to being in front of a camera, to being very well spoken. And I thought I was doing okay, but honestly, in those environments, I really felt like the most average guy ever again. But one quick thing that I wanna say is that it's okay. You know, these parties also taught me that you need to balance your Lix Maxing journey because the pressure to compare yourself, to constantly look better than everyone else and to feel like you're not good enough, it does a lot of damage. And I saw that at these parties. Behind these perfect smiles, they were honestly vulnerable people. They had spent thousands of dollars getting risky surgeries, giant plants and whatever. Some of them even tried bone smashing to change their face shape. I've heard so many crazy stories living in LA for so long. It's wild. The most looks, Max and Guru's never really talk about how dangerous it can be without guidance. And the Mental Health Foundation did a survey. They found that nearly three in 10 adult men aged 18 and up, they felt anxious about their body image. And additionally, 11% have had thoughts about taking their own lives. Think about that. And one in 20 guys have actually hurt themselves as a result. Guys, like this, they need guidance. You know, they're clearly putting in the effort, but they also need to know that looks maxing isn't only, it's not only about looks. I saw so much in LA that it really changed me. You know, you maybe realize that, sure, you don't want to put in zero effort and stay average and invisible clearly. You know, that's what I've been doing my entire life is literally improving myself. One percent better every day is what I say. But also, improving your looks, you can't lose yourself on the other side. The problem is when you never feel like it's enough. When you just keep pushing because the reality is, there's always gonna be a better looking guy. There's always gonna be a stronger guy, a taller guy, guy with more money, a younger guy with more energy, and that's okay. But continue to improve yourself until you reach your full potential. So without in mind, you know, of course I wanted to improve my style. So I asked my female friends, I researched what women found attractive in guys, and after a while I realized that being attractive and having sex appeal, they're not the same. When it comes to your looks, being sexy, having that sex appeal, it pushes you further up the scale. For example, a lot of women are attracted to guys who have an athletic build over being skinny or overweight or too jacked. And this is because lean muscle shows that you're strong but you can still move quickly. And honestly, these were important traits that a man would use to survive and protect others back in the day, right? So women prioritize men with those traits. And we see it to this day, but during my looks maxing journey, there were two other things that I added that also elevated my sex appeal, that I literally noticed it immediately. And one of them is so simple. When I was talking to girls back then, they said that they liked guys who wore jewelry because they would always comment on either I was wearing a watch or something like that. And I'd be like, okay, well, let me try a ring. Well, let me try a bracelet. And they would say, oh, I like that, that's stylish. Guys with jewelry always have more confidence. Girls love it so much. I think it's because it's been a part of their lives for so long as opposed to us guys. We, you know, I'm wearing one ring, I barely wear any jewelry besides this. We all know that confidence is pretty much kryptonite to women. And I think it's the reason why Tinder has actually revealed that most men who use photos with jewelry on their Tinder profile, they get 73% more right swipes. And even this TikTok poll shows that 60% of women prefer guys with jewelry. So I've definitely tried it all when it comes to jewelry. That was one point I had earrings and still have the scars from it. Still have the holes, probably can't put an earring there, but I definitely have tried, I've tried a lot of rings and a lot of different things, but I always come back to now what I call the rule of three, which is I only wear three pieces of jewelry at any time. That's it. So I'll do a watch, a ring, and a necklace, max. Today, I'm not even wearing a necklace because I don't need it. It's not gonna show. Three pieces of jewelry, max at all times. That's the rule. The second thing I learned that women really liked on guys was tattoos. I know it's not for everyone. I get it, completely understand. But I decided, why not? I've always wanted to get a tattoo. And a few years later, I was in LA and I was like, you know what, I'm gonna get my first tattoo. And this is my first tattoo here. It says Made in Brazil, it's kind of dumb, but I really like it. It has a lot of meaning to me outside of just being from Brazil. And I got it done in LA, Inc. And I immediately fell in love with getting tattooed. I really liked it. And I wanted more, but I wanted to kind of make sure that I did it right, you know? And if you've been following my journey on Instagram, I got a lot of tattoos recently. And man, I'm so, so happy with how they look. Honestly, I think they're just such a part of my personality, a part of who I am, and every tattoo that I've gotten has history, has a story, has a meaning. It's not something that I just get for aesthetic or for, you know, to look cool or whatever. It's just something that actually means a lot to me. That's the only reason why I would ever put it into my body. But besides all of these changes, tattoo, hair, physique, posture, skincare, there was one thing that really completely changed my life. And that was because back then, When I started my journey, I was shy. I was kind of clueless. You know, I felt invisible. I was invisible. And I spent hours researching, hours in my bedroom, testing different things and testing different hairstyles and researching skincare routines. But the truth is, making these videos, this is really what changed everything for me. When I first started making videos on YouTube, they were in Portuguese, because I'm Brazilian, I speak Portuguese, and I had a Brazilian audience. And I decided, why not change it? I wanna make it in English. I wanna challenge myself. I've never done this before and I spoke English, but it was tough, man. It was so difficult starting at videos in English and it completely changed my confidence levels. It made me a much better speaker. I became way more eloquent. I became way more comfortable in front of a camera, way more comfortable talking to people and making friends. Why? Because I could do it here. Every single day I'm talking to the camera. Every single day I'm coming up with new ideas. every single day I'm sharing something. I'm still curious to this day. This channel has helped me grow so much into the man that I am today. And I'm so glad that a lot of you saw this entire growth, saw my entire journey here on YouTube. And it's been, it was life changing for me. It still is. Sometimes I still pinch myself and yeah, it's this real. And sometimes I'm still not sure. Here we are today. the fact that I was able to build a career out of improving myself and then kind of helping other guys do the same for themselves, I'm just so grateful for all of that. I'm grateful for you. And if you've been a long time subscriber, if you've been with me for this journey, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. And if you just followed me today, if this is your first video ever that you're watching for my channel, thank you for watching. I appreciate it. There was a lot of personal information there. So hopefully you got the gist. Hopefully you get to know me a little bit better now. And if you're in your 20s, if you're young, and if you're just going through this self-development, this looks maxing journey now, be patient. That's my one advice to you. Do what you can, but be patient and understand that you should only try to get to your true potential. You don't have to compare yourself to anyone else, just compare yourself to who you were a week ago, a month ago. That's it, and I promise you, your life will change. And remember to join the Men's Image Lab community that just launched today. you get your spot locked in, it's that first link in the description below."

        "transcript": " Everyone always says that men are visual creatures, but they're forgetting that women are too just not in the way that you would think And there's this whole chatter online right now about the female gaze Well, I'm gonna reveal six secret ways to hack that female gaze from changes to your hair your outfit and even your height And they take less than 10 minutes to do and you don't need to be a tall jacked model because each of these hacks will bring Immediate and noticeable results for any average guy and yes, I use these myself daily These hacks are gonna give you an unfair advantage. One of them even increases your dating app matches by 73%. But before we get into them, you have to understand what the female gaze is and what it's not. I remember back in school, I was feeling kind of bored and uninspired and I decided to switch up my hair. I don't know what got into me, but I grabbed a big tub of gel from like CVS and I put my hair in spikes that morning before going into class. And as soon as I walked into class, girls looked at me and asked questions about what I did to my hair. It's not like there were negative questions. The girls gave me compliments. They were very interested because no other guy at school was doing that. So I quickly realized that my new hairstyle, it set me apart. It made me look more confident. It made me look more cool. And it's funny because just a few months later, a couple of other guys started to copy that hairstyle because they saw that power that it gave me. And they wanted that for themselves. And I didn't know it then, but I stumbled upon a hack that attracts that female gaze. And by doing that, I found something that acted basically like a switch. I could turn women's attention and attraction to me from on to off just by changing something in my appearance, whether it was my hair or outfit or anything. Now if you go online and you search for the female gaze, there are so many over complicated definitions. So I'm going to keep it simple. The female gaze is about what women actually find attractive, not what men think that women want. You know how some guys think that flexing muscles or flashy and nice watch will get girls' attentions? we call the male gaze. Literally this is the opposite. It's what women want but in reality that's not always true. A lot of times girls might feel actually turned off by that behavior, even intimidated by that kind of behavior. And this is something that I only figured out after I bought my first really nice watch. I bought a Rolex Submariner to celebrate my million subscribers on YouTube and I paid like $10,000 for it right? And I thought for sure women would notice. And to my surprise 99% of women didn't even know the difference between a $200 watch or my $10,000 Rolex. Only guys would come up to me and ask me, you know, what kind of Rolex is that? When did you buy it? Do you have any other watches? I was literally attracting the male gaze. That's crazy. Now studies also show that girls are actually into guys who embrace traits that many people mistake to be feminine, like keeping up with your grooming, caring about your style, and having emotional and social awareness. Girls love a mixture of those traits and they're attracted to your health, to your energy, and of course your masculinity. But listen, you need to know that not all girls like a square jawed billionaire or an MMA muscle head, right? Sure, those traits are cool and they can be attracted to women, but obsessing over them because some 18 year old inexperienced looks maxing TikToker made a video about it is just a waste of time. And wasting time is exactly what we want to avoid. That's why the first hack is to focus on your hair. I mean, social psychology research literally shows that certain hairstyles can shape first impressions. Which is not a surprise at all. These reveal that guys with a well-groomed hairstyle come off as more confident, more attractive. And a clean cut hairstyle is a sign of health, good hygiene, and even an eye for detail. It makes you seem more socially presentable, it makes you look more desirable. But how do you pick a hairstyle that of course attracts that female gaze but still feels like you? Like you're not trying too hard, you're not trying to show off. And here's where you get tactical. You want to hop onto Pinterest because most Pinterest users are women, 76% to be exact. That's a high number. So Pinterest isn't just for recipes or DIY projects. It's a gold mine to see what captures that female attention. So first, brainstorm what makes you unique. You know, maybe it's your hair type, the texture, maybe it's your face shape, your hair length. Next, pull up interest, search something like men's hairstyle with, right? And then you add men's hairstyle with your unique features, different textures, curls, waves, whatever. You're going to be amazed at how many hairstyles pop up that could elevate your look and attract women instead of trying to chase them instead. This is a game changer. It flips the whole script and I've used this hack so many times. I've changed my hairstyle so many times just to get that attention, just to change it up and get that female gaze. And you know what? It always works. And you've seen it here on YouTube how many times I've tried different hairstyles and it always works. Trust me. But look, styling your hair, it's not the only hack that we're going to talk about today. There's one specific type of outfit that really gets girls' attention. When you think of a high level man or the CEO of a massive company, you probably visualize him wearing a specific outfit. And I'm guessing it's a suit. That's because suits have been a symbol of masculinity and strength for as long as I can remember. The only issue with suits is that they can get expensive. Well, not these. These are affordable suits that you can get from Koo Fandi. They sponsor today's video so I could show you their collection of fun and affordable suits, which are perfect for the wedding season that's coming ahead. And look, I've promoted other pieces from Koo Fandi before like their polos, which I still wear all the time like this one here. But it's cool because if you're not really into suits yet and you want to dip your your toes in, this is an easy and affordable way to do it. You have different styles, different colorways, different fits, and on top of the crazy prices, they actually let me give you a 30% off coupon if you use my code, alex03. So when I say they're affordable, I really mean it. And by the way, none of these suits are tailored. These are all off the rack. And for reference, I'm 5'9\", 170 pounds, and I'm wearing a size medium. So check out the first link below to get 30% off your order. If you ever notice how some guys walk into a room and they immediately command attention, right? It's as if they've got this like invisible force around them, it's like magic, but really it's actually science. Because research shows that your posture communicates what kind of man you are. And it shows women that you're confident, that you're dominant, or you're weak and submissive, right? Today we spend a lot of time hunched over our phones, hunched over our computers. This is a big issue. I've had this issue myself. I've had to really work on my posture. And the majority of guys never even realized the unattractive impression that their posture giving off. They're walking around slouching, rounding their shoulders, keeping their heads down, and you're actually going to miss chances to stand out and to connect with attractive women because they'll immediately read your body language. They're going to look at your posture and they're not going to like it. It's going to cost you some points. Now, before you start thinking, great, you know, just another thing to stress over. Breathe because fixing your posture, it's actually not as tough as it sounds. I've had to do it. There's an easy hack that changes the game and you can do it right at home. It's super easy so let me help you. Before you head out next time, try this. Stand with your back against the wall, heels, butt, shoulders, head all touching the wall. Then slide your hands up and down like you're making snow angels and this is called a wall angel exercise. It's a quick way to just reset your posture. It trains you to stand tall, it trains you to stand confident and you just got to do this maybe once a day. Of course there's a bunch of other exercises that you should do as well for permanent changes to your posture like face pulls, and working out properly. But look, I need to say this because I've been seeing guys trying really hard and it comes off wrong and I just got to get this out. You don't want to be standing so straight that you look stiff as a board, right? Imagine a fighter doing their entrance walk, but dally down a little bit. You don't have to go crazy, right? Bring that intensity back by like 20 or 30%. But when you look at them, they look alert, they look ready, they look focused, but still smooth. They They look cool and that's the confident energy that you want, but still chill and approachable. You don't want to look like you're about to fight someone. It's just a walk. Now there's another female gaze hack that gives you 73% more attention from women when it's paired with good posture. And no, you don't need to be this male model to do it. There are two ways to dress that will hack the female gaze and immediately get her attention. And the first one is actually an easy clothing hack. Just changing this outfit slightly. It plays into women's primal instincts. So the same way that men can't help, but to be attracted to women with that hourglass shape, it goes both ways. Except for women, it's all about men with a V shape. And research actually shows that a high shoulder to waist ratio screams strength, fertility, top genes. The ideal ratio is about 1.6 to one. It's actually what people think is the most attractive build worldwide for men. But look, even if you don't have big shoulders and a slim waist, you can still get a V shape look with the right clothes. go for fitted shirts that emphasize your shoulders and that are tight around your waist or tops that make your shoulders look broader. Basically get anything that highlights that V shape. It's literally the reason why we made these T-shirts from ATOS with a V taper line on the sides because those lines, the seam, it accentuates that V shape and it gives you an actual line. You can see it and it comes forward. So these T-shirts are made to make you look more muscular and we even have new colors now too, which is exciting. So I'm gonna leave a link to all of the colors and all of our T-shirts in the description below because when you're wearing them, it immediately enhances that B-shaped look that you wanna go for. Now for the second style, there's a word that will completely change your approach. I don't know if you've ever heard of the word peacocking, but you know how peacocks flash their colorful feathers, right, they grab the females attention? Well, in our world, honestly, it's kind of the same. Peacocking is when you spice up your look with something that pops so that you stand out. And listen to this, research shows that women find men who wear jewelry more attractive. An attender experiment found that men wearing jewelry got 73% more matches than if they don't wear jewelry. But there's a fine line between looking good or looking like a clown with a bunch of accessories, right? So to keep this hack simple, I like to follow what I call the rule of three. I don't wear more than three pieces of jewelry at once ever. For example, a nice watch, a ring, and a necklace. That is enough. Just don't go crazy. But if you do want to go a little above and beyond, if you wanna hack that female gaze with peacocking, you can even try something a little crazier, like getting a fake tattoo or something like that. Just don't rely on these fake styles too much. Treat them as something fun, something bold to try on once in a while and just to start a conversation with someone. The number nowadays, I'm below six feet as well, so I share your pain. It might still be difficult to stand out. This is why this next hack, it flips everything and it brings you to a whole new level, literally. And look, it's no secret that right now, height is one of the most attractive things that you can have as a man, right? It's one of those just really attractive advantages for a man and it just shows leadership, it shows confidence, it shows strength, I understand. And as a result, it's a magnet for attraction. And dating apps can be brutal with their whole height filters, right? A couple of inches more, you're suddenly in the game, but just because you're not, you know, towering over six feet, it doesn't mean that you're out of luck. Look, there's a way that shorter guys can still access this hack. So what do you do? Well, for starters, of course, get nice shoes that enhance your height, right? A good pair of boots will give you a little boost. And if you don't want to wear boots, try heel inserts, for example, like just slip them into your shoes and watch yourself stand taller. And look, you can say, oh, what? Am I gonna wear high heels? Oh, this is trying too hard. It doesn't matter. And look, yeah, you might get some shit, but honestly, no one's even gonna tell. No one's even gonna be able to see that you're wearing those inserts, or that you're wearing boots, so that you look a little bit taller. The truth is, what actually matters is that you need to feel confident, and you need to get that attention. And then once you get that attention, your personality, your charisma, your storytelling, right, the way that you carry yourself, those are the things that will stick around. So does it matter that you're actually 5'8\", your 5'10 with the right shoes? Not really. This next hack is something that most men tend to overlook, or I should say over here, but it's about the sounds that come out of your mouth because those are just as important. And this study blew me away. Scientists discovered that women not only find men with deep voices more attractive and more powerful, but they also remember what these men said better. They tend to forget what men with high-pitched voices said quicker. That is some crazy sh**. But hey, not all of us hit the jackpot, right, with the Morgan Freeman voice. So what's the work around? What do we do? This actually is, it's gonna be a little weird. Bear with me for a second, but there's this quick two minute exercise that you can try and it works, right? So after you try it, please leave a comment below and let us all know how it went. So start by closing your mouth and keeping it shut. Now you're gonna hold your nose to prevent any air from coming out and you make a low humming sound, almost like a groaning sound, very low for about one to two seconds. And as you do this, your throat and your mouth will expand and you're gonna feel a little pressure. Once you can't continue humming, breathe out the air in your mouth and take a deep breath in. And you're gonna repeat this 10 times. So what is it? The basic is gonna sound a little bit like this. You do it 10 times. This trains your vocal cords to maintain a lower pitch, but make sure that you're not overdoing this exercise. One round is enough to notice your voice getting deeper for that day. Also, make sure that you're breathing deeply into your stomach and drink water, not just when you're talking, but all day, because staying relaxed, staying hydrated, Those are the secrets to a deeper, richer tone voice. But there's one final change that might be the most important. In fact, this hack can actually have more impact on the female gaze than everything that I've talked about so far. If you've ever walked past someone and found yourself taking a second look, not because of their appearance, but because of their smell. I do this all the time. You guys know that I love fragrances, so it's no secret that a scent can be a powerful trigger. In fact, scientists have found that our sense of smell is closely linked to memory and emotion. And you know this, right? because sometimes you wear a fragrance when you're younger and then you stop wearing it and then you wear it again a couple of years later and it reminds you of that chapter of your life. It literally transports you back. It's like a time machine and it activates that memory. And smell triggers those memories even more than some of our other senses. And here's the crazy thing. Studies actually show that a man's smell can actually a lot of times be more attractive than his looks. That's why your fragrance could be basically the deciding factor in hacking that female attraction or not. But let's talk about the elephant in the room here. Some of you might think, how is a single cologne gonna take me from an average guy to a 10 out of 10? And look, I don't want you to think about it that way, because yes, if you look homeless or crazy, but smell amazing, women aren't gonna be all over you, right? They're not gonna wanna connect with you. Your scent, it's like the finishing touch, the cherry on top, you know, and the previous hacks that I mentioned, just like adding the right tie, your shoes, or pocket square to your outfit. So how can you find your perfect fragrance? Well, you start by finding scents that get great responses from women, that you get those compliments, right? And men, again, they can actually wrongly view sense. They can actually give you that male gaze instead of the female gaze. A lot of these manly, leathery fragrances that are really powerful, women tend to not like them as much. These scents can be a little overwhelming, overbearing, they can smell generic sometimes, and they don't really get the women's attention. So to save your time, these are some of my top recommendations, and these have been tried and tested, and trust me, they have the stamp of approval from the female gaze. For younger guys, I highly recommend abracame be fierce. It's not going to break the bank. It smells amazing and it's a really great versatile fragrance. Then you've got Aquadigio Perfumo. It's masculine, girls love it. You can wear it to the office, you can wear it on a date. I absolutely love that fragrance and it's also really versatile. We have Versace DeLinblue, a really nice warm weather fragrance. Even Versace Heroes, which became kind of this meme and people make fun of it, but it's a really good fragrance and women love Versace Heroes for whatever reason. These fragrances, alongside the other five hacks, these are your ways of pushing the female gaze button. And if you implement all of these changes, you're gonna hit all of those buttons so many times that it'll be impossible for her to ignore you. But now that you've got her attention, what do you need to do next? You need to watch this video right here to find out."

        "transcript": " The majority of young men don't own or wear suits anymore and this is happening for many reasons like changes in our society, work culture and technology. And some men even say they don't wear suits because they're uncomfortable, they're stuffy, they're impractical. A lot of men also work from home now with no in-person meetings so there's no need to own a suit. In general, men's style has become a lot more casual now especially here in the United States. I mean if you think about it we spent so much time at home over the past few years that fashion became more about about comfort and practicality instead of a symbol of self-expression, status or class. Some men think that wearing suits is a thing of the past and that it makes them look old or it makes them look like they're trying too hard. There's also a price factor, right? T-shirt and jeans, it's a lot cheaper than suits. So why wear suits? Especially around summer, which is right around the corner. You're trying to stay cool, you're trying to stay comfortable. But here's what they're missing. Wearing a suit, especially in the summer, isn't about conforming to old traditions and looking really formal. It's really about embracing a style that shows confidence, a style sense, and strength. So hear me out because if you're one of those guys, I'm about to change your mind and show you why you should absolutely own nice suits. Look when you dress well, you're not just wearing clothes, you're wearing an attitude. And research shows that our style significantly impacts our self-esteem, our mood, and even our attitude towards the world. For example, wearing a suit can make you feel more powerful, more confident, and a casual outfit is going to make you feel more relaxed, more sluggish. And this is a clear sign that your choice of outfit changes your mindset and essentially changes how your day will play out because in a suit you might feel more productive, you act like a leader. Funny enough, and this is something that I noticed when I wear a suit myself, it will even change your posture and how you move. It makes you move with purpose, you feel like the best version of yourself. And since when did putting effort into how you look, since when did that become a bad thing? In an ocean of casual clothing, a suit stands out. People will literally treat you differently when you wear a suit. It's about feeling as good as you look and you're about to look really, really good in a suit. But that brings us to the question. What kind of suit should you buy? Well, today, I want to guide you to your perfect suit in five easy steps, and I guarantee by the end of this video, you will know exactly how to suit up this summer to look your absolute best and feel confident in that suit. And the first step is that you need to know the reason why you want to suit in the first place. You see, so many guys just think, I need a suit because I don't have one. So I'm just going to get a black suit because I've heard somewhere that's the most versatile color for suits, and that is wrong. As a matter of fact, I'd say this whole get a black suit thing is outdated now. And in a minute, I'll tell you why I would never buy a black suit first. All right, so before you head over to Suit Supply and you start looking for a suit, think of what you wanted to say about you. Do you want it to show your serious, more mature side? Then you should go with a darker color, classic shapes. Or maybe you want something more casual and fun, which by the way, you can be casual and fun wearing a suit. Just go for a tan or lighter blue, for example. The best thing you can do is let your stylist know the exact reason why you're getting a suit. Our sponsor Suit Supply has incredible stylists who can help you. And when I say incredible, I really mean it. They know their stuff. So ask them as many questions as possible. Learn from them and they will guide you to the suit that will fit you perfectly. I went to their Soho location here in New York City to get this suit, which is my newest one. And they have a massive space with a ton of options. And I recommend going in because they have a lot of inspiration there. So you walk in, you immediately see the different color palettes. You can touch and feel the different fabrics. And you can even pull inspiration from the mannequin that they style. or even the stylists themselves because all of them are dressed really well. But even if you just go to their website right now, you see all of their new summer suits. And one thing I wanna confess is that I take inspiration from their photos all the time. Their photos are the best out of any suit brand out there. No one comes close. The styling, the art direction, it's all perfect. And I use those images in my videos all the time to showcase great outfits. So thank you, Suit Supply, not just for sponsoring today's video, but also for giving me so many great photos and style inspiration. So now that you've established why you want a suit, it's time to decide what you should look for when buying a suit. This is the best part, the most fun, because the more you learn about suits, the more interesting and exciting they become. You can choose the fabric, the type of lapel, the shape of the pocket, the number of buttons on the sleeve, the inner lining of the jacket, and it might sound daunting, right, or overwhelming, but it's really not. It makes the process a lot more fun and personal. And when it comes to picking out the right suit for you, you have to start by choosing the right fabric and lining. Think of the fabric as the foundation of any great suit. And it's not just about aesthetics or how it looks. Different fabrics actually have different benefits. Silk, for example, is more sheen, it's lightweight, so it's comfortable in the warm weather, but typically not as durable as wool, which tends to retain the shape, it keeps you warmer in the winter. Linen is highly breathable. It's known for its really cool area texture, and it tends to wrinkle a little bit more than the other fabrics, so be careful with that. Cotton, for example, is versatile enough to wear year round, but not as durable at some of the other fabrics. Now for summer suiting, I highly recommend these fabrics. Pure linen, pure cotton, or wool blends like this beautiful wool silk linen blend right here. These are perfect for warmer weather because they're breathable, they're lightweight, and they look great. And to see all these different types of fabrics to choose from, just head over to Suit Supplies Custom Made Configurator, which is linked below. And you can filter by season, so you get all the right fabric options for warmer weather. Right now you can see they have 107 different spring in summer fabrics for you to choose from. So really, there's just no way that you won't find something that you love. Mine is 100% linen, and that's because I got this for a wedding that I have coming up in Egypt, and I wanted it to be breathable and comfortable. I used the custom-made configurator to customize this entire suit, and to make it perfect for this warm weather wedding. Now, when it comes to the lining, you really have four options. Fully lined, which means the entire interior of the suit jacket is lined with fabric. Half lined, which means the upper half is lined around the shoulders and the chest and arms. Butterfly lining which covers only the upper back or unlined which only has lining in the sleeves and nowhere else. And I chose unlined for this suit because I wanted it to be as breathable as possible. I'm gonna be outside, I'll be in the sun, right? It's gonna be very hot in Egypt. And keeping this unlined, it just makes it lightweight, it makes it breathable, it's the perfect warm weather suit. But if you want your jacket to be more structured, if you're not gonna wear it in a really hot place, then you should go for one of the other options. For example, I have this other suit that I got from Suit Supply last year And this one has half lining. So you can see that it's still lightweight, but it's also more structured than the one that I'm wearing right now. Something you have to keep in mind when you're choosing the right suit is the fit. And it might be the most important part of the whole process. Now, you can have the most expensive suit in the world, but if it doesn't fit you well, it doesn't matter because it just won't look good. So you have to decide what kind of fit you want. And that is step three. And it varies from person to person. Some guys like a traditional classic fit, which gives them more room for movement. It's a more mature fit, it's not baggy. It's just a little looser around your body. You can go for a more modern fit too, which is less roomy, has more of a narrow lapel and tapered trousers. Personally, this is my favorite fit because it hugs my body well without being tight. And look, in my opinion, I just have to get this out there and save some of you from doing this because tight suits, they're just a no-go. If I had to recommend a type of fit, I would say this is it, a modern fit. It's stylish, but it's not overly trendy. I can wear this suit for years. no matter what direction fashion trends go, whether they move to a really slim or a loose trend, this will always be a really nice in between. If you like it when your suits hug your body, you could go for a slim fit, it works well. If you have a lean physique, for example, or if you wanna show that athletic build, but like I said, if I were you, I would choose something with a little bit more room to spare. To me, slim fit suits are just a little uncomfortable and not as timeless like the other two cuts. Also, keep in mind that choosing the right fit totally depends on your body type. your personal style, and of course, it depends on the occasion. You might want something more traditional for every day at the office, but something more fashion forward for a wedding in Mexico with your buddies. And honestly, the most important part of the fit isn't even choosing between traditional, modern, or slim. When you get a suit, you need to have an eye for detail. You need to know where your sleeves should end and how long your jacket should be. I'm gonna tell you exactly what I like to ask for when I get my suits, but this is just what I like. And I think the best thing that you can do is going to suit supply, try on the suit, See how it fits when you move around, right? Move around in it, walk around, sit down wearing the suit, and those guys over at Suitsupply, they're great at making sure that everything fits you perfectly, and that type of advice is priceless, right? Because these guys are professionals, and they know everything about suits, so you're getting expert advice as you're trying on the suits. In general, this is what I ask for. I like my sleeves to be just at the break of my wrist. If I'm getting the sleeves shortened by them, so if I need to do some tailoring, if I'm spending that money anyway, I get them to make my left sleeve a half an inch shorter so that it doesn't bunch up on my watch, which I always wear a watch with a suit so it makes sense for me personally. The shoulder seam should be at the very end of your shoulder. If it's on top of your shoulder, it's too tight. And if it's sitting low on your shoulder, then it's too baggy. I like my jackets to come down just slightly below my wrist, about a half an inch below my wrist. That's a little shorter than most guys like their jackets. I do that because it makes my legs look longer. It works from my body type. So when you're getting your suit pinned up, just ask them, hey, can we go a little shorter? Can we go a little longer on the sleeve? Can we hem the trousers just to touch? These are all personal choices and each of these choices will make your suit unique to you. And to me, this is the best part of the whole process, right? Because all of a sudden it goes from a standard suit to uniquely your own. And I think that's the best part of getting a new suit. It's the most fun. It's not just tailoring for your features. It's tailoring to enhance your features. So if you have broad shoulders, you can make your suit highlight those shoulders. If you have short legs, you can tailor your suits to counterbalance that. So spend some time understanding what you want your suits to highlight when you're wearing it. But there's another thing that also makes a huge difference in the way that you look wearing that suit. And it's the color or pattern of that suit. And it's funny because suits have this unwritten rule about colors and it's that darker colors, they tend to be more professional and more serious, right? And then the lighter colors, they can be seen as more casual for daytime. So basically if you're going to your office job on a Monday and you have a big meeting that day, wearing a tan suit, it'll be perceived as more casual than a darker suit. And I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, it's just important that you know so that you can pick the right suit for the right occasion. Solid colors, especially darker shades like navy or dark gray, they have a nice slimming effect, making you look more slender, making you look even taller. They're also really versatile, so you can wear them for basically any occasion, and they're easy to accessorize. Any accessory that you have will probably mix and match with your suit. But I don't think the old saying that you should get a black suit as your first suit applies in today's world. You can actually end up looking too stuffy in a black suit. I think it almost looks like you work at the event instead of being a guest at the event. So if you want a darker suit, you should go for a solid navy. You can go for a dark gray. If you want a fun pattern, you can definitely go for that, like pinstripes, herringbone, windowpane, plaid, checks. There's a lot to choose from and all of them have these nuances, right, that show your body in different ways. like the vertical lines can make you look slimmer and taller, for example. And each pattern behaves differently. So typically I'd say go for a solid color as your first couple of suits, but at some point you're gonna wanna have fun, right? You're gonna wanna get something that's a little bit more bold. And honestly, summer is the best time for that. It's your chance to break away from the cold, boring winter, and to throw on something that's more vibrant, something that's more fun and outgoing. I'm a huge fan of earth tones and pastels, so I'm really happy with this suit because honestly it's just more fun. And by the way, you can and absolutely should try different color shirts or polos with your suits because it changes the entire look and the vibe of the outfit. And suit supply has a lot of polos to choose from. I just got a few from them that you can wear with or of course without a suit. But there's one final step that makes your suit your own. That makes it even more fun and more you. And when you get this right, it's the cherry on top. It brings it all together. Accessories are the final touches that can turn a good suit into a great suit. Think pocket squares, different ties, sunglasses, a watch, the right socks, the right shoes. A suit without accessories just, it just doesn't look complete. I wear a pocket square most of the time I wear a suit because it adds some personality to my outfit. And lately I've been pretty much exclusively wearing loafers with my suits. This black leather loafer from Suitsupply is beautiful. They have this new suede loafer too that I absolutely love. I just had to pick it up. I mean, look at them, they're perfect. And when you combine these five steps, your opinion on suits will change and you will feel incredible wearing your new suit. So head over to the first link in the description of this video to create your own custom summer suit with suit supply and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " You know when you're standing in front of your closet feeling like you have a bunch of clothes but nothing to wear. We've all been there, right? So my goal with this video is to make sure that doesn't happen for you this season. Because look, the solution isn't dropping a ton of money for a few new trendy pieces and hoping that that will fix the problem. Today, I'm giving you the ultimate guide to spring style. No more guessing games, no more outdated looks. I want you to look back at this video later and remember this moment as the moment your style truly evolved to the next level. and I'm only going to be happy with this video if you accomplish that. So let me get to work and we'll start with tops. And as always, all the links to the items that I'm showing today will be in the description below. Specifically, I want to start with polos and, you know, forget about all those preconceived notions that come with polos because they used to be seen as boring, right? They used to be seen as stuffy, but with the new styles you can get today, that's not the case anymore. Today's polos are modern, they're versatile, and honestly, anything but boring. Just look at this poll that I'm wearing right now. It's not really what comes to mind when you think of polos, right? You can get sweater polos, which are my current favorites. I really like this one here from Suitsupply. Very high quality. It's classy. I also like this pleated polo. It's from Abercrombie and it's affordable. Of course, the next level up would be from Issey Miyake, but that's going to cost a lot of money and I think it's overkill. You can even get crochet polos now. Mine is from King in Tuckfield. I got it on sale from Essence before my trip to Dubai and honestly, I love it. It's a little oversized, which makes it casual, it makes it more fun to wear, and I always get compliments when I wear it. Suit supply also has their version. It's not as relaxed of a fit as this one, so it's versatile, it's the perfect spring polo. Now, when you're choosing the right polo, just remember that there are different types to pick from. You can go with a button down, a spread collar, or even a contrast collar. You should also go for a long sleeve polo for those colder spring nights. I love this green one from Asimo Dutti. I also like this one here from Koss. And the beauty of these polos is that you can literally wear them with anything. We can pair them with Taylor Chinos for a smart casual look or denim for something more laid back. Now onto tees. Every man should have a variety of t-shirts. If you want something more relaxed and boxy, you can't go wrong with the unique low tees. And if you want more of a muscle fit, then you know that ATOS makes the perfect muscle tee that will last you forever. They're great for a more tailored look. I also recommend you grab a couple of graphic tees. I don't wear these a lot, but they do come in handy when you want to throw on an easy outfit to run errands. Abercrombie has a ton of options, and so does Asos, and they tend to be pretty affordable. And the next item that I'd recommend for the perfect spring wardrobe is a camp collar shirt. And you can get them with a fun pattern for a casual spring vibe or a solid color. These are all from Atos. Moving on to lightweight jackets. Now you really only need two. First, a lightweight workwear jacket. I got this one from Abercrombie, I love it. It's slightly cropped, so it makes my proportions look really good. And it's a nice layering piece. It doesn't make you overheat, but it adds a nice stylish touch to your look. I also recommend a casual bomber jacket. They're easier to style. They have more of that street style vibe. And you can wear them with a tee or even a hoodie underneath. A shirt that you keep coming back to in spring and summer is a linen shirt. Now I have them in all different colors. They're breathable, they're classy. You can dress them up or down. They're versatile, which is important, right? When you're buying new pieces for your wardrobe, you want to keep versatility in mind. Otherwise, you'll spend all your money on something and you won't even wear it a lot, which means it's probably not worth your money. Linen shirts are worth your money. The best layering piece that you can get this spring is a white ribbed tank top. I like wearing a tank because it lets me open up my shirts, get some airflow in those hot days, or I can button the shirt up and stay warm if it's colder outside. Plus it looks a lot more interesting than wearing a shirt without it. Moving on to pants you'll need this spring and we're gonna start with light wash denim. You can wear them with a t-shirt, a camp collar shirt, bomber jacket, I could go on for days. The point is, they're versatile. They should last for a while. And most importantly, they should fit you well. I recommend getting straight or tapered, because if they're light wash and they're tight on you, it's gonna look bad. I'm telling you right now, do not go too tight or you will regret it. I've also been wearing these pleated pants so much lately. I'm so glad I got them. They're from Isamiaki, but you can find dupes out there for more affordable brands. I like them because you can dress them up or down. I love them so much, I actually got them in black as well. They're lightweight, they're breezy, so you can wear them even in those hot summer days. I also recommend a pair of linen pants, especially if you're gonna be outside for a while. Linen, if you don't know, is one of the most breathable fabrics that you can find. So these are gonna keep you cool without the need to wear shorts, which I know can be hard to style sometimes. I know you're gonna question me on this one, but believe me when I say that you should definitely get some white or cream trousers. Most guys are scared of wearing white trousers for some reason, but that just goes to show that if you wear them, you're gonna stand out. And you can go with something classy from Suit Supply or even denim as long as you're not too heavy. And if you wanna start with something lighter but not all the way white, you can go with a light gray, for example, and feel it out. I highly recommend you go with trousers that have that off-centered waistband closure for a really nice clean look. And they're a lot easier to style than most guys think. You can wear them with tees, polos, jackets. Just trust me on this one. I've been doing this for a long time, like a really long time. Let's go over the best shoes and accessories for spring, but before that, let me just say that helping men like yourself unlock their full potential is my purpose. I want you to look your absolute best and not in a superficial way. I actually want you to look your best so you can look in the mirror or look at a photo that somebody took of you and feel good about it, feel confident. Confidence creates momentum, which leads to growth. And that's the goal here. And if I've helped you grow in any way, hit that subscribe button, hit that like button, which really helps me grow and reach more guys who would benefit from these videos. Moving on to footwear. I highly recommend you get a pair of clean sneakers with a classy aesthetic like these from Arnie. Now these are amazing. I've been wearing these a lot lately. So many people ask me where I got them from. And you know what? I don't gate keep the YouTube family. All right. I'm linking everything in the description of this video. New Balance also has a ton of stylish sneakers, like the 550s, which are great in all white, for example, I'm sure you've seen this before because they're really hot right now. Or the 90s, 60s, which are more sporty, they're trendy. I see a lot of men and women wearing these. You can never go wrong with the tried and true classics that will never let you down. The Chuck 70 Plus, for example, they're very versatile. They can take a beating. You can wear them daily if you want to. And I like them because they have that platform sole. So for my short Kings out there, these will give you that extra height boost, which is always nice. I'm not gonna lie, I used to hate on loafers. They just didn't do it for me. Like I was just never into them until maybe last year, I decided to give them a proper shot. And I'm all in now. Like I love wearing loafers and if you haven't tried wearing them, this is what I'm gonna say. Think of an outfit that you want to wear that would look good with loafers. Then get a pair of loafers that would look good with that outfit. and I recommend something versatile, easy to style, like these black loafers from Cole Hawn or these suede ones from Suit Supply. I'm telling you, it just elevates your look, especially when the majority of men wear sneakers, right? Or maybe they even wear these leather shoes that, let's be honest, they're just not it. These are maybe for a boring office or a suit. They'll stand out a lot more. Again, I want you to leave this video feeling ready to step out of your comfort zone and to finally have that style that you've been craving and that you deserve. Don't just watch this video, you have to give these pieces a chance. That's the whole point. Now, there's a big mistake that most guys make in the warmer months of spring and summer. And this mistake makes you look way less stylish than you should. It's a missed opportunity and it happens for one reason. It's because when it's cold outside, you can layer up. Your outfit looks complete. Now, there's a lot of cool details in your outfit. There's different pieces working together, like a tee underneath the hoodie. It's under a bomber jacket. You have denim, you have sneakers. There's a lot of character, a lot to play with here. When it's warm, the last thing you want to do is wear a T-shirt and jeans or a polo and chinos because that is boring. That's why you need accessories. They complete the look without accessories. Your warm day outfits just don't look as good. That's why it's a missed opportunity. You don't need a ton of accessories. I actually recommend you follow the rule of three, which states that you should never wear more than three pieces of jewelry or accessories at once. For example, one watch, one necklace, one ring, That's enough. There's no need to go overboard. Or actually, you end up looking like a try-hard. Do you know that I love my necklaces from Pira? They're a great quality. They have a lot of meaning, which is a great conversation starter. When it comes to rings, check out Surge The Neem. Their prices are accessible. They have a ton of styles. And the majority of my rings are from them. As for watches, you know that we can go deep right now. They go anywhere from 20 bucks, all the way to literally millions of dollars for one watch. So let's keep it simple. I'm going to recommend two different styles. First, something more casual, something that you can wear daily. Get a stainless steel diver watch. I'm going to give you three price tiers to make it very easy for you. First, the affordable Casio. It's a reputable brand. This watch is actually water resistant, up to 200 meters, and it's less than $70 right now. Next, this beautiful tutor. It's automatic, it's versatile. I love the white dial, and it goes for about $1,750, so a big step up. And if you're really into watches and you want something that will last you forever, something that you can pass down to your kids. Of course, a Rolex Submariner, which is a classic. It's one of the most popular luxury watches in the history of watches. And it goes for about 10 to $15,000, depending on the watch market. As much as I love the stainless steel watches, I've been wearing the crap out of my leather band watches. Like I love this Cartier Tank Louis, where there's all the time, it's pricey, but I do have a great alternative for you guys. And it looks so similar that it's actually hard to tell them apart if you're not into watches. Of course, the Seiko quartz white dial is less than $150 as opposed to 12 grand for the Cartier. It's the perfect watch for guys who want to look more stylish or guys who like that old money aesthetic. There's one thing that will bring all of this together. The last thing that you put on before you leave your place to go out and something that is incredibly important if you want people to remember you. A great spring fragrance makes all the difference and you should definitely go for something like the Forte series fragrance. Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to, can you cut this out, editor? You should go for something fresh, something that embodies that fun spring vibe that we all look forward to every year. I really like Coach Green, Valentino born in Roma, Creed Green Irish Tweed, Prada Luna Rosa Ocean, or Chanel Allure Omsport or Extreme. You're gonna smell amazing wearing any of these and you can find all of the links for everything in the description below. I'll see you next time."

        "transcript": " I'm about to uncover the dark side of Lux Maxing. And Lux Maxing means maxing out your looks so that you look your absolute best. Now, if you're a guy who's excited to glow up and start your Lux Maxing journey, be careful because this journey has a lot of traps. There's a lot of misinformation everywhere. And without guidance, you can end up lost, overwhelmed and even isolated. This happened to me. So after uploading hundreds of Lux Maxing videos, it's time I expose the five ways that it can actually ruin your life. but I'll also share how to avoid each of these traps so that you can have your glow up safely, you can feel better, and finally unlock your full potential. The first trap kinda crept up on me. There was a time when I was so caught up with looking perfect that I wouldn't even leave my place unless everything was on point. I had over complicated skincare, hair care, and workout routines. My hair had to be perfect. My skin free of any pimples, and I had to wear the best outfit that didn't hide my gains. And maybe you get what I mean. all of this content about looks maxing, it makes it easy to chase those impossible standards. In fact, a 2022 survey about body image showed that nearly 40% of men are insecure about their looks and 85% of men don't think they're muscly enough. This obsession got to the point that it was stopping me from living my life. It paralyzed me. I couldn't be spontaneous. I couldn't live in the present moment. And as a result, I missed out on opportunities all because I was worried about my appearance. Maybe I wasn't wearing the right outfit or whatever, So I would just say no and not meet up with my friends, right? In being honest here, I also felt this pressure of having to look good all the time because it's literally what I talk about in my content. So when I go out, it's very common that guys who watch my content come up to me to chat, take a photo, and I'm all for that. I love that. But I felt like I had to look perfect all the time. Now I get that this might sound too intense to happen to you, but that's exactly why you need to be careful. The deeper you dive into this Lux Maxing rabbit hole, the easier it is to be consumed. So it's important to keep an awareness of this trap so that it doesn't creep in and catch up with you. And it took a while, but I finally realized what's the point of improving my looks if I'm not going out, if I'm not socializing and enjoying my life. Life is too short to stress about being perfect, right? So to regain balance and control and to avoid this first looks maxing trap, stop overthinking. Focus on improving one pillar of your looks. Maybe it's your hair or just your skin or just your fashion, whatever you want. You just need to keep things simple. Don't go overboard. If you're not seeing perfect progress, it's not all over. Take a balanced, slow approach if you want to. That's fine. It still gets you girls, it still gets you respect from guys and a better life, so enjoy the journey. There's no rush. And I know that obviously you wanna keep leveling up, but keep it on a healthy level because the truth is perfection doesn't allow you to move forward. On the flip side of that, what if you're frustrated and see no results, right? You're seeing no progress and you feel like maybe your genetics are holding you back. Look, I know these are tough, frustrating thoughts, but they're actually another looks maxing trap. You see, psychologists have found that people who often compare themselves to others, they create this self-fulfilling prophecy because it's easy to look at guys who seem like they have it all and think that your genes are holding you back. You will never be as tall. You will never have as strong of a jawline or the bright body proportions or whatever it is. It's not about that. Listen, I get it. If you're not born looking like a Brad Pitt 10, then what's the point, right? You might feel like, you're just never gonna achieve that and that heaviness that's gonna weigh you down. But here's the thing, you don't want to fall for the trap of aiming to become someone you're not or reaching some unattainable standard. What you need to do is transform into your version of a tent. How you use comparison can either inspire you to take action or it can just be an excuse to give up. So to avoid this second looks maxing trap, this is what you have to do. First, you have to list all of the areas that you want to change about yourself. Then split each point into two columns. One, the areas within your control, things that you can actually change. And then two, the areas outside of your control. These things, they cannot be controlled by you. These areas outside of your control, they're things that you have to stop comparing yourself to or even thinking about it honestly because it just wastes time. And maybe you've heard of that height increasing surgery that's out now. It turns out that some guys are paying a hundred to $200,000 for it. It's not covered through insurance. Look, I'm five nine. All right, and sure, I would love to be six foot tall. There's just no way that I'm gonna break my legs, have metal rods inserted and be in bed for months just to grow three inches taller. Don't fall for that looks maxing trap of taking things too far. You need to know that right now you might be at your version of a five or six. So stop dreaming about becoming some famous celebrity or a random chat on Instagram who's got all the genetic gifts. Instead, focus on what is required for you to get to your version of a 10. Take Bruno Mars for example, he's five foot five. That's the bottom 10% of men's height in the US. So by looks, maxing standards, he shouldn't be attractive. But if you ask girls, the majority are gonna tell you, he's got it going on. Why? Because he's focused on what he can control. He improved his looks, his style, his charisma, his career, his artistry, and his mentality. So yeah, he doesn't have that height, but he's massively talented. He stands out, he radiates confidence. He's got an incredible smile. Glamour magazine literally rated him one of the sexiest men alive. He's 5'5\". And look, if the younger, unsuccessful version of him constantly compared and thought that there was no hope, where would he be? You see, I love it when people reach their potential. Over the years, I've seen so many guys like you surprise themselves when they realize how much of a transformation they're capable of. So instead of focusing on the things that you can't control, shift your focus to the levers that you can still pull. This will break you free instead of breaking your legs and you can actually accelerate your transformation. But while you're glowing up, there's a third Lux Maxing trap that can sabotage your dating life. And before we even get there, I just want to say that as much as you might want to focus on leveling up your looks, you also need to elevate your mind. You should absolutely be working on having the right mindset because that's what's going to allow you to achieve true growth. And as men, I don't know why, but it's almost taboo to talk about mental wellness. And I hope that if you're watching this video and you're on your Lux Maxing journey that you also take some time to to grow and expand your mind. I recommend you have high level conversations with someone you can trust. And our sponsor BetterHelp offers just that. Therapists that you can connect with. Because talking to your friends, it's great, right? It's fine. But what if you could talk to someone who's studied the human mind and does that for a living? That's a whole new level. And frankly, our friends just can't get to that level. And the best part is that you can say whatever you want. Anything that you're going through. Without the need to feel embarrassed or feel like you have to hold things back like you might do with your friends. Most guys just wanna keep these thoughts and emotions to themselves, but there's more power in sharing that with someone who can guide you through those moments. So instead of holding it all in because it might feel like a burden to go talk to your friends about something, that's the perfect time to have a conversation with a professional for better help. People seem to think, especially men, that therapy is for when something goes wrong. A difficult breakup, family situation, but the reality is that therapy will also guide you through good times and make you a better man because when you understand yourself, your mind, the reason why you behave or feel a certain way, then you become better and that's just the fact. And it's so easy. You just go to betterhelp.com slash alexcosta, you get matched with a professional with years of experience and you can do it all from your phone, your computer, you can do a video chat, you can do messaging or just a phone call. There's no need to go into a physical place which is not only convenient, but also means you have privacy. So head over to betterhelp.com slash alexcosta and get a special discount on your first month for being a subscriber here. Now, as you go through this glow up, the quantity and the quality of the girls that you attract will also increase, and that's one of the benefits, right? But if you're not careful, this can actually backfire. And I'll tell you a story. So during my teens and my 20s, when I was single, I thought about dating models all the time, right? That was like my ultimate goal. I'm like, I wanna date this gorgeous model. They seem to have it all. That's what I want. Looking back now, I didn't realize this, but I suffer from what psychologists call the halo effect. It's when one positive trait about someone outshines everything else. It kind of blinds you and causes you to have basically unrealistic assumptions about them. So naturally, when dating, I would go for models, right? That was my type. They had to be 10s. I would be excited to see how things would go with them, but a lot of the dates were boring. There was zero compatibility. And that's when I realized something important. And I know this sounds like common sense, but sometimes you forget that just because someone is a 10 on the outside, it doesn't mean they're your perfect match. If you become obsessed with looks, you won't filter people the right way. And you actually attract girls that are also obsessed with looks. This is the perfect recipe for a shallow relationship. The best connections come from more than just the physical. So focus on finding someone who can vibe with you on a much deeper level. That way you'll attract women who are not only beautiful, of course, go for your type, but also have that personality and that character to match. But honestly, I think this is just a lesson that you have to go through. You have to experience for yourself because I remember how amazing the feeling was when I had my glow up, and I went from being invisible, being ignored by all these women, to suddenly having abundance, right? So much that I could pick and choose from, and most were 100% my type. So I thought I had it all figured out. So I get it if you go a bit overboard, but just make sure that you don't limit yourself just because of looks. You don't wanna be 40, married with kids, and realize that you've built a life with the wrong person. This next trap, in my opinion, is one of the most heartbreaking effects that Lux Maxing is having on young guys today. This generation is one of the loneliest. You can look that up. You can look at reports from the American Psychological Association, for example, that says that over 36% of American adults feel serious loneliness. In fact, young adults aged 18 to 35, which is the majority of my audience, they report the highest levels of loneliness. Guys are constantly online and they go down these deep rabbit holes And he makes them develop these unrealistic views of what actually brings happiness to their lives. One example is this massive wave of male body dysmorphia. A study last year found that 54% of men showed symptoms. And guess what? It was higher than women's. Women's is at 49%. That's wild. It's so easy to compare ourselves to models, to bodybuilders and the top 1%. So as men, you know, we've tied our self-worth to these impossible standards. Who do you see on social media? Is it the average guy with a dad bod going to work every day? Or is it the Chad with all the muscles, all the girls, all the money? But the thing is, that's just not how the majority of men live. It really resulted in guys feeling as if they have no choice but to make crazy decisions to level up their looks. They take things too far and go through risky, irreversible surgeries like breaking their legs and having metal rods put in them. Personally, I highly recommend staying clear of those types of surgeries. They're risky and honestly they prey on your insecurities and of course they prey on your wallet. So putting this video together, it actually made me realize how important it is to have a safe space to discuss your self image that's not toxic. When I was in high school and college, I needed a place where I could get advice. I always wished that I could connect with cool guys also working to reach their full potential. And back then there was no YouTube, right? I'm kind of old. There was no guides, no help. I knew there were benefits for being attractive. I knew I wanted to glow up. I just really didn't know how to until much later in my life. I wanted to unlock the advantages that being an attractive man gives you and we know there are advantages. And because of that, I'm working on something special, something some of you already know. It's an exclusive community that I'm building with the main goal to give you a place to connect with me and a place to connect with other guys who are also on this journey. The journey of unlocking your attractive male advantage. So stay tuned for more. But it's this final trap that made me realize what looks maxing can and cannot give you. Your looks maxing journey is meant to be enjoyable, not an isolating and painful experience. The whole reason you, me, or anyone else got into looks maxing is to look better. And in improving our looks, we expect life to get better, right? But unfortunately, the truth isn't that simple. And it's actually a common misconception that fame and success brings happiness. We always hear about these models, right? Models, actors, celebrities who despite their seemingly perfect lives. They battle with depression, loneliness, unhealthy relationships. I'm telling you guys, yes, nailing that perfect look can and will open doors, turn heads, but thinking that it's the golden ticket to everything in life, including happiness, might lead you down a path of disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about maximizing your appearance. It's literally my job here, it's my purpose, and I will continue to do it, but to truly transform your life, you have to pair with some serious inner work. So make sure to invest into healthy habits. Spend time with your friends, with your family, with your loved ones. Spend time with your God if you're religious. These things, they just help keep you grounded. They help you not mix up your priorities. Lux Maxing gives you superpowers, right? But glowing up, without understanding these five traps, it's like having a superpower, but not knowing how to use it, or worse, using it to become a villain. Don't lose yourself and be overly critical, Because if you look great, but then you're insecure, you feel terrible, you feel isolated, what's the point? Take a minute to remember why you want this superpower in the first place. And it's to have a better life with more opportunities and more fulfillment. And now that you're ready for these superpowers, I have a glow up playlist right here, ready for you to unlock those superpowers."

        "transcript": " Okay, picture this. You're at your local grocery store running errands. You head over to pay at the register and while you're waiting in line, you casually scan the place. There she is. A cute girl, just your type, locks eyes with you and to your surprise, she smiles. Maybe she's into you, but instead of stepping up, you hesitate. You don't know what to do or say, so she goes about her day and you missed your shot. And honestly, it amazes me how many opportunities are lost because guys don't know how to react in those situations. Once you realize how easy it is to turn that smile into something more, you probably laugh at your old self and how nervous you got for no reason. So let's tackle this. By the end of this video, I wanna give you six actionable steps that will turn her smile into something more because the last thing I want for you is to wonder, what if, what if I smiled back? What if I had the courage to approach her? So many guys think that acting like some cold alpha male makes them look cool and it's what girls want and no. That is not the approach that you should take. First impressions aren't only about what you say or see, but what you feel. You want her to feel good energy, a good vibe when she's talking to you. This is why it's so important to lead with positive and relaxed energy from the beginning. Something that guys forget is that girls are just as nervous about rejection and interaction with a new person as you are. So when that cute girl smiles at you, listen up man, ditch the weird overly serious look, give her a soft smile or a smile's back and see how she responds. This shows that you're friendly and open. That's why step number one is to reciprocate her smile. It's the quickest way to show her that you're genuine, positive, and approachable. But there's more. After the smile, pay attention to her behavior because it's the next reaction that counts. Does she immediately look away and then break that eye contact or does she maintain an open body language? Because unless she switches and shuts it down, it's likely she's just giving you what we call a choosing signal. This is something really important that will stop you from ever looking like a creep, which I'll explain in detail in step three. Okay, so you've caught eyes and she's still smiling. What now? This is when you start to feel the clocks ticking, right? You know, you need to act immediately. You need to do something. But one thing that you can't do is panic. You see, when a girl gives you a choosing signal, it's a subtle sign only made when she's interested. She wants you to approach her. You know, when you see those cringe videos of guys getting brutally rejected in public, most of the time it's because they approached without getting any signal from the girl. They approach too quickly and it comes off as aggressive. And look, I understand how scary going up to her can be, but the fact that she's already receptive is a great start. Those videos definitely don't help in easing that tension, but sorry, I have to say the worst thing that you can do right now is stall. Avoid making her assume that you're another unconfident guy who thinks that she's cute, but it's too scared to go up to her. You need to stand out. You need to leave a good impression. So here's the key step in your head, count down from three and as soon as you hit zero, ignore everything, no matter what, stride over there and break the ice. Now, I know this is probably the hardest part. Once you approach, you need to say something to open the conversation. What do you say? And there's no one size fits all answer. There's no magic pill. But what if I told you that the secret to being irresistibly attractive isn't what you need to do, but what you need to stop doing? Because you see, back in 2015, Australian psychologists ran a speed dating experiment and discovered something surprising about attractive masculine traits. After receiving a choosing signal, Most men try and respond in the perfect way. They try to act perfect, which leaves them to overthink and do too much when they're interacting with women. They're trying too hard. And can you guess the common trait that these psychologists found in the best interactions they saw in all of this experiment? Maybe a specific opener, a phrase, a certain topic. It's actually none of those. It's a lot more simple than you would believe. The best interactions came down to not what words were being said, but rather how they were being said. Think about the way you act around your friends, the way you're hanging out with them, you're communicating with them, having a good time. You're probably relaxed, you're probably playful, you're authentic, a little vulnerable sometimes. Well, that's the secret. These traits allow us to be truly present and feel connected, loosen up, stop trying so hard. Don't put the girl in a pedestal, she's a normal human being who you can treat just like a friend. So after counting down from three and walking over just like you would with a friend you haven't seen in awhile, open with a genuine compliment, a relevant question about your environment, maybe something around you, or a joke. To be honest, what you say doesn't even matter. The point is just show that you're relaxed, show that you're fully present, show you're a non-judgmental guy. And when mixed with confidence, girls find this incredibly attractive. Then all you have to do is keep the conversation going without making things awkward. You know, I remember when I was younger and I moved to the US from Brazil and I was pretty introverted, I was really shy. And in the rare moment that I would get noticed when I wasn't invisible to a good looking girl, I would still hesitate to talk to them. I was scared. I'm probably not cool enough. She's gonna judge my accent. You know, my English is not really good And as a result any time I try to talk to girls, I just felt awkward like I got awkward and obviously it went nowhere I had no game. I had no game I was overthinking everything and those failures made me more and more scared of talking to girls It made it worse, but one day everything changed I learned that it's all about the mirror the energy that I projected was usually the energy that the girl reflected. If I had negative thoughts and I tried approaching girls the conversation would turn out low energy, boring, because I was scared. I had no confidence and she could pick up on those cues. But if I was having a good day, if I woke up feeling good, I went to the gym, I was hanging out and having fun with my friends during the day, then I saw a beautiful girl. That same interaction would be upbeat and fun and carefree and relaxed. So I have a secret to tell you. After introducing yourself to the cute girl, remember human communication is It's 55% nonverbal, 38% tonal, and only 7% verbal. Your body language, eye contact, and even the conviction in your voice lay the foundations for how your interactions will go. Perfect words don't mean anything. If your confidence and your internal beliefs don't actually match. It's like going up with a girl with the perfect, funny pickup line, right? It's like you've been practicing this pickup line. You read about it somewhere. It looks really good. It sounds great. But then when you deliver it, you deliver it in a monotone, boring voice. Your facial expression doesn't change. The girl who initially smiled at you will pick up on those cues and it's gonna make things awkward. She's gonna think this is an awkward guy. That was that supposed to be funny? I'm not really sure what's happening here. Overthinking will 100% mess up your delivery because you're nervous and it's gonna show up externally through your posture, your stutters, or any other nonverbal cues. So remember to avoid looking weird or not confident. Don't be too hard on yourself before, during, or after the interaction. This isn't a test. Think of it as a fun opportunity to have a chat, to connect, to learn, and to improve your skills of talking to girls. But look, of course, as fun as connecting and talking and practicing can be, let's be real, you're probably hoping to take this to the next stage. So how do we make sure that we spark that attraction and stay away from getting friends-armed? Which might be the worst case scenario. Well, you're almost there. You notice her choosing signals, you approach her, You're now fully present, you're having a nice, relaxed conversation without feeling anxious, without feeling scared. The next big step, how do you spark genuine attraction? And funny enough, I learned this from Tony Robbins from all people, so it's about to get deep. It's called polarity, and it happens when you show your masculine side, which causes her to embrace her feminine side. This polarity creates a magnetic pull of attraction. It's what you feel when you're around someone who perfectly complements your personality. Being unable to predict how they will respond keeps you slightly on edge, and the interaction just becomes more mysterious, it becomes more exciting, it becomes more fun. This polarity is like a dance between the masculine and the feminine. It's the pull that you feel in a great conversation. She might make you laugh, or your reserved and stoic character attracts her in. You're both polarized by each other. But on the flip side, we have depolarization, which happens when neither of you embody any clear masculine or feminine traits. So you both act similar to one another, and it's not necessarily a deal breaker, But if you don't want that spark to fizzle out, if you don't wanna end up in the friend zone, you have to avoid this. Here's how to create this polarity. First, you need to show confidence. Simply approaching and initiating the conversation, you've already done this. Most girls respect a man who's secure enough to approach them and to take that risk, right? Because the majority of guys don't. They don't have the courage to go and talk to them. So when you've counted down from three to zero, then you approach, you're ahead. So let's get going. Second, at some point early in the conversation, make it clear that you find her attractive. If you're interested, you have to make it clear. And you can do that by flirting with her slightly, nothing aggressive. For example, you can say something like, stylish girl shopping for dinner ingredients, so you're probably a good cook. It seems too good to be true, what's the catch? Immediately she knows that you're interested in being more than friends, but you did it in a nice respectful way. And third, if she continues to be receptive with that relaxed and positive energy, ask her out, get her number, get her IG. Say something like, Emily, you're cute, you seem cool, I know you have to get going here, but how about we grab drinks or dinner? What's your number? These three techniques will create that polarity and let you immediately know if she's interested or not. Overall, when you showcase your confident, masculine energy, which is being clear on your intentions, taking action, not being afraid to lead and remaining present, you're gonna attract girls who have that feminine energy. The difference between getting stuck in the friend zone and having strong chemistry is immediately creating this polarity as soon as you meet. And just like that, you finally get her number, but there's one last hurdle. You have to leave with grace without making it awkward. No matter what you do, don't linger. A lot of guys linger around and then it gets awkward. Say goodbye, smile, tell her you're gonna send her a text. Psychologists have found that people strongly remember how you made them feel over what you've said, looked or even sounded like. So it's really important at the end of that interaction to leave on a positive note. Basically the goal here is to leave her with a smile. So when she thinks of you or when she tells her friends about you, she remembers that feeling, she remembers that smile. But make sure to watch out for red flags. I listed a bunch of these red flags that you should stay away from in this video right here. And of course, don't forget to subscribe. I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " A few weeks back I went to this club here in New York City and I see it from the corner of my eye. A girl approached me. I can see that she's looking at me, she's interested in asking me something. She comes up to me and she says, hey, I'm that guy from Raya. So she goes, you are, you're that stylish guy. You're wearing those really nice outfits on Raya and that's when it clicked for me that despite all of these other photos of me. Shirtless at the beach, traveling, nice cars, cool friends. Despite all of these photos that I posted on my dating app, She remembered the fact that I was stylish. That's what she remembered. That's what made me stand out. And it's wild to think about this because if you know Ryor, then you know that only the top 5% of men are there. All right, here's the thing. Even against them, having style, knowing how to dress, it caught her attention and it made me memorable. She came up to me. So when I say that having style is life changing, I really, really mean it. You see, bad style not only makes you invisible, But it also destroys possible connections with women who would have probably found you attractive in the first place, but you're not putting your best self forward. Let me tell you that with a few simple tweaks to your outfits, you will become irresistibly noticeable. In this video, I'm revealing some of the outfits that drive women to find you attractive, but not only that, this is your guide to psychological strategies that you can use to stand out without breaking the bank. And by the end of this video, I'm also going to share this one tip that guys use to skyrocket their matches by 73% on dating apps. And I'm also going to share the outfit that I am wearing on the photo that the girl commented about on my Raya profile. But first, had he ever wondered why some guys they just seem to effortlessly attract attention the moment they step into a group. By regardless of what they wear, well here's the thing, when a woman looks your way, one of the first thing that she notices is how your clothes fit your frame. And studies literally show that first impressions are formed just within seven seconds. And that clothing and style, it plays a massive role in that snap judgment, that snap decision for that first impression. So before you leave your house with the outfit that you have on, make sure you look in the mirror and just look at your pants and say, does this fit me? Does it look like a hand me down from someone that's two sizes larger? Because believe it or not, those first impressions can quickly slot you into the sexy, attractive, good looking handsome guy or just another face in the crowd. Basically invisible. That's a completely different category in her mind. Now you're probably asking Alex, what if I'm not rocking this runway model to Zeep right? Because then clothes are gonna fit me as well. Can the right style really elevate my game even if I'm not in the best shape? And here's the thing, it actually does make a huge difference. Look at this. This is my buddy Nick. Despite not being like the model mold, he absolutely crushes it with his style and he consistently turns heads no matter where he goes. Why? Because he unlocks the fastest way to elevate how women perceive you. And how can you also do this? Well by following a simple guide that I like to call the golden fit rule. So we need to go that extra mile and making sure that our clothes are clean, making sure they're ironed. Looking scruffy isn't the same as having rugged good looks. Not looking presentable is probably just going to turn it It's the same when it comes to the fit, right? Everything needs to fit you well. I get it, now we're in this era where outfits maybe fit you a little more relaxed, a little baggier, they don't have to hug your body perfectly. That's totally fine. But if your pants are stacking up on your shoes, right, creating all of those layers, if your pants are falling down because they're too big, you just look sloppy. I've been making fashion content for years on YouTube. And one thing that will never change is how important the fit is. No matter what the trend is, It needs to fit you well. And you're gonna be amazed at how quickly you become the guy that everyone can't stop looking at by just making sure that you nail the fit. And as important as the fit is in making sure that everything fits your body perfectly, fitting into her version of attractiveness and understanding who you're trying to attract is also really important. And let's get real here for a second because this is actually where a lot of guys trip up. They get carried away following these crazy trends and these niche outfits. It's a lot simpler than that. You don't have to go that crazy. to attract women. You need to know your audience, right? You need to choose, okay, what kind of women do I want to attract? And then you need to wear pieces that speak to that audience, to those women that you want to attract. Here's what you need to do. You need to take a minute and think about the women that you want to attract, all right? Think about what they look like, write down their traits on paper, are they gym girls, are they college girls, are they party girls, they're the girls, older women, I don't know what you're into. Doesn't really matter, but ask yourself, What are you into? What's their taste? What do they appreciate? Where do they go? Where are they right now? Most likely, gym girls, bull-like guys with bigger muscles are more defined or that are gym rats as well. Right, the show author, physique. College girls, maybe they want a guy who's more casual or older women, maybe they want handsome, younger guys who dress smart. Everyone's different, so maybe find them on Instagram or the dating apps that you're on and just see if they follow any mince-fashioned guys, any guys that are stylish. and then go onto those guys profiles and see what they're wearing. Basically, you're trying to see what guys this woman is attracted to. And now that you know what they're attracted to, then you start to mirror that. But make sure to do it in your own way. Don't change where you are fully just to attract a specific type of woman. All you have to do is slightly tweak your wardrobe, slightly adjust it to align with what catches their eye. But that's not all, there's a lot more for us to cover. For example, you need a standout item that makes a statement. And this is something that I've been talking about YouTube for a long time. You need something like a leather jacket, a signature watch, something that pops, something that's slightly different from what the average guy is wearing. This is where you get to show off a bit. It doesn't have to be anything expensive, it doesn't have to be anything desider or anything crazy. It just has to show off who you are, your personality. Tastefully of course, because you don't want to be that guy who looks like he's trying so hard. We all know that guy is trying so hard, everyone can tell that he's a try hard and for some reason it's not really attractive. There's a level of try hard that you need to achieve and you can't go past that where it just looks like you're just a try hard. So it's all about showing your wild, your bad boy side, you know, way that is still balanced. Showing your personality in a way that's balanced. Research actually shows that adding a unique element to your outfit and actually boost your attractiveness. And there's a nickname for this. If you guys have read the book, The Game, which is about, you know, basically talking to women and making sure that you look attractive. It's called peacocking, right? But obviously without the feathers, without the dance. So maybe you're thinking, Alex, I'm not about to rock some crazy neon suit. I get it. I don't want you to. That would be weird. What I want you to do is trust me, a well-chosen, statement piece. That's it. It's especially something that appeals to girls that are your type, now that you know what your talent is. That's your work wonders. And remember, it could be as simple as a nice jacket. It could be a ring. It could be a watch. It could be a necklace. Anything that changes the way that you're perceived because now all of a sudden you are no longer invisible You're creating your own spotlight by people are now going to look at you Maybe you have a watch that becomes a conversation starter an icebreaker Maybe the type of woman that you're attracted to likes men with longer hair and you let your hair grow a little bit longer I'm a big fan of simple outfits with a twist and that twist is what we call peacock It's just changing something slightly so that you don't look like another invisible generic guy I want you to be the face, the body, and the style that you can't forget. But here's the thing, getting your style to fit in with the girls that you like, that's just the first step. Instead of fitting in, what do you need to stand out to women? And the truth is, this is getting harder and harder. Why? Because in today's world, everyone is fighting for attention on social media in real life. What if this secret to be noticed was actually not tried? It's a common mistake that putting all of these high-end designer logos and flashy accessories, that that is the shortcut to impressing women. I guess it depends on the kind of woman that you like, but I know that the kind of woman that I like doesn't like that stuff. It's not into the crazy flashy designer things, alright? But here's the truth. Overdoing your outfit with these loud, crazy, attention-seeking pieces, it actually has usually the opposite effect. Attraction isn't about the brand names that you're flaunting or the price tags dangling from your wardrobe. Spending a lot of money and flashing brand names, that's not being styled. That's not how you show style. Instead of buying a designer and spending all that money and invest it, it's gonna be good for you in the future. Style isn't about who you're wearing. It's about how you're wearing. It's about the fit, the coordination, the effort that you put into every single outfit when you go out the door. And it's about how each item that you're wearing complements each other. Women actually usually, they're not really swayed by the number of designer labels that you're wearing, but how well each pieces come together in one outfit. And if you don't believe me, check this out. In a nationwide survey here in the US, they reported that 78% of women believe that the hottest thing that a man can do is dress well. 78%, that's the hottest thing a man can do is dress well. And 85% found a guy that dressed well to be sexier than one with a lot of money. Now that is crazy. Remember overall style, being stylish, having your personal style, beats brands every single time. That's why I made this video on broke men dress better because you just have to know how to put things together. You're not just throwing logos and thinking that you're stylish because you have a Gucci shirt on. That's not style. That's just you blowing money to show off. And I'm not lying, girls really go crazy over a man who looks like he's not trying. You know, it's what I call it is controlled chaos. You should do your hair. You should put on a nice outfit. You should make sure that you're lining up your beard But what you do is you then kind of tussle your ear make it look a little misci-er, you know Just don't look perfect. I swear it makes all the difference. They just go crazy over a man looks like he's not even trying Oh, he just jumps out of bed and he looks like that It shows that the guy has tastes but he speaks volumes way more than any logo even this outfit right now There are no logos. You don't know where these items are from. They could be a thousand dollars each It could be $15 each. That's why I'm pairing nice basics and plain shirt with classic pants. That's a great move. That's why I love the old money aesthetic is because you can look so good, so well put together without showing logos. And the best part is that it works in your favor. You don't have to spend money. You don't have to wear designer brands to look stylish. As a matter of fact, that makes it worse. So no logos is usually the way to go. Now the outfit might look a little basic at first, but by the end of this video, when every piece comes together, then women will see that you've got style without you needing to shout about it with all the LV logos and the Gucci stamp on your chest. And this is that subtle confidence that creates the mystery that women find irresistible. And by the way, if you're sitting there worried, sweating that you're gonna have to overhaul your entire wardrobe, lose your individuality, you know, you don't, relax. There's this common myth going around that to get women you need to reinvent yourself, your fashion, your style, you need to follow these really fashion-afford rules You don't. Alright, I'm here to tell you that that's definitely not the case. Attractive women isn't about changing into a disguise or a costume, right? It's actually just enhancing who you already are. You just have to find things that speak to you, but you do have to put effort. What I hate hearing nowadays is just be you, man. You should like who you are. It lets me real here. We all want to be seen. We all want to be appreciated by women. No one wants to be loamed. I'm assuming you don't, and that's why you clicked on this video. Well, I'm gonna give you a quick hack to find out what women find appealing and this works wonders All right start by considering your physical features think your body type your height your skin tone your hair color So on as a fourth they go with a Pinterest and search for attractive man with followed by your particular trait Let's say you have curly hair So you say attractive man with curly hair after you spend a few minutes researching you will find guys Who looks similar to you, but they've basically maxed out their style now all you have to do is literally try these different looks that these men have already created. Just copy the ones that are popular, the ones that pop up on Pinterest and that women are going crazy about. Obviously also keeping in mind that you need to actually like these styles. You can just copy a style that you're not even interested in because then you're going to look uncomfortable, your shoulders are gonna roll forward, you're not really gonna look good. But if you wear something that you actually enjoy, that you actually think that you look good at, all All of a sudden you're floating, right? You're all cloud nine, you're confidence levels skyrocket, so it makes all the difference. But here's the kicker, why Pinterest? Well, look, Pinterest is really valuable because 76.2% of the global users on Pinterest are female. So, photos that perform well on there, they've already been filtered. They've been selected according to the female gaze. You can even search by image and insert photos of similar people found online, or even photos of yourself, see what shows up. So what you need to do is find that balance between showing your authentic style, showing who you are and your personality through style, while obviously appealing to the women that you're looking out for, that you're actually trying to become attractive to. Something really interesting and powerful that you need to know about style and clothing is that throughout history, clothing hasn't just been about style or comfort. It's been a really powerful tool to signal stats, It kind of manipulates appearances and it plays these psychological games in society. And guess what? These strategies are as relevant today as ever. In fact, there's still one main trick. It's still being used especially when you want to catch a woman's eyes. So what is this trick and how does it work? Well, remember how earlier I mentioned that it takes about 7 to 10 seconds for someone to form their first impressions of you? Well, it turns out that 62 to 90% of that decision can actually be influenced by the color. Now, you're probably wondering if there's a truth to colors making you look more attractive, but studies actually suggest that they do. Take red, for example. It projects confidence, superiority, making it a powerful and attention-grabbing color. On the other hand, black offers this mysterious, right, this suave, slimming effects, projecting a taller, modern, fashionable, and sophisticated vibe. But let's get deeper, let's get more personal. What colors work best for your complexion? Well if you have a lighter complexion, it's shown that cool tones actually like navy blue, emerald green and royal purple, they can actually add depth and contrast to your skin. And then warm tones like peach, salmon and light brown, they bring out the natural warmth in your complexion. And natural shades like beige, gray and white are really versatile, but they pair even better with lighter skin offering a clean classic look. If you have a darker complexion than wearing something more vibrant like a blue, a deep purple, or a bright red, it makes a bold statement and it brings out the richness of your skin tone. I know I mentioned a lot of colors but there's actually a single tool that makes deciding what colors to wear very simple. The next time you open your closet I want you to use this color with it. It actually just match the mood that you're going for. Only men who understand what women are attracted to realize how significant colors are in determining your vibe. So if you go for a lighter, more neutral shade, then you're probably more approachable. Once you start using the color reel, you'll be immediately able to put together outfits that look good and perfectly match your personality and your skintone. There's a special way to layer and mix your colors that actually impress women because a lot of them can't even do it themselves and it makes you look incredibly in control of your life and the things around you. Even if it's unintentional, even if you didn't think about it, women will actually pick up on your colors that that you're wearing and they'll subconsciously create a narrative about you which is so interesting to me but I've done so much research on this and it's absolutely true. This is why you don't want to mix the wrong colors. If they clash you end up looking weird and you'll get the vibe that something is off that you're trying too hard. Again, try hard. That's not what we want. First let's talk about the sandwich method. This is a video I did anyway viral people really liked the idea and it makes it so easy. It's like building your favorite sandwich but you don't get to eat it because it's from your wardrobe. And the way that you're going to build this sandwich is by having the two colors the same color top and bottom and then a different color in the middle whatever you like to put into your sandwich that's the middle. So the top of your outfit we match the bottom with your outfit and in the middle you have that contrasting or complementing color. And that's not even it this next method is it's even easier. The sandwich method is all about coordination and the LMD method it adds depth and depth makes an outfit just stand out and makes it look so much better. All you have to do is take one item lighter in tone and then add another with a medium tone and then finish with a dark tone. All right ready you get it's LMD light, medium and dark. That's why the colors I'm wearing it always follows both the LMD method or the sandwich method it just works out so much easier. So next time you're standing there looking at your closet you have no I do what to wear think L&D sandwich method and for sure you'll be able to leave your place looking very well coordinated And you know what else attracts attention is living your life with Intention and guess what stepping out of the door dressed with intention it shows that so remember to use color to its full advantage Because that's what will stop you from being invisible from just blending in in the back It actually creates a narrative for you it shows people that you do want to be seen you don't want to be invisible We don't want to blend in. All right, so you got the colors down, but there's more to this. Attraction is all in the small details. In fact, this detail is so small that most men miss this one, and maybe you're missing it too. This is how you take your attraction to the next level. Now, I don't want to stereotype, and that's why I'm not making this video and telling you, hey, you should wear this specific watch, this specific jacket, not all women are the same. And you don't want the same woman that I do, most likely. But studies show that men who wear jewelry reported 73% more matches on Tinder. 73% just for wearing jewelry. Now with jewelry, you don't need anything excessive. As a matter of fact, I would highly recommend you do not wear a large watch, a bunch of rings, a thick chain. Whatever I recommend is sticking to the rule of three, where you never wear more than three pieces of jewelry or accessories at once. Now this is a very loose rule, but it's a really good starting point for men who are just getting into fashion, right? It gives you something to kind of stick by. For example, one watch, one necklace, and one ring. It's that easy. So even if you think that you can't pull off jewelry, you will be okay because this rule it basically always strikes that perfect balance with anyone. Not to bare, not to plain, not to basic, but not to flashy, not to overly done. And something to keep in mind is the psychology to color that we learned earlier. So it comes to choosing between gold or silver. Consider what complements your skin tone, right? What complements the colors that you're wearing with your outfit. It's weird because I used to always limit myself to silver. I don't know why I start gold, was it for me? As you can see, that's changed. I have a gold ring on and I have a gold watch on. Gold, it tends to pair wear with warmer colors like this brown. It adds a touch of luxury. In silver, it gives that sleek, modern edge to cooler tones. Trust me, adding the right accessories will elevate your look, leaving you feeling and looking like a new, upgraded man. So this leads me to the secret Raya outfit. And even though I was competing against athletes, famous actors, entrepreneurs, this outfit has by far gotten me the most amount of matches and dates and compliments and even made this girl remember me from a dating app and approach me in real life at that club filled with people. Very dark by the way. I don't even know how she saw me. This is what it looks like. Now let's break down why this outfit works, why it looks good and why she clearly remembered it. First, it's tailored. So it matches the golden fit rule. Let me show you that this outfit fit me perfectly. You can see the pants are more formal. I'm wearing this in polo. Everything fits really well. And I also used another method that I just taught you, the LMD method. So we have the darker polo with the medium tone. It's a gray and white jacket. So that's the medium. And then the light, which is white pants. The colors look really good by complexion. And not only that, but if you look at the accessories, I am wearing two because I'm going for a formal look. I thought three would be maybe a little too much. I'm wearing the sunglasses and I'm wearing my watch. And that means that I'm not breaking the rule of three. Look, I'm not going over three accessories. I'm telling you, if you use all these siletips, you're gonna put your life on easy mode. Watch how you're gonna get approached instead of you having to chase down girls. Watch how you're gonna get compliment. You're gonna be able to build genuine connections and relationships with, yes, a bunch of women, but also with people who will literally collab to you because they do that to me without even knowing about my YouTube channel. They come up to me to ask me what I do with my hair, what I'm wearing, what brand my shoes are from. It's life changing. It is absolutely insane how much style can just enhance your life. And that's why your best strategy by far is elevating yourself and doing things that attract women instead of chasing. And I talk more about it in this video here. Make sure to subscribe and I'll see you next time."

        "transcript": " Welcome to the no-b***g guide on how to look better and more attractive in 24 hours or less. I personally use every single secret that I'm sharing with you on this video and the difference that it made for me was life changing. Stop settling for less because if you listen and actually follow these steps, you'll see that you can look a lot better than you think. And the first step is to cancel your next haircut appointment. Why? Because most likely you're just just going to a barber that you randomly found one day. He cut your hair, he did a decent but not great job, and then you kept going back to him because it was easy and practical. And I get it, that's a mistake I made for most of my life. Because the thing is, trusting someone new with your hair isn't easy. Hair takes a long time to grow back, so if they f*** up your haircut, you'll be wearing hats for a while. But what you can't do is get complacent and go to the same mediocre barber for months, and then expect him to just magically get really good one day and give you an amazing haircut. It's not gonna happen. You need to break up with him. You actually need to find a good hairstylist, not a barber. A barber is only good with clippers. Hairstylists are good with scissors. Clippers, they have more variety. They're way more versatile. A skilled hairstylist will actually give you a haircut that highlights your best features. He's gonna tell you what your face shape is and then he's gonna give you a list of haircuts that would look good with your specific face shape. And let me tell you, that changes everything. And just to prove it, here's me before I started going to a good hair stylist. And here's me after. No other changes besides my haircut. I'm telling you, it's life changing. So I bought this thing a few years ago, and I know it looks funny, but it's gonna change your life. It's a posture corrector. It costs, I don't know, 20 bucks. And I wear it while I'm sitting at my desk working, which is great for long-term posture improvement. But while doing that, I discovered a glitch. If you wear this for one to two hours before you go out, maybe on a date, job interview, Whatever you want to feel like you have great posture for, if you wear this for a while before you leave your place, you end up having much better posture for the rest of that day. It's like a mental hack that tricks your mind to tighten your core, keep your shoulders back and your chest out, even after you stop wearing that posture correct. Now, you're probably wondering why that even matters, right? Well, you see a study in the psychological science journal showed that a high-power pose, which involves having open and expansive posture, not only affects how individuals feel about themselves, but also how they are perceived by others. Listen to this, they found that a great posture can increase testosterone, decrease cortisol, and increase feelings of power. And the results are clear. Postures that convey confidence and authority enhance a person's attractiveness and appeal to others. And bad posture, so if you're slouched over, your shoulders are coming forward, if your chest is going into you, that's seen as a turnoff. And it's seen as a turnoff by women because it makes you look like you're tired, like you're shy or even unhealthy. So practice standing with your shoulders back and your chest out. You're not only a peer more confident, but you feel it too. And look, this posture corrector on its own is not gonna fix your posture, but it helps. It's a reminder to remain a good posture throughout the day. But of course that's not enough, right? And we're not stopping here. I want you to look your best bike tomorrow. A long time ago, I kind of stumbled upon the secret. I was visiting my family in Brazil and I forgot to pack my razor. So I decided to let my beard grow for the two weeks that I was there. And to my surprise, I started getting a lot more attention from the women there. I hadn't changed anything besides my facial hair, that's it. But the difference was night and day. I noticed it was happening, but I didn't really know why at the time. Until I took a good look in the mirror, and I noticed that the longer stubble, it framed my face really nicely. It made me look more mature. It made me look more masculine. And he made my jawline look more chiseled. Literally, it gave me a better jawline. Because as men, we have the advantage of using this facial hair to create an optical illusion of a more symmetric face and a sharper, more defined jaw line. And listen, according to science, beauty comes from symmetry. Anything in nature that's symmetric is considered to be more beautiful because it's closer to perfection, which is obviously unachievable but desired. And this is especially helpful if you have a round or oval face shape. And if you want to widen your jaw line to achieve that strong masking look, all you need to do is create sharp lines that frame your face properly. And you can't really do that with normal shaving cream because it foams up and you can't see what you're doing. And this is the one that you're looking for. Look, I might be biased, but this is the best shaving cream that you will ever use. This is the new Forte series Royal shaving cream. And besides the packaging, which let's be honest, this looks like the most luxurious shaving cream that you will ever see. The formula is non-foamy. So it creates a protective barrier between your skin and the razor. It creates that nice, easy to glide layer of product on your skin, which gives you a great comfortable shave, but it gives you that ultimate precision that you want. so you can create those lines and get that optical illusion going. And something else really cool about the Royal shaving cream is that it also doubles as a beard conditioner. So it's multifunctional. You can use it to shave, but then you can also just put it onto your beard and leave it in as a leave-in conditioner. And today's a special day because besides just launching the shaving cream, we're also launching our very first beard oil. I'm so excited about this because I've been using it for months and I couldn't wait to share it with you. This is a game changer. If you have facial hair, even if it's just a stubble, all the way up to a longer beard, It's gonna moisturize, soften and condition your facial hair, leaving it feeling healthier than ever, and it looks healthier too. It looks shinier, so you can just apply it on, making sure that you're shaping your beard, whether you're using your brush or your hands, no matter the length of your beard, and it's gonna nourish your hair as well as the skin underneath it. Make sure to get in there. And again, the packaging is incredible. It's gonna look so good on your bathroom counter. Both the Forte Series Royal Shaving Cream and the Forte Series Beard Oil launched today. I can't wait to hear where you think about it. I'm gonna leave that first link in the description below. Go shop at Forteseries.com. These are our first beard products, so I'm sorry, I'm pumped. I'm so excited because I've been using them for a while. Now, onto the next tip, lower the inflammation on your face. You know, sometimes you wake up and you feel like you look rounder, right? You look in your mirror, you don't look energized. You look kind of tired, your face is a little rounder, you have some dark circles, maybe your face is puffy. And sure, not getting enough sleep can lead to that fluid retention. It can make your blood vessels under your eyes dilate, It creates dark circles. There's a lot of reasons for having that puffy face. Maybe you were out drinking the night before, but what I recommend is for you to get an ice roller. This device right here has a roller at the tip and it freezes overnight. So when you get up in the morning, just pull it out of your freezer and use it to deep puff your face. Not only is it gonna deep puff your face, it's also going to minimize your pores. And besides that, it actually feels really nice. It feels energizing. It kind of gets me up every day when I use it. It just makes me feel a lot more alert. And what you should do is focus on the area under your eyes so you can deep puff your eyes, focus on your jawline, which helps with the lymphatic drainage and reduces that puffiness. So your jaw doesn't look as round. It gives you a sharper jawline. And then focus on your cheeks to constrict the blood vessels in that area, giving yourself the best chance possible to achieve hollow cheeks. It shapes your face really nicely, and it's what you see models do when they're walking down the runway or taking photos even. They literally suck their cheeks in. It's a known model technique to give yourself that hollow cheek, obviously, just for a moment. And speaking of tired eyes, dark circles, puffy eye bags, sounds horrible, right? But there's a way to fix that. And this is one of those things that you can literally fix in 24 hours. It should be very, very quick. All you have to do is use a cooling eye serum. It's like a quick refresh button for your face. It reduces puffiness and it wakes up your eyes. A good one will have a cooling metal tip, which kind of acts like that ice roller that we spoke about earlier. This one from Apricus also has caffeine, it has peptides, and it has hyaluronic acid. Those three ingredients combined with the cooling tip will make you look more alert, more engaged, less tired. They will deep puff your eyes. It will help you fight those dark circles. And honestly, it feels really nice. Immediately you feel more revived, you feel more awake. It's something that I apply every single morning to get my day going. This next glow-up tip is so underrated. If you've ever watched a bodybuilding competition, then you might have noticed They all have something in common, besides the giant muscles and the very, very small speedos. They all get a spray tan before the competition. A tan gives your skin a healthy glow. It makes you look more active. It makes you look more athletic. It literally makes you look like you've been outside, like you've been getting some steps in. When you're pasty white, it looks like you haven't been outside in a while. But the most important part of a tan isn't even that. And the reason why bodybuilders do it is because it literally defines your muscles. It makes you look more shredded. It creates shadows around your muscles and makes them look more defined. It makes them look bigger. This is a game changer. Think of it as contouring your body where the play of light and shadows, it basically defines your muscles, defines your features. Of course, this isn't as important if you live somewhere cold in the winter time but in the summertime, or if you're going for a pool day, a beach day, or whatever, if you're taking your shirt off somewhere, definitely make sure that you get a tan before because it just makes you look so much more alive and so much more defined. Now there's a few ways of doing that. You can get a spray tan, do it yourself, get someone to come to your place and do it for you, or you can just go somewhere and get it done. Or you can actually just get a tanning lotion and a mitt and just tan yourself. This is something that I've done a lot if I'm going on a shoot, if I'm doing like a shirtless shoot for a brand or something like that, then I'll definitely get a tan before, especially if I haven't been in the sun because I've been indoors working. And by the way, if you're not subscribed yet, then welcome. My name is Alex Costa and it's my job here to elevate your looks, your style, your confidence, all through these free videos on YouTube and my other social media accounts. And we just passed four million subscribers on the channel, so comment below, let me know when you subscribe, I'd love to know where you're from, and I'll be answering a ton of those comments in the next few days. I have a glow-up tip that doesn't even take 24 hours to make you look better, it literally takes three minutes. And it's such, again, another underrated tip that guys just don't really go for, which I don't understand. But you should definitely use a tinted moisturizer from now on. It's a tinted moisturizer. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a moisturizer for your face that has a slight tint to it. So when you apply the moisturizer, it's moisturizer your face. It's a nice creamy texture that hydrates your skin. But also it blurs any imperfections, any sun damage, any pimples, any pores, any blackheads, anything that any texture that you want to smoothen out, that's going to help blur it. And the best thing about a tinted moisturizer is that other people will not be able to tell. If you just apply a very thin layer on your face, you're gonna see the difference, but other people, they won't even know that you're wearing it. And I think that's the reason why a lot of guys get scared of trying a tinted moisturizer. They think people will find out or notice and they'll feel embarrassed. Trust me, no one's gonna notice. And you will feel so much more confidence, especially if your skin isn't looking great that day. This is a quick fix, and immediately you're gonna look so much better. Now we've talked a lot about looks and how people are gonna perceive you and making sure that you look attractive within 24 hours. But there's one thing that you can do right now enhances your aura. It enhances your presence even if people can't even see you. And that's the way that you smell. If you walk in somewhere and people can tell that you smell great, that you smell sexy, attractive, or masculine, immediately people's perception of you are going to be different. They're going to think, hey, this is a guy that takes care of himself. Hey, this is a guy that smells really good. He's got great hygiene. They might even be jealous and ask what kind of fragrance you're wearing. Most guys don't use fragrances to their advantage. They have one or two fragrances and they just spray it anytime, anywhere for any reason. That's not how fragrances work. What you should do is you should have fragrances for specific occasions. So if you're going out on a date or if you're trying to meet girls that day, definitely wear something that's more sexy, that's more powerful, that's more masculine, more intriguing. Now, if you're going out to grab groceries, if you're going out to hang out with friends during the day, then you want something that's fresh, that's clean, that's maybe powdery. If you're going into an airplane or you're going into the office, don't wear something that's crazy overwhelming, where something that's more subtle, more light. Different fragrances for different occasions. That's how this works. And if you want a list of the best fragrances for men, definitely watch this video right here. Don't forget to check out that first link below for the Forte Series beard products that just launched today. And I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Have you ever heard of a Bugatti razor? Yeah, Bugatti, like the cars that cost millions of dollars. Razor is a collaboration between Gillette and Bugatti. And not only is it a masterpiece in design, but it's heated to prep your skin for the best shave possible. And it comes with this beautiful magnetic stand, and it honestly just puts other razors to shame. Just like the Bugatti razor, in this video, I'm gonna show you 25 incredible items that will make you look so good, your friends are gonna start asking you for advice. And this video is not sponsored by any of the brands that I mentioned today. None of them are paying me to promote their products. These are products that I use every single day. I do own the brand's Forte series in Africa skincare. All right, stepping to my office, AKA my bathroom for a second. Besides a good razor, every man needs a good trimmer. And I absolutely love this one. This is the Phillips Noroco Series 9000. This thing is built like a tank. It has an adjustable guard head right here that's built in. And if you want to go longer with your beard, it also comes with the extra attachments. Next is the Manscaped Nose and Ear Trimmer. No one wants to see your nose hair or ear hair. So you got to have one of these. I've had this for a couple of years. It's simple, it gets the job done. I use it every couple of weeks or if I see any hair in my nose or ears. Next is this Andis cordless shaver. This was actually a recommendation for my barber. It's great for in between haircuts. I use it on the front and back of my neck and on my cheeks. All right, it's about to get fun. Step into my shower. I use this silicone body scrubber every day. I used to have a luffa, but I heard those things actually collect a lot of bacteria. So this feels really nice on your skin. It's affordable and I'll link it below. Next is this Malin and Gets Rum and Body Wash. This is my favorite body wash. I've been using this for a long time. It smells really, really nice. It's kind of sweet, but it brings back really good memories because I've been wearing it for so long. I love the razor, but this is the shaving cream that I use with the razor. This is the Forte series Royal shaving cream, and it's a game changer. We developed a non-foaming formula, which means you can see what you're doing. You can see where your razor is going instead of just having foam all over your face. And that formula creates a thin protective layer on your skin to make your razor glide nice and smooth for a close but comfortable shave. And to keep my beard soft, I use the Forte series beard oil. This softens your beard, adds a natural shine to it, and it makes it look more tamed. And I'm really proud of my team with this one. These are incredible and they look so good. The packaging is gonna look amazing on your bathroom counter. And they come out on March 2nd. All right, this is gonna be fun. I'm gonna bring you guys into my bathroom slash storage room slash fragrance collection. Here's my fragrance collection. So I'm gonna recommend you three that I like on the affordable side and then three luxury ones. Three affordable ones I would say Abercrombie Fierce Cologne. This thing smells really good. It's nostalgic and it's affordable. Aquadigio, for sure. This is such a great fragrance. Everyday fragrance, casual, fresh, great for daytime. This is the other perfume, so slightly more long-lasting. And the next one, I'm gonna go with the classic too. Versace Arrows. I know a lot of people may find this one, but it's such an amazing fragrance. It lasts forever. Great for clubbing, great for going out, great for going on dates, getting numbers, if you know what I mean. And then three luxury fragrances. I go with Creed Aventus. I feel like this is the Rolex Submariner of luxury fragrances. It's a fragrance that every guy kind of gets when he wants to step into that luxury type of fragrance, that niche market. Absolutely love this one. You can't go wrong with it. It is expensive though. Tom Ford Ombre Leather Pafum. You're going to smell like a good looking guy in a leather jacket who's also a biker. handsome, but like slightly rugged. I feel like that's exactly what this smells like. You can kind of get the vibe. And last but not least, perfume de Mali Haltain. This is a great fall and winter fragrance. It is powerful. All you need is one spray and it fills up the room. Here's the thing, you can do all this skincare in the world. You can have a perfectly trimmed beard, but your body needs to be on point if you're trying to look good. So three products that I recommend are the Optum Nutrition Way Protein. This thing is a beast. I've been drinking this for a very long time. It's very famous, very popular. I also recommend you get some creatine so you can build some mass. This has 72 servings from Cellicor. I take it every day. It's got five grams of creatine in each serving. And then vitamins, of course, these athletic greens, these are great because they come in little packets for on the go. So when I'm traveling, I can just throw these into my bag and I'm good to go. When it comes to skincare, you probably already know that you need the basics, face wash, moisturizer, and exfoliant, the exfoliant only twice a week. Now, I'm not gonna talk about those, you already know the basics, but these two products, I think if you throw these on top of the basics, then you have a really great skincare routine. The first one being this retinol. It fights aging, reduces fine lines and wrinkles, and it improves the texture on your skin. Make sure you only apply it at night before you go to bed, and don't go into the sun the next day, or wear a ton of sunscreen, because this is pretty powerful stuff. And the next skincare product that I recommend Every guy uses is an eye serum. Now this is gonna deep up your eyes. So if you have a long night, if you go out, you have a lot of fun, the next day you gotta go to work or you have a date or whatever it is. This is gonna deep up the bags under your eyes, make them look less tired and fight those dark circles that we all hate. Plus it has a cooling tip, which is really great for deep puffing your eyes and feels really nice. Of course I use my own hair products every day, but you should use whatever hair product works for you, for your hair type, for your desired outcome. Look up hair products through your own research and find something that works for you. Because I truly believe that hair can completely change the way that you look, so it's really worth doing some research and looking into it. Now let's talk about my favorite topic, hair products. Why is it my favorite topic? Well, because I truly believe that a guy can go from a six to a nine just by changing his hairstyle. And you can see that, you can see my hair evolution all on YouTube. So you see the difference it makes. It's like makeup for men. It's like the transformation that women go through with makeup. we can do that with just a simple haircut. That's why I love creating hair products. That's why I love talking about it. And that's why I think you should invest in good hair products. The first thing I recommend every guy have in his bathroom is a hair dryer. Doesn't have to be the Forte one. By the way, I obviously am going to promote the products that I created because I truly believe in them. Otherwise I wouldn't put my name literally on the products. But I would just say you need a blow dryer. Doesn't have to be this one. Why? Because it lets you control your hair and do things that you wouldn't normally be able to do. My hair is pretty wavy, so with a blow dryer, I can control it and I can make it look pretty much any way I want it to look like. To blow dry your hair first, you need to apply a heat protectant. This is the Forte Series Argan Oil, or you can just find something else on Amazon if you want, totally up to you. I love this product, I use it every day, and it's one of our best sellers, if actually not our best seller of all time. Why? Because it smells great, it makes your hair feel soft, and it protects it from any heat, so if you're using a flat iron, if you're using a hair dryer, this protects your hair from that heat, which really damages your hair. And of course, you can't forget the styling products. The sea salt spray has been selling a lot because guys really like the flowy waves and curls. And this is the perfect carefree hair styler for that type of hairstyle. And then if you have thin, flat, fine hair, you want something that gives it body, right, maybe you're losing some hair and you want it to look a little bit thicker. The Forte Series hair styling cream is what I recommend because it's pretty mild on your hair, but it still gives great hold. And of course, a bright white smile is a must if you're trying to look good. So I highly recommend you get these crest whitening strips. Now I use these once every couple of months. You're not supposed to use them a lot because they actually damage some of your teeth. So there you go. That's the disclaimer. But I do use it and all you have to do is leave it on your teeth for one hour, then peel them off. By the way, I do have veneers up top. So I only use these in my bottom teeth because you're not supposed to whiten veneers. And of course you can look good, but if your breath stinks, that's not good enough. I highly recommend you get an electric toothbrush. It doesn't have to be this one. This is like, got all the bells and whistles. This is, the name is a mouthful, no pun intended. It's like Phillips Sonic Air Diamond Clean Smart 9300 or something, but it's top of the line. I love it. And obviously I use it multiple times a day. So I wanted to get a really nice one. All right, time to look your best. You got this. Let me know if I missed anything in the comments and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Most young men go through a period of their lives with tons of pimples and breakouts and I was no different. All through middle school and some of high school, I was insecure about my skin and felt like that's all people were looking at. And that took a huge hit on my confidence at school, to make friends and to feel good about myself. It got to a point where I didn't like going to school because, well, for one, my family had no money. We had just moved to the US, so we didn't have the nicest clothes. Then when my skin started to act up, I just wanted to stay home and hide until it went away. Now, obviously I couldn't do that. I had to go to school, but thankfully I found the solution. And although for some of you, your skin will improve as you get older, for a lot of you, that won't happen until you actually do something about it. And look, it's one thing to have pimples as a teenager because as you look around, you notice that a lot of your classmates are having the same issues. As a matter of fact, the American Academy of Dermatology says that 82% of teenagers from ages 14 to 16 have acne. But it's another very different situation when you're past those years and you're still getting those frustrating pimples. But the good thing is that it doesn't have to be that way. Skin care doesn't have to be complicated. Today I wanna show you how you can achieve glass skin, which is flawless, clear, and healthy skin with no visible pores and acne free. It's essentially what we all want. And it's what you'll achieve if you follow the steps in this video. And the best part, look, it takes a long time to build your physique. You have to work out, you have to eat healthy for months or even years. With skin care, you can actually achieve great results a lot quicker in a matter of weeks, As long as you're consistent, the results will follow, but you have to be disciplined. You're gonna have to build some new habits and let go of others. Something that I recommend you stop doing immediately, and maybe you're doing this right now, as you're watching this video, is touching your face. That's a bad habit. Unless you're going through your skincare routine, there's no need to touch your face. As a matter of fact, from now on, I want you to always notice when you touch your face. And every time you do that, I want you to attach a negative reinforcement to that habit. Could be just an easy soft slap on your own hand, or just think to yourself, I failed the game. This is just a simple way to recognize that you shouldn't be doing that. Why shouldn't you touch your face? Well, think of all the things your hands touch throughout the day. Greasy food, handrails, steering wheels, and who knows what else? That means that you're transferring all of those particles straight to your face, which obviously is going to cause breakouts. So the only time that you're touching your face is when you're going through your skincare routine, which should be very simple. And I'll tell you why it needs to be simple because the opposite of simple is complicated. It's stressful. It's time-consuming. So by keeping it simple, you're making your life easier and you still get those great results I'm gonna keep you real with you guys. I have a ton of skincare products. I'm 35 I have the financial means to buy the best skincare products on the market and I like having a more advanced skincare routine Which we'll get into detail here later in this video But you definitely don't have to especially when you're just starting out if I was starting my journey to glass skin today This is all that I would do wash my face with a proper face wash not a bar of soap not with body wash Not with hand soap with face wash Why because the skin on your face is more delicate than the skin on your hands or your arms and these products are made for that Specific type of skin. They're also made with ingredients that target that area for example Allo for irritation and sun damage pohoba oil to hydrate and reduce acne breakouts and cucumber to reduce dark spots I wash my face twice a day once in the morning after I work out and once at night before I go to bed Keep it simple and if you're serious about your skin, I highly recommend you listen to this Don't be aggressive when you're washing your face all of that pulling and rubbing is bad for your skin in the long term So you need to remember that the skin on your face is fragile especially around your eyes Which I'll talk about later But here's the problem with cleansing your face and I'm sure you've felt this before after you wash your face Your skin feels kind of dry. It almost feels a little stiff That's because you're cleansing your face from those dirt particles and all that gunk and pollution But it also strips away some of those natural oils leaving your skin feeling dry. And look dry skin sucks. It looks bad. It burns. We don't want that. So to combat that you're gonna need to add a layer of moisturizer when you're done washing your face That's gonna replenish that natural glow. It hydrates your skin And it creates a protective barrier from those dirt particles that we don't want. And this is a non-negotiable You need a moisturizer if you're gonna have great skin. Sunscreen is the most important step of this entire process. As much as we need the sun to survive, it's also our skin's worst enemy. Exposure to those UV rays will cause wrinkles, sun damage and sunspots. And if you think you can skip the sunscreen because it's not sunny outside, think again. About 80% of UV rays can penetrate clouds and reach your skin. So you should use sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily and reapply it every two to three hours if you're sweating or swimming. And if you think this isn't serious, I'm about to change your mind. This photo from the New England Journal of Medicine shows a 69 year old man whose left side of his face has severe sun damage. Can you guess how this happened? This man, his name is Bill McKelligott. You can research this. He actually was a truck driver for 28 years and he was exposed to UV rays from the truck window on the driver's side every single day. The left side of his face is more wrinkled, it's saggy and essentially, I mean, it looks 10 years older than his right side. I know this is an extreme example, but this is what the sun does to your face. You might not see it right away, but it's happening slowly every time you forget to wear sunscreen. The last step is to remove dead skin cells by exfoliating twice a week. Studies like this one published in the dermatology surgery journal found that exfoliating twice a week can significantly improve skin texture and tone by up to 75%. That's because it removes dead skin cells, revealing the brighter, smoother layers beneath. And it can lead to a 50% reduction in acne breakouts by preventing pores from clogging. If you're a teenager or in your early 20s, this makes a huge difference. And exfoliants will feel a little different from regular face wash because they have a gritty feel to them, almost like sandy. Good ones will have ingredients like pumice powder, which is a type of volcanic rock used to remove dead skin cells. And look, I know that this immediately makes your skin feel amazing, but remember to exfoliate only twice a week because you need to give your skin cells some time before you peel back another layer. Okay, now we're getting to the good stuff. Welcome to the advanced skincare routine part of this video. The basics are great. You need them. Make sure to be consistent. But this is the part that I'm excited about because I geek out on this stuff and I've tried so many different products over the years. So I know it works and I know it's BS. And let's start with a very powerful medication used to treat severe acne. Acutane. You may have heard of it. The generic name is actually isotretinoin. And if there was ever a magic medication to treat severe acne, this is it. Basically it reduces the overproduction of an oily substance called sebum which causes acne. It exfoliates the skin and it reduces inflammation. It can take your skin from this to this. So I get why people are drawn to this. But the problem with Accutane, and I know you don't want to hear this, is that it has a ton of possible side effects. Including extremely dry skin and lips, muscle aches, headaches, depression and more. So yes, it works. But if you're considering this, you should absolutely dive deep into research and talk to a doctor before ever considering this medication, but just know that it exists and it does work. The other more advanced product in this one I use daily is a cooling ice serum. And for some reason a lot of guys neglect this one and their skincare routines. I used to be one of those guys, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the skin around your eyes is so important. That's literally where people look at when they're talking to you. It's called eye contact. You want something with hyaluronic acid and peptides that plump the skin and smooth out those fine lines and wrinkles. And caffeine to brighten those dark circles which about 50 to 60% of the population suffers from. Those bags under your eyes and those dark circles, they make you look tired, they make you look older. So this is a no-brainer for me to add to my skincare routine. I've been using this one for about four months now. It's our new apricot cooling ice serum. And what I love about it besides the ingredients is the cooling metal tip that immediately de-puffs the bags under your eyes. You know how some people use the cold spoon hack to de-puff your eyes, well spoons are for eating soup. This is actually made for the skin under your eyes. Just use the cooling metal tip to gently apply the serum under both of your eyes daily and that's it. I'm going to link this product and the others that I've mentioned in this video in the description below. Okay so last year I went to a car show in Pebble Beach. It was incredible. I saw the most beautiful cars that I've ever seen. It was really gloomy outside and remember when I told you that 80% of UV rays get through clouds and they reach your skin? Well I was stupid. All right not only Not only did I forget to apply sunscreen, I also applied a vitamin C oil that I really like and I recommend if you have really dry skin, I use this one here. But using this oil that day without sunscreen was a huge mistake. I was outside all day and yeah, it was cloudy, but I could feel my skin burning. I was basically cooking my face with oil and I got these nasty sunspots right on my nose and it was bad. I had to go see a dermatologist because they were really nasty. She recommended two products. One is a dark spot serum to fade the appearance of those dark spots. I got it from Dermalogica but just so you know, it's pricey, it's $99 but it worked. I saw a huge difference. Within a month of using this daily, the sun damage had faded and it evened out my skin tone especially around my nose where I had most of that damage. And the second product you recommended was this blemish and age defense serum from Skin Suiticals for age defense because the sun that day caused some real damage. Again, this is another very expensive product, $106. Do you need these? Well, not unless you went through something similar or if you have sun damage that aged your skin. I've been using these products for about a year now and I can say that they definitely work. If you're looking to reverse sun damage and premature aging, they work. Do you need them? That's completely up to you. But one product that I would highly recommend everyone to start using at night is a retinol, especially if you're in your mid-twenties and older. This is a powerful ingredient that combats aging, reduces fine lines, wrinkles, improves skin texture and tone. There are a ton of studies like this one from the American Academy of Dermatology that show a significant reduction in wrinkles after only 12 weeks of retina use. It'll help you with those fine lines around your mouth, crow's feet, frown lines, all of which make you look older. The one thing about retina is that you have to start slow twice a week, then you can increase the usage. And if you're using it, you have to wear sunscreen because it leaves your skin even more fragile to those UV rays destroying your shot at beautiful glass skin."

        "transcript": " Everyone is talking about the old money aesthetic. Old money aesthetic. Old money style. Old money aesthetics. The style, the vibe for both men and women. This is an old trend that came back and absolutely blew up recently. And by the way, if you've been living under a rock, it means quiet luxury. Think conservative, timeless style made from luxurious fabrics like cashmere, linen, silk. It's a subtle display of success. And if there's any branding, it's discreet designer labels, elegant accessories, polos, in shirts, tailor trousers, loafers, overcoats. They call it stealth wealth because these pieces could be extremely expensive, but you never know because there aren't massive logos or branding. It's classy as opposed to the new money aesthetic, which is loud, obnoxious. There's no big flashy sunglasses, instead a classic wayfarer shape, no diamond filled watches, instead smaller pieces with a vintage look and definitely no baggy clothing. Everything should hug your body nicely. And I get why this became a trend in a world where every influencer, every social media post is all about being flashy and showing off designer bags and logos. This is a breath of fresh air and I'm here for it. There's one key aspect of old money aesthetic that a lot of guys forget. Something that makes all the difference. It's the old money aesthetic hairstyle. You simply can't achieve the full old money look with this haircut or this one. So in this video, I'm going to show you five different old money hairstyles and I'm going to teach you how to ask your hairstylist for the right haircut. And I'm even going to show you a video of me getting one of these haircuts with the legend himself, Robert Maldonado in Los Angeles. If you're an old subscriber, then you know that Robert and I used to shoot a ton of haircut videos when I lived in LA. So when I visited not long ago, we had to run it back and shoot one more time. Personally I really like the old money aesthetic. It's classy, it's elegant, and you can elevate your personal style by tapping into this trend and wearing classic items and putting outfits together that look like this. It makes you look more interesting, more mature, more put together. without looking like a try-hard, which is how I would describe the new money aesthetic. Let's go over the five old money hairstyles that I recommend you try. First, the brushed back hairstyle with loads of texture. For this one, you want your hair to have a lot of texture. And if you don't know yet, texture are these lines here, as opposed to just a block of hair. To achieve it, brush it backwards so that it lays in this direction, going backwards. But the beauty of this hairstyle is that it can have some movement, some flexibility. Notice the difference between a normal slicked back hairstyle and the textured brushed back hairstyle. Look this slicked back is a cool hairstyle but it's not what we're going for. We don't want the wet look and we definitely don't want it to be flat. We want more volume, more body, more movement. And if you have a fade, you're going to have to be patient. You're going to have to wait because this hairstyle requires you to have longer sides. That's what makes it look so classic. So when you go to your hairstylist, always bring a photo reference of what you want. You can show them this video if you like one of these photos and tell him that you want about 4 inches up top and 1.5 to 2.5 inches on the sides and back and that you want textured. A pro tip for you is to use a pomade when you're styling this in a wide tooth comb to brush your hair backwards. This wide tooth comb will create the texture that you want for this hairstyle. The messy middle part is perfect for younger guys, teenagers or in your 20s. It's especially great for men who have wavy hair because what makes this hairstyle so cool is the carefree waves. It makes you look relaxed and natural as opposed to perfectly parted in the middle. It pairs extremely well with the old money aesthetic because of the longer sides and back which is a common feature that you'll be seeing across all of these hairstyles today. To style it, just apply a few sprays of the sea salt spray when your hair is still damp then style it with a comb or a brush. Now the sea salt spray is going to add hold and texture to your hair which is all you need to make this hairstyle look good. And the cool thing is you can have a pretty long middle part but you can also have a shorter middle part even with my length right now it would still look good. And when you ask your hairstylist for a middle part, tell them that you want to keep some weight on the sides and the back, and that the top should be no shorter than 4 or 5 inches and even on both sides. This next one is the most popular hairstyle of all time because it suits every face shape and it's easier to style. The side part. Now the problem here is that way too many men that get a side part today, they go for this look here. It's too short, it gives off finance bro. You want to have it a little longer so your hair starts to flow more. The size should be about an inch and the top needs to be at least two and a half inches long, otherwise you're going to look look like you work at a boring desk job and that's not really what we're going for. We want more style than that. And a good example of someone who does this really well is Ryan Gosling. His hair isn't too long but you can see the sides and they're not faded. There's a good amount of texture and volume there. And to style this you want a product that has medium hold and low shine. It's really important that it doesn't make your hair look greasy. You could go for the molding paste or the hair styling cream for this one. The Ivy League is a classic hairstyle that's been around forever and it's probably one of the easiest hairstyles to achieve on this list because it's the shortest one so it doesn't take a lot of time to get your hair to this length plus it's very easy to style. You don't even need to part your hair for this hairstyle you can just let it flow naturally which is why it's so easy to style and so natural looking. Now when you go to see your hair stylist you could go with clippers on the sides. Chris Hemsworth is a good example he does that and it looks really good on him. Henry Golding's hair looks really great here too and it looks like they used clippers but in my opinion it's a little boring. I would say go a little longer on the sides, get a scissor cut instead of using clippers. The longer sides make you look more mature, adds a touch of class and elegance, which is classic old money aesthetic. And styling it is an absolute breeze. Just use a small scoop of pomade and you're in business. Now one of my favorite hairstyles of all time is the quiff. And there are two basic ways that you can style a quiff. One is called a classic quiff. It's more formal, it has a specific shape and direction to it. I think it's the perfect hairstyle to be paired with a suit or a or a more formal look. And the other is called a messy quiff. And as the name suggests, it doesn't have that specific shape. It's more flowy, it's more dynamic, and it's less formal. So you can have this hairstyle wearing a casual outfit. Now the beauty of this is that you can get one haircut, which is the haircut that I got with Robert in Los Angeles, and you can style it in those two different ways. I love that because it's versatile. I can decide based on what I'm doing or what I'm wearing that day, if I want a formal, classic quiff, or if I want a casual, messy quiff, and they both look great. One haircut, two hairstyles that are pretty different from each other. It's the perfect hairstyle for the old money aesthetic. When I think of a classic quiff, Matt Ballmer immediately comes to mind. He pulls it off really well, but he also switches it up from classic to messy. And you can see the difference here. The messy quiff is a little longer, more flowy and carefree. And to style this, you need something with good hold, but it can't be too stiff. You need some flexibility there. So use the Forte series hair cream. That's gonna be your best bet. And if you wanna see a list of the best men's hairstyles for 2024, not the old money aesthetic ones, then I just posted a video showing you all of those as well. I'll see you there."

        "transcript": " Excuses sound best to the person that's making them up. I will not wait. Wake your ass up. How bad do you want? When you want to succeed, as bad as you wanna be, then you'll be successful. It's not over until I win. There is no success without hardship. If you're going through hell, keep pushing, keep moving because this is personal. What if you decide to make 2024 the best year of your life? What would it look like? Today I want to give you all the tools you need to make that a reality so that you can have the greatest comeback of your life this year. When I was a kid, my mom made this board with chores, like cleaning your room and making your bed. Anytime I did those chores, she would just stick a star on that board under that specific chore. At the time, I thought I was just playing a game. Now that I'm older, I realized that she was teaching me a really important lesson. She was literally teaching me how to be an independent disciplined man. Your place is an extension of yourself, So if your place is messy, that makes you a messy person. And is that how you want to think of yourself? Is that what you want other people to say about you when they describe you? Messy, dirty, I'm assuming it's not. Clean your room, wash your clothes, and don't forget to do your dishes. And go deep, don't dump your clothes into a drawer and think that your room is organized. Actually organize your, do your laundry, fold your clothes, put them away properly. A clean and organized space means an organized mind. It gives you initial control of your life. Instead of taking your clothes off and just throwing them on the chair or on the floor, put them away immediately. Develop a habit of organizing as you go. Otherwise your space will get really messy and you'll get discouraged because it becomes a daunting task. But your space isn't the only thing that needs cleaning. There's something else that men from every corner of the world have been doing for thousands of years to cleanse, relieve stress, and to get an energy boost. And that is cleansing your vessel. Take a daily shower. Take care of your facial hair. Clip your nails. Brush your teeth. You need to feel and smell fresh. This is your one and only body. Take care of it. You put time and effort to cleanse and look good for a date with someone that you've never even met before. But what about for yourself? Have some self-respect. The last thing you want is to look into the mirror and feel sad for yourself for what you look like. Confidence comes from within, but if you don't like what you look like, then it's time to take care of that. Put on a fresh pair of underwear, a decent outfit, spray a nice fragrance and get ready to face the world and for your big comeback, which starts with momentum. Momentum is genuinely one of the most powerful forces that you can have in your life. When you start winning, it gives you the strength and confidence to win again and again. Great mornings lead to successful days, which leads to successful months, then years. This is how you beat the scan. You do it while everyone else is sleeping in the morning. Wake up early and get to work. Start building the life that you deserve. Get your workout out of the way, write a to-do list, have a cup of coffee and tackle that list. If you start your day by crossing things off your to-do list, you build a momentum that you need to have a successful day. And if you think about it, your big distraction is usually coming to evenings, binge watching TV series, going out drinking and partying, staying up late watching mindless TikToks. Even if you wake up at 1pm, you can still build a proper routine that leads to success without feeling like a failure just because you don't wake up in the normal hours. And before you can be proud of yourself and happy with not only your success but also and maybe more importantly the journey to your success, you need to understand yourself and the journey to becoming self-aware is long, it's time consuming and confusing at And the same way that I recommend you all to find a mentor that can help elevate your career I also recommend you be proactive and find a good therapist our sponsor better help makes that so easy You just click that first link below get connected with a therapist Specialized in that area that you need help with whether it's social anxiety Relationship issues or past trauma which as men most of us have and we tend to push these down and try to forget We try to be as strong as possible and suck it up without ever actually dealing with it I'm telling you, not dealing with it won't help. And he might sound like the easy way out, but you end up paying for it later in life. One man doesn't wanna know more about himself. Hone in on his qualities and be aware of his limitations so that he can improve. That's what this channel is all about, personal growth and therapy is a big part of that. You sign up online, you schedule sessions as a phone call, video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to sit in an awkward waiting room. It's discreet, it's judgment-free, and on your schedule. This is the most practical way of talking to a professional. Again, this isn't you opening up to a random person online. These are professional therapists who can give you insights that you would have never thought about because they've studied this, they know how to help. And to be really honest with you, I was one of those people who didn't believe in therapy. I thought it was for the weak and I couldn't have been more wrong. It's actually for the strong because it takes guts to open up to someone, to feel your emotions and to communicate them properly, then dissect them with that person. But the knowledge, the insights that you get from your therapist, a lot of times, you'd never even think of those things. So it's super helpful. And once you start looking at it from a perspective of, this is a person who is on my side. This is a person who's on my team helping me become a better man. Then that changes everything it did for me. And again, you can always stop it if you don't like it or swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which BetterHelp offers free of charge. If you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. So hear me out on this one. Be open-minded, click that first link in my description. It's betterhelp.com slash alexkosta and you will even get a discount on your first month. but even when you know yourself really well, you only know the current version of you. What is the future you look like? The comeback version. One of the most common issues I see men going through is that they just float through life without strategy. They go wherever the wind takes them. And then one day they realized, wait a second, this isn't where my life should be. I never wanted to be here. I never wanted to be a mechanic. I never wanted to be single at 40 years old. I never wanted to live in this city for the rest of my life. You need to visualize your dream life and strategize how to get there. So a good question to ask yourself now in order to make the greatest comeback of your life is am I just floating through life without a strategy hoping that the wind will take me in the right direction. And if you're being honest, truly honest with yourself, you'll probably realize that you actually don't have a plan and you don't know where your life is taking you, which means you can't control it. Here's what you need to do. You need to visualize your dream life. You know when people talk about manifesting something? At first I thought it was all because it sounds like a load of crap, but after I thought about it, I came to realize that it's not about looking in the mirror and saying what you want from life and hoping that one day it's gonna fall in your lap. It's about knowing exactly what you want. Knowing with as much detail as possible exactly where you want your future self to be. Manifestation works because it requires you to stop and just think about what you want from life. When I was a full-time employee at Google, I loved my job. I made six figures, I traveled the world, I had every benefit that you could imagine. A great retirement plan, health insurance, free access to amazing coaches, but I knew that wasn't what I actually wanted in my future. I wanted to be a full-time content creator. I wanted to work for myself and become a successful entrepreneur. So I'd sit and I'd write down exactly what my dream life should look like. Self-employed, financially free, living in a beautiful place in a major city. That vision drove me every single day. I knew what I wanted and I fought and worked hard for that and it became a reality. Not because I was doing some kumbaya, weird dance manifestation, but because I took the time to understand and to visualize what I wanted my life to look like. And I know these big goals can be daunting. So after you visualize the big picture, your dream life, if you're serious about this comeback, if you wanna achieve those goals, this is how I recommend you tackle them. And by the way, this is especially important for you. If you have a hard time sticking to a task, focus your responsibilities. I know a lot of you go through that. I went through that myself, and that's how I found the solution. If you write down a large task, and I'll use a personal example, posting a YouTube video, it'll be daunting at first. That's the very final task of that specific goal. It's too broad. Instead, break it down and gamify it. Write down smaller tasks leading up to that large goal of posting a YouTube video. The first task is research what topic the video is about. The second task is to write a short script for the video. The third is to set your shot, then shoot, so on and so forth. There's no better feeling than crossing things off your to-do list and it creates that momentum that we talked about. So be detailed. Get these smaller tasks done on the way to accomplish your big goal and add some wins to the scoreboard. But I also know that a lot of you might have a hard time even starting that very first task. No matter how small that task is, procrastination is the enemy of success. I'm sure you've heard that. So every time you feel procrastination slowly taking over your actions, just do this. Tell yourself that you're not gonna lose this game. Take a big breath, count to three, and on three, no matter what you have going on, you're gonna get up and you're gonna get started on that task. And this is a path that you need to have with yourself because the alternative is living a lazy life, regretting it later. And if you give up now, I can guarantee your future self will be disappointed at you. I mean, imagine being 60 years old and disappointed at yourself. You don't want that. I don't want that for you. You have so much to give and you truly only find out your true potential if you start working on it now. And I promise to help you along this journey. All you have to do is subscribe to this channel and check back in once in a while to get motivated to learn how you can improve yourself and to find your true potential as a man. Along with the other 4 million guys who have subscribed to my channel for that same reason, we're all on that same journey. And one thing I realized about this journey, thankfully pretty early in my life, is that you need to be both mentally and physically strong to accomplish your goals. Over new years, every single one of my friends got sick. I'm not even joking. Every single one of them. Everyone I talked to got sick. And this was worldwide. I'm sure you've heard about this. People getting sick in the beginning of the month, in January. And when you're sick, it makes you realize something. Without health, there's no winning. When you're sick, your body hurts, you're coughing, you're weak, your throat hurts. It's the one thing that you want. You want to be healthy again. That's all you want. Somehow I was the only person that I know didn't get sick over New Year's and I would say that it was luck or that I didn't know how this happened, but the truth is I was around sick people all the time, but I didn't get sick and that's because I've been so disciplined with my health lately. It's not luck, it's by design. I chose this. This was a choice that I made to be healthy. So eat healthy, work out daily, push yourself physically, get in great shape. You know this makes you healthier, gives you energy, makes you more attractive, So why would you not want that? And if you're having a hard time being consistent with your workouts, you need to make it a daily habit. For me, it's making sure that I hit the gym within the first hour of waking up. I know what my flaws are, and one of them is getting sucked into work and forgetting about everything else. To fight that, I had to make working out the first priority of my day. Otherwise, I just wasn't gonna do it. So how can you apply the same method to your routine? Maybe it's going to the gym straight from work, or right before your morning classes, whatever it is, stick to it. You deserve to see what version 2.0 of you looks like. And I have a feeling he's in great shape, not just mentally, not just physically, but also financially. Let me ask you this, do you know how much money you spend a month? How about a week? Do you even check your bank account daily? Because you absolutely should. I have a friend, a great guy who used to make a ton of money and he made some mistakes along the way, got into financial hardship, into some pretty bad debt. He maxed out his credit cards, took out a loan, it's bad. And he told me that he stopped looking at his accounts because it made him feel like shit. Now, I understand his pain. In 2024, I got laid off and I had to go on unemployment for a few months. I was broke. I had no money. I had a bunch of bills. He was one of the hardest years of my life. I didn't want to look at my accounts either. It made me feel like an absolute failure. It made me feel less of a man. And by the way, at the time I was married, which is something that I've never talked about here on this channel. It's a story for another day. But having a wife that I couldn't provide for, it made me feel like an absolute failure of a man. But here's the deal. If you don't look at your accounts, if you don't face that wound head on, you're never gonna stop that bleeding. How could you if you don't know how much you owe, how much you have in the bank? How can you come up with a plan to fix the problem if you don't even know the details of that problem? Not looking at your bank account and credit card statements won't make it go away. The problem is still there. And you know, my advice would be, never go into credit card debt, but I know that's not easy. I know a lot of you are there now. The thing is, you gotta face it head on, man. In general, if you're serious about making 2024 the greatest comeback year of your life, You have to stop hiding from the world. A lot of times men going through these issues, they end up hiding from the world, right? You might end up smoking weed all day, and look, I lived in California 10 years. I'm open-minded. But when you're smoking MJ all day, playing video games, watching movies, podcasts, TikToks, what are you actually accomplishing? Stop consuming mindless content. Start taking action as soon as possible. It's gonna make you feel so much better. Attack your goals head on. I can't tell you the pleasure I get from getting shit done, man. It feels so good. especially as someone who's come from nothing. Just go for it, go for every opportunity that you can get a hold of. Believe in yourself, because if you made it to the end of this video, I believe in you. Make this the greatest comeback of your life."

        "transcript": " Every new year you take a good look in the mirror and you think how can I improve this year? What can I change to look better, to feel better and to have more confidence in this new chapter of my life? And well the easy answer will always be a new hairstyle. I know it sounds superficial but the right hairstyle changes everything. Most men haven't figured this out yet but men's hair is like women's makeup. Once you find a hairstyle that suits your face shape, that properly highlights your best features, you're gonna look so much better and your confidence levels will skyrocket. I know because that's what happened to me. And it's funny because I was already posting videos on YouTube when that happened. So you can literally see the massive difference that it made for me, for my looks and ultimately my confidence levels. But I get it. Choosing the right hairstyle isn't easy. There's so many options out there. So I want to make this easy for you. Today, I have a list of the trendiest hairstyles for 2024. So by the end of this video, you're going to know exactly what to ask for when you book your next haircut and even which products to use to style it. Starting with the curly fringe. And in general, you're gonna see that texture is a big trend for 2024. And curls have a ton of natural texture, so it ties into the current trend. For this hairstyle, you need longer hair at the front, push forward so it sits on your forehead. I personally like it a little bit longer. I think length adds character to this hairstyle. But if you wanna keep it shorter, you're gonna have an easier time styling it and keeping it in place throughout the day. You could go with a fade on the sides and the back, but fades aren't as trendy right now. So my recommendation is go with a taper, which is a little bit longer. This hairstyle definitely skews a little younger. So if you're a teenager, if you're in your 20s, up to your early 30s, this is great for you. I think anything beyond that, you're probably pushing it. But again, style is such a personal thing. There's always exceptions. The main feature of this hairstyle is that curly fringe. And it's actually easier to style than you think, especially if you already have curly or wavy hair. All you have to do is apply sea salt spray, scrunch it with your fingers, then let it air dry or use a diffuser like this one here to lock those curls in. And I'm gonna list all of the styling products that I mentioned in this video in the description below. Next up, we have one of my favorite hairstyles right now, the Flow. I like this one because of the effortless, casual, but cool vibe that it gives off. It's perfect for guys with slightly longer hair who want a touch of that rugged charm. If you have wavy hair, you absolutely have to try this hairstyle. It works for pretty much any occasion. Timothy Chalamet has had this hairstyle for a while now and you can see how versatile it is. whether he's walking down the red carpet or the streets of New York, it looks great. By the way, he's 28 years old, but I've seen guys a little older than that who look great with this cut. So it's not really an age restricted hairstyle. If you're in your 30s or even 40s, you can still rock the flow. And to style it, you should use the hair styling cream, maybe a touch of the sea salt spray if you want more texture. Just make sure to have longer hair on top and then shorter layers on the sides and back so it doesn't look too bulky or heavy on the sides and back. The Wolf Cut has become a huge trend recently. I see this hairstyle in New York City all the time. It has this shaggy quality to it that makes it stand out. And I think you're starting to get this trend of effortlessly cool and tussled hair. That's really the vibe that we'll be seeing a lot in 2024. The Wolf Cut in particular has a combination of shorter and longer layers to create this wild aesthetic, hence the Wolf reference. You can see it has elements of a mullet and a shaggy cut. So it's pretty edgy. It's a cut that shows off a lot of personality. And I can see why guys would want to go for something like this. They're not trying to blend in. This is for the guy who wants to be different, who has a specific style, maybe more vintage inspired or K-pop culture, is also really into this cut right now. And again, for this hairstyle, I'd recommend the sea salt spray. It's just the best product to create texture and definition and to add that natural hold. And if you want to look your best in 2024, you should absolutely hit that subscribe button below. My job here is to make sure that you look great, that you feel confident every time you leave your house to go on a date or a business opportunity so that you can get the most out of your life. If that sounds good, join the four million guys who are part of the YouTube family by hitting that subscribe button below. And I promise I will make it worth your time. The next trendy hairstyle we'll be seeing a lot in 2024 is straight out of a 90s boy band, the messy middle part. It's funny because this was such a popular look in the 90s with the pop stars, right? Think NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, Hanson, and even actors like Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio. There's this trend cycle, it comes and goes, and right now this trend came back in full force. And what makes it different from before is that instead of straight hair, the trend is leaning more towards a messy, wavy texture, making it even more casual, more carefree, which is again, in line with the overall men's hair trend for 2024. Now, what's cool about the middle part is that you can style it in so many different ways and different lengths. You can make it your own, have fun with it. There's no rules here besides your hair needs to be parted down the middle. That's all you need. Besides that, it's a free-for-all and I love that about this hairstyle. I would for sure use the hairstyling cream for this or the sea salt spray. I swear the sea salt spray is like magic. It works for the majority of the hairstyles on today's list. Next on the list is the textured faux-hawk. This is a modern take on the traditional faux-hawk hairstyle. It combines that edgy and bold look of a mohawk with a more subtle and versatile approach, creating this style that's suitable for a lot of different occasions from casual to semi-formal settings. I wouldn't really go all the way forward. This is not a type of hairstyle that you wear with a suit, for example. Well, with a textured faux-hawk, you're gonna keep the sides of your hair a little bit shorter, but not necessarily shaved or buzzed. The sides just gradually transition into that longer hair on top, which allows for some flexibility when it comes to styling. This gives you that balance between a bold statement like a mohawk and something more traditional that you can wear out with your friends that you're not gonna look like you're trying really hard to stand out. To style this, I would go with a textured powder the hairstyling cream. Next up is the 80-20 part. Now it's called the 80-20 part because unlike a full part where you would part your hair all the way over here, you actually part it 80-20, giving the part more weight and volume. It's the hairstyle that I have right now and I've been rocking this hairstyle for almost a year now. I see it more and more on TikTok, on here in New York City, especially in guys who like me are in their 30s, who want to look presentable and go for more of that old-money aesthetic. I tend to prefer clean cut hairstyles. So this is a option if you're into that but maybe you're sick of that OG side part. Nothing wrong with a side part, it always looks good, it's a classic but it's also kind of boring. It's the safest hairstyle a man could ever have so this adds a touch of newness to it. It's a more modern approach but it still looks great in a suit, in a professional setting and it works no matter your age. And to style it I usually go with the Forte series textured clay but that's a really tough clay that holds your hair in place all day long. If you want more flexibility Which some guys do prefer then go with the pomade or the hair styling cream That's also gonna add a natural shine to your hair instead of the matte finish of the clay All right I'm calling this next hairstyle the Lewis Hamilton or hammer time or the goat whatever you want to call them But this is really just a braided man bun I have a few friends rocking this hairstyle right now and man It has to be one of the coolest hairstyles for 2024. It's edgy and tidy at the same time It shows so much personality and at the same time it doesn't require a lot of daily maintenance besides of course having to get your hair braided which can be time consuming But once it's done, you're good for a few weeks. I like that you can braid your hair in so many different ways too There's no specific braid guideline You have to follow just have fun with it and I know you're probably thinking Ah man, my hair is too short for this it's gonna take so long for it to grow for me to have a man bun But there is a secret if your hair is not long enough for this yet. You can use a hair I had friends who use hair extensions and even a fake hair bun that looks a hundred percent real that way You don't have to wait months to put your hair in a bun You can just literally get the hair extensions and that's it I remember seeing my buddy one day with short braided hair then a week later His hair was long and in a bun he showed up in the bottom like how did that happen? So I asked him and that's what he said so a fake man bun actually works for this as well Make sure to keep those braids looking good and hydrated though So I would definitely apply some of the Argan oil so they don't get frizzy You're gonna be seeing a lot of this shaggy and short hairstyle in 2024 with actors like Jacob Elordi leading the way Anyway, it's almost like a shorter wolf cut. It has that Hollywood star quality Which is great if you're trying to stand out if you want to be fashion forward It's a hairstyle that works for pretty much any age If you're rocking this you better back it up with some cool outfits because this isn't the kind of cut that you wear to work in an office This isn't for a guy who's gonna wear a boring outfit It's for a guy who wants to stand out. It's for a guy who wants to show personality and character. It's pretty easy to style because your hair needs to be short and it's supposed to look messy and relaxed. So there's not much you need to do besides kind of messing it up. I would go for a texture powder or a pomade to add definition and to enhance the natural texture of the hair. Now, if you're not into styling your hair every single day, I know a lot of guys who don't want to do that. I have the perfect hairstyle for you, the bleached buzz cut. This is going to be buzzing this year. It's a hairstyle that once you get it cut and bleached, you're done. There's nothing left to do besides looking handsome and getting compliments. It definitely makes a strong statement, especially if you made a radical change from your previous hairstyle. And I will say this requires a certain level of confidence to pull off. But what comes first? Confidence to get this hairstyle or confidence because you got this hairstyle? I'll leave it up to you to decide."

        "transcript": " It's a brand new year, a fresh start, and the perfect time to transform yourself. Let's make 2024 all about embracing change and elevating your style. This is the perfect chance to carve out a new, more stylish version of yourself. Once you know the biggest trends of the year, you'll be able to choose which ones suit your style and personality, and add that to what I call your fashion tool belt. And the more tools you have on your belt, the more stylish you become. You'll be able to dress for any occasion, whether it's a formal dinner date, a casual brunch with friends, or a wedding. And it's also a great video for men who are further ahead in their style journey, but want to know what men's fashion in 2024 will look like, what's in and what's out. Well, 90s minimalism is definitely in. And I'm a big supporter of this trend because over the past couple of years, we had a huge resurgence of maximalism, meaning bold colors, textures, logos, funky designs. And in this new trend of 90s minimalism, less is more and I love it. It's understated elegance. We're talking about well-designed pieces that have a relaxed, not crazy baggy, relaxed fit, a more classy fit without the need for all those loud or bold designs. It's all about clean lines, refined tailoring, and a sophisticated touch that says you're stylish, as opposed to yelling it out with all the monograms, crazy designs, and those all over logos. And you can see that in the latest collections from Ami, from Ferragamo, and even Bali. I like this trend because it's not about the brand, it's about the textures, the fit, the fabric, This is a style that you can replicate no matter your budget. For example, this Bali outfit, you can replace the expensive Bali coat with this $50 one from Old Navy. Then this white soft touch t-shirt from ATOS, these navy chinos from Everlane, and a navy dad hat from Ralph Lauren. Throw on your favorite accessories and you now recreated a designer great outfit at a fraction of the price. That's why I'm such a big fan of this trend. It's accessible, it's easy to replicate, especially for beginners, and it's elegant. If you take a photo of you wearing this outfit in 2024, then you look at the photo five to 10 years from now, you're not gonna be embarrassed. It's not that kind of trend. It's timeless and it's classy, but if you want something more fun, more visual, more eye-catching, then floral, botanical prints, and embroidered tops, those are gonna be hot men's fashion trends this year. It incorporates nature-inspired patterns and designs into your everyday outfits. They add a sense of freshness and personality to your wardrobe, which makes your outfits more interesting to look at. I saw a lot of celebrities wearing these shirts over the past few months, which means that this will be a mainstream trend in the next year. Shirts with visually interesting details like this one from Bather or this one from OAS with an eye-catching design that's perfect for spring and summer. I also really like what Bodhi's doing right now. They have so many fun, well-designed shirts that stand out. I actually just got this one from them and I'm going to be wearing it a lot this year. And even Abercrombie stepping in and showing some love to this trend. Now, here's the cool part. If you're trying to elevate your style, listen up. This trend is very different from 90s minimalism, right? But if you add both of them to your fashion tool belt, now all of a sudden you can decide when it's time to wear a minimalist, timeless style, or when it's time to pull out those embroidered shirts and show more depth, more personality. What I'm saying here is don't box yourself into one of these trends. It's not about that. It's about knowing how to use all of them to your advantage. And this next trend is a perfect example of that, the old money aesthetic, because I don't wear this style of of clothing all the time, but when I do, I know how to do it and I feel really good in it. 2024 will be a massive year for the old money aesthetic and if you don't know what that is, it's understated luxury, stealth wealth, meaning classy outfits without loud branding or monograms. And the fit is different from the 90s trend. It's slim fitting. It's tailored to fit your body perfectly, unlike the more baggy relaxed fits from the 90s minimalist trend. Go for timeless pieces like linen shirts, polos, vintage watches. This trend is all about classic menswear staples that show elegance and refinement. It's the perfect trend for guys who want to be taken seriously and who are maybe sick of that comfy cozy athleisure style. This is for men who want to dress more mature. Think fitted polos, tucked into trousers with side tabs and no belt loops. Loafers that put you on a different league from guys wearing Air Force 1s. Think tussled hair that flows and looks elegant and put together as opposed to crazy designs on the sides of your head. Your hairstyle says so much about you and so many men don't realize that hair is like makeup for men. A good hairstyle can completely change the way that you look. I know because I'm one of those men. My life changed when I got a good haircut and figured out how to style it with the right products. And the best product for the old money aesthetic hairstyle is Byfar Forte Series Hair Cream. It's the only one in the white jar from the collection. It's soft, it's easy to apply, but it hardens up slightly to give you that all day hold. It's not like gel or that bad quality paste that makes your hair look all greasy and dirty looking. This is a game changer, especially if you're going for a classic quiff, if you're going for a side part or a middle part, or honestly, any flowy hairstyles. And if you want something with really high hold for hairstyles like a high volume quiff, or maybe you have really thick hair that's hard to control, then the 14 series Texture Clay, that's what you're looking for. This product changed my life. It's what I have in my head right now. I travel with it everywhere I go. It's been my go-to since it launched in 2019. So I'm gonna leave a link to the Forte series website in the description below. It's that first link. Look, fashion trends come and go. And this one is an oldie that's now having a comeback and a big comeback. It's called Western Americana. And I believe it's because of TV shows like Yellowstone and the massive growth of country music, especially here in the United States. Everyone is listening to country music. It brings rugged and cowboy inspired elements into contemporary menswear. Think denim jackets, leather boots, accessories like Bolo ties and Concho belts. And look, no, I'm not about to giddy up in a cowboy fit to go explore New York City. But this trend lets you add a touch of adventure and ruggedness to your wardrobe. It's a trend that embraces the wild, wild West while staying effortlessly cool. Brands like Banana Republic, Roff Lorne and Wrangler are leading the pack and offering a ton different styles to choose from. I'm seeing a lot of men styling leather boots with suede jackets or denim shirts with trucker hats and regardless if it's your personal style or not, we all know it's a pretty cool look and when you stop and think about it, Western menswear has never really been out of style it's just become extra popular recently. As has our next trends one of my absolute favorites the classy streetwear mashup. Now we reached a critical point in men's fashion. It's now cool to blend casual with sophisticated. This trend specifically, it adds a refined touch to edgy streetwear. And it does that with items like elevated hoodies in luxurious fabrics, tailored sweats with a classy overcoat and high-end sneakers that bridge the gap between casual and upscale. This trend is all about mastering the art of laid-back elegance. So you can make a statement while keeping comfort at the forefront. And if you need any inspiration to nail this trend in 2024, then look no further than the lookbooks from Amelie Ondor. They absolutely nailed this style and I should say they probably drove this trend to be as popular as it is today. And what I love the most about this specific trend is that it looks casual. But once you look closer, it's very well put together. It's the perfect combination of comfortable and elevated and it's a beautiful mix. On to the next trend. Sounds kind of funny, but this is a real thing, the eclectic grandpa style. This is a mix of vintage charm with contemporary style. It's kind of this unexpected combination of quirky elements like sweater vests, cardigans, fisherman beanies, loafers. You see a lot of celebrities like Tyler the Creator already wearing this and I know it will only get bigger in 2024, but I want to know from you personally, which one of these trends are you most interested in? Let me know below and check out this video on on how to look and feel your absolute best in 2024. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " The first big red flag in any relationship is the lack of communication. Communication is the backbone of a healthy relationship. For example, have you ever felt like you're sending messages into a black hole, like there's no one on the other side? You send a message, you wait for hours, and then you get nothing back. And you keep checking your phone to see if you gotta reply. When these texts go unanswered for hours and you get no callbacks, it leaves you feeling disconnected. One thing to be aware of is how long does it take her to get back to you once you reach out? And you see, I understand there's a little cat mouse game and us men, we're culturally pressured to chase. But I don't agree with it and I think it shows a lack of respect if the other side is playing games with you. And maybe it's not a deal breaker, but it's something to be aware of. Is she playing games with you? Do you want to play games? Because I don't and I believe you're on the same page. But it's not just about quick replies, it's about the quality of communication. Are your conversations actually meaningful or does it feel like you're the one keeping them alive? Healthy communication involves active engagement from both sides. So if she's consistently distant or always responds in short answers, that could be an issue. And I'm all for checking in and making sure she's okay. She's not going through anything. But if this is an ongoing issue, it should be discussed and it should be resolved, which leads me to another very common issue in today's world. One sided effort. And I say it's common nowadays because social media has really put all of the weight and pressure on men's shoulders. I mean, think about it. We have to approach women very carefully, by the way, so that you don't get called a creep or a boy. Then if you get lucky and get her number, which by the way you have to ask for, then you also have to plan a date, make reservations, pay for it, and then hope that it goes well and that you get something out of it, whether it's a second day or whatever your goal is. The effort that goes into modern dating is imbalanced and we all know that, but there's a limit. If you're the one always putting in effort, it's going to get old quick and that relationship just won't work. Effort is a shared responsibility in a relationship. It's natural to put effort into making sure things work out, especially at first, but it shouldn't always be one sided. Relationships are all about mutual contribution, emotionally, mentally, physically. So if you're the one constantly planning dates, initiating conversations, trying to resolve arguments while she seems indifferent, uninvolved, that's a red flag. Feeling like you're carrying the weight of the relationship on your shoulders can be exhausting. That's because a healthy relationship needs equal investments from both partners. Both parties are contributing to the growth of the relationship. And when the effort is imbalanced, then you should just discuss those expectations openly because it can become a real issue that can completely tear your relationship apart and bring a lot of arguments, frustration and pain into the mix, which leads me to another massive red flag. The relationship is stressing you out rather than bringing you joy. Look, I think every relationship is going to go through hard times, but happiness is fundamental in any relationship. It's normal to have that occasional challenge here and there, but when being with her consistently brings you stress instead of joy. That's concerning. Relationships should uplift and support you, not drain you emotionally all the time. So make note of how you feel after spending some time together. Are you left feeling anxious, constantly worried, emotionally exhausted? You have to know the difference between the normal ups and downs of a relationship and then that constant stress arguments or just that negative energy all the time. Healthy relationships should bring you joy, growth, emotion, and fulfillment. And toxic ones bring you constant tension, anxiety, fear, stress, which needs to be checked. If you're feeling stressed alone or you just need to get things off your chest, our sponsor BetterHelp makes that so easy and I always say this, men can and should talk to a therapist. It's not a sign of weakness. It's actually the opposite. It takes strength and it takes confidence to take action and talk to someone. It's a powerful tool for men who want to become the best version of themselves. BetterHelp connects you to a therapist, specialized in whatever challenges you're going through, whether it's social anxiety, building meaningful relationships, or maybe you just need to talk to someone to ask questions without being judged. You sign up online, you schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to sit in an awkward waiting room. It's discreet, it's judgment-free, and on your schedule. Now, if you've always avoided therapy, I wanna give you two main reasons to try it. One is learning more about yourself. How long do you spend thinking about your emotions, dissecting why you feel a certain way? Probably not that long. We tend to suppress that and a lot of guys do. Therapy is gonna help you understand the core of those emotions. A lot of times we feel stressed, we feel lonely because of those unresolved issues from the past. Maybe a long time ago you got rejected by your crush in school and since then you've been so anxious, so nervous to approach any other girl. And you would be surprised at how common that is. In therapy you're gonna be able to discover those issues which allows you to address them and then move forward. And the second reason is that therapists aren't just random people, they're professionals. They can offer insights, perspectives that friends and family might not. I always thought, you know what, I'm good. I don't need to talk to anyone. I have it under control. But therapy does bring up points that I wouldn't have thought of and just that by itself. Being able to hear a point of view from a professional, something that you wouldn't normally think of, it makes you go, you know what, that's a good point. Maybe that's why I've been having a hard time making friends and that's so worth it. You can always stop if you don't like it or you can swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which better help offers free of charge if you're not happy you with yours for whatever reason. Be open minded. Hear me out on this one. Click that first link in the description. It's betterhelp.com slash alexcostup and you even get a discount on your first month. Okay. So this wouldn't be a complete video on red flags. If I didn't mention this being in a serious relationship and nowhere to be found on her social media. And I want to add a little caveat here. There are exceptions. If she's a public figure or she doesn't have social media or she doesn't post, then yeah, of course that's fine. Or Or if it's not a serious relationship yet, of course, it makes sense to not show each other online. Every relationship is different, but social media can reveal a lot about a person's commitment level. If she's reluctant to acknowledge your relationship publicly or if she portrays herself as available, it's at least worth discussing, right? Because transparency and alignment and how you present your relationship in the digital world, it's kind of funny that you have to do that nowadays, but this is an important conversation that you should have when you decide to be in a serious relationship. Okay, this next red flag is controversial, but I'm just looking out for you. And that red flag is having an only fans. If you're watching this and maybe you've subscribed to my channel, then you know my high level of commitment to help men elevate themselves through fashion and style, through the right haircut and grooming routine, through relationship advice. If you're not a subscriber yet, make sure to hit that subscribe button below and join the over four million subscribers here on the channel, all men like you working on themselves. So let's tackle this topic of only fans and specifically I'm talking about the nudity or the sexy photo shoots wearing basically nothing and of course the whole business of charging men for private messages and exclusive content. And honestly I don't personally care if it's a source of income or a form of self-expression. When it comes to a committed relationship, boundaries and comfort levels, that's all that matters. As you know I'm single now and recently I felt ready to open myself up to new relationships And a lot of times I'll be on Instagram and you know, a beautiful girl will pop up and I'm like, let's check out this profile, let's see. And boom, there it is, her OF link. And to me, that is an immediate disqualifier for a serious relationship. And look, it's possible that she needed the money or she has good reason to run that OF account. I just don't care. It's not worth my time pursuing someone who does that. See, the problem with OF is that these beautiful girls, they're making so much money, tons of cash fairly easily. And so it would be really difficult for them to give that up. And on the flip side of that, as a man, you don't want your woman to be exposed to thousands or millions of other men selling them photos or exchanging intimate messages online. You need to have open conversations about what each partner is comfortable with regarding online presence and the impact that we'll have on the relationship. Everyone's gonna be different, but transparency, respect, and understanding each other's boundaries are key in navigating these modern aspects of relationships nowadays. This is a new thing, a new topic that should be addressed early on if this happens to be a part of your relationship. It's actually pretty interesting that this is something that you need to think about, right? And me especially being so active on Instagram and being such a part of this culture, it's something that I definitely look out for. And like I said, it is an immediate disqualifier for me moving forward. Side note, I would recommend you not to support this at all. I think OF is a genius business idea, but morally it just feels wrong. 99% of the time you're not even messaging the actual girl. They have a team replying with whatever you want to hear. So just some advice for you guys going into 2024, maybe make it a goal to not go on that platform. Make it a goal to not spend any money on OF if it's something that you do now. And there are five more bad habits that I would stay far, far away from. All right, I go over those habits in this video here. Check out the description below to get matched with a therapist at BetterHelp. And thank you so much for watching. Happy New Year and I'll see you again soon."

        "transcript": " Everyone likes to write down New Year's resolutions. It's a good feeling to see those big goals on paper. Get fit, eat healthier, study more, make more money. But then come February, it's like these goals and aspirations, they vanish into thin air. And it's cool to dream big and write those goals down. It gives you something to aim for, but here's the real deal. If you don't hustle and put in the work, those resolutions are just words on paper. They won't magically happen unless you make them happen. It's the difference between wishing for something and making it real. Forbes even wrote an article noting that only 8% of people stick to their New Year's resolutions. So write your goals down, sure, but then roll up your sleeves and hustle for them. That's how you turn those dreams into reality. And I'm assuming one of your goals for 2024 is to live a healthy lifestyle and to be in the best shape possible. That's why you clicked on this video. And the last thing I want is for you to watch this video, then write down your goals and forget about them a month later. That's why I'm not only going to show you how to write your goals down for the New Years, but also how to act on them. The very first thing you need to do is to reflect on this past year and understand where you succeeded and where you failed. Self-awareness is imperative for growth. If you don't know what went right and what went wrong, and if you don't know the difference between your wins and your losses, you're going to be lost in 2024. You need direction. So here's what you do. Write a list of your successes, all of the things that went right for you this past year. You could be as small as I called my parents once a week. And as big as I got a job promotion, but they need to be detailed. I'll give you some of my list to get started. Being in the best shape of my life, this was a big success for me. In July of this year, I was in the best shape of my life. I worked out diligently, I was on a healthy diet, and the best part is I was actually having fun doing it. Reaching four million subscribers on YouTube, wild. I stuck to my posting schedule, I was consistent, increased the quality of my videos, and I hit my milestone. Hiring an assistant, it took me forever to find the right person, but I found someone who I can trust and who's helping me achieve my goals. This was a big win. And now for the less fun parts, my failures. This year I didn't launch as many products as I wanted to from my brand 40 series. I wrote the exact reasons as to why in my notes, but I won't bother you with the details. I didn't stretch as much as I wanted to physically. Like last year I set out a goal to have three stretch sessions a week and I slacked hard and I didn't explore New York City as much as I wanted to. I was traveling too much, I was too busy with work. So next year I wanna be able to take time and actually enjoy what New York City has to offer. These are just few of the many, many things that I wrote down. A lot of them are personal and I go in detail to understand why I succeeded or why I failed. Taking this time to reflect is insanely advantageous and I suggest you do that as soon as possible. What were your wins? Where did you fail? And what needs to be improved? Analyze the year that you had, take those learnings and apply them in the next year. The second thing you need to do is learn the Glychart Change formula. This formula works like magic for personal behavior change. The three variables to the left are dissatisfaction, vision and first steps. The combination of your current dissatisfaction, goal clarity and specific action plan must be greater than the resistance or pain associated with making those changes. Now what I love about this equation is that it makes you realize there are two ways to win. Way better than one. You can increase the left side of the equation, the amount of your motivation, the goals in your plan, or you can decrease the resistance on the right side of the equation. And I know it sounds complicated, but it's not. Let me explain. If you have a fitness resolution, for example, you want to tone up your body because you feel like you're currently in the skinny, fat body shape. That's your dissatisfaction. The vision is to have a six pack by the end of the year and gain five pounds of muscle. The steps are workout five days a week and eat three healthy meals a day. Those are all things on the left side of the equation. Most people don't even think about the right side, which is the resistance, which is what keeps you from reaching your goal. Here are some examples of resistance. For example, I don't have time to make breakfast, which hurts my goal steps of three meals a day. The second resistance, you don't know how to work out, you don't have a program, a plan, and you don't know the proper form. Then you need to sign up to a program that guides you along and makes it easy for you, or you will never reach your goal because the resistance would overpower your vision. Now the best way to do that is to take the 30 second quiz that I'm linking in the description of this video. It takes your height, your weight, your gender, an activity level to calculate a custom plan that fits your goals. Now, I will take the quiz right now as you're watching this video. There's no reason to wait. This is a quiz by our sponsor, V-Shred, and millions of people have used it to achieve incredible results. And it's easy to see why so many people use V-Shred. They literally have everything you need to get in the best shape of your life in 2024, right here in their app. You don't have to go extreme and cut all your carbs out or do restrictive diets like paleo or keto. Their workouts are 20 minutes or less. made for people who are busy and don't have a lot of time to work out. And what I personally like about it is that their workouts can be done either in the gym or at home with body weight and no equipment needed. Now I travel a lot. That's a huge massive resistance for me with my fitness goals. How am I supposed to stay in shape while I'm overseas or traveling for work or staying in a hotel that doesn't have a gym? Well, I lower that resistance by having access to body weight exercises right here on the app. I follow a 20 minute workout from my hotel room at any time of the day, there's no need to find an open gym or have any equipment. This is what I mean about creating systems to lower the resistance. It's life changing and it will get you to your goals a lot faster than if you just focus on the DVF, dissatisfaction, vision, and first steps because the resistance will always come up. But if your resistance was, I don't know how to lift at the gym with proper form. A lot of guys feel the same way, right? Well, V-Shred also has gym programs that you can follow with video tutorials than everything that you need right from the app. So if you're interested, I highly suggest you take that 30 second quiz. It's the first link in the description below. Something most people overlook when they're trying to live a healthier life is their sleep routine. This is something that I specifically focused on a lot this year, optimizing my sleep routine to ensure that I was healthy, to ensure that I was performing at the highest level. And by the way, it's not just about the number of hours that you sleep, it's also the quality of your sleep. Establishing a consistent sleep schedule can significantly impact your energy levels, your mood, your productivity throughout the day. Sleep is crucial for numerous aspects of our health and well-being. For example, during sleep, the body repairs and regenerates your muscles, your tissues, your cells. It enhances learning, memory, problem-solving abilities. It can positively impact mood and even reduces the risk of mental health issues like depression and anxiety. It's known to lead to improved athletic performance. It regulates your hormones. It affects your energy levels, reduces stress. I could go on and on. Sleep is king and people don't even realize it. Getting proper and consistent sleep is life-changing. That's one of the biggest reasons why I wear a whoop, this fitness tracker, to keep track of my sleep every single night throughout the year. Let's say you're going to bed every night at 10 p.m., but you stay on your phone until midnight or watching Netflix. Then you're complaining the next day that you're not getting enough sleep. Then you have to do yourself a favor. Make the following changes. Create a bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to wind down, establish a new nighttime habit. Maybe it's making a relaxing tea at 9 p.m., playing some very soothing music like jazz. I actually have a sleep prep playlist. It's literally called Sleep Prep and I listen to it on Spotify every night before going to bed. So as soon as that first song starts to play, my body, my brain, it just knows that it's time to wind down. I'll leave a link to the playlist in the description if you guys wanna check it out. Second thing you need to do for better sleep is no screens for one hour before going to bed. Third, your bed, it's for sleeping. Only lay down when you're ready to go to sleep. You have to kick that habit of laying down to be on your phone to watch something in bed. Watch it in the living room, your computer desk, then go to bed only when you're ready to sleep. I also recommend you wear a sleep mask. I wear a sleep mask every night. It blocks out any light. So you only wake up when you're ready to wake up. The sleep mask is also another signal for your body. So once it's on, your body knows it's time to sleep. It's time to go to bed. This is it. Now, let me tell you about the one change that I made to my fitness routine that completely changed everything for me and allowed me to get into the best shape of my life this year. I made exercising the first priority of my day. When I wake up, the first priority that I have on my list is getting my workout done and out of the way so that I can focus on my business. If I don't work out in the morning, I ended up getting too busy to go down to the gym. This literally happened to me last week. I was super busy with work, getting all of my holiday content done. And I woke up a little late, which threw off my whole day. I said, I'll just crush my work this morning, then work out in the afternoon, no problem. And you guessed it, I in fact did not exercise that day. I wanted to, I had every intention to work out, but two very important work calls got added to my schedule and that meant I wasn't gonna be able to get it done. I had no time. And same thing for when I'm traveling because otherwise I'll be even busier. I have so much going on when I'm gone. I wake up, open the V-Shred app, and at least I get my 20 minute workout first thing in the morning before anyone starts calling me or I have to go do things, or have any other responsibilities come up. By the way, if you're enjoying this free video, it would mean a lot to me. If you hit that subscribe and the like button, this helps me with the YouTube algorithm to keep my channel healthy so I can continue to make these videos and help as many as possible in the new year. We also just passed a huge milestone, four million subscribers, which is a huge number. And I'm just so thankful for the community that we built here over the past years. It means so much to me. Thank you for being a part of this journey. All right, so we've talked about how to set and stick to your goals. We went over exercising regularly and developing a consistent sleep routine to help you perform at 100% every day. The one missing element, right? The big missing piece here to living a healthy life in 2024 is of course your diet, what goes into your body and everyone is different. So I'm not going to sit here and come up with a bunch of fictional diet plans for you, but I'll give you something better hacks to decrease the resistance that is Eating healthy because man that has to be the toughest part of staying in shape for me working out every day I'm good. I can do that easy same note to to pizza or to Chinese food here in New York City That's a whole different ball game So here's what I did the best way to get around that and to make sure that you're eating healthy is to meal plan and Prepping and you can do this two ways the first one is cheaper possibly even healthier You plan out your meals for the week you cook them once a week Typically people like to cook them on the weekend This makes it super easy to eat healthy during the week. You have the meals ready to go. They're in your fridge You just heat them up and all of a sudden something that had high resistance becomes low resistance They're cooked. They're in your fridge. Plus, this is way cheaper and much healthier than ordering out Now the second option is to order from a meal prep company. I order from a local place here in New York City It's a local prep company and I love their food I literally decreased the resistance of ordering Italian or Chinese food Which is all around me here to a minimum because I already paid for these meals So it makes me want to eat them and not be wasteful for starters But also I know that they're healthier than anything that I would order from Uber eats or Dordache or whatever now And I went all the way you don't have to do what I did But I literally got breakfast lunch and dinner delivered for my entire week and I get that every week I only eat out on the weekends because you know I believe in enjoying life and New York City has way too many amazing restaurants. So on the weekends I explore and I have more fun with my diet, which leads me to my next diet tip, moderation, not deprivation. The key here is balance, making healthy choices most of the time. If you say, I am never drinking soda again, then you drink soda the next week, you failed. Failing is not a good feeling and that's going to derail you mentally. You're off your goal and all of a sudden you're not on it anymore. So who cares if you have another one? Instead, you should define what moderation means to you. For me, it's eating out on the weekends. For you, it might be having a can of Coke twice a week. So take some time creating customized nutrition plan that works for your lifestyle. Preped meals honestly changed the game for me. My diet got a lot better once I decided to do that. But another hot tip is to always have healthy snacks at home so that you're not eating unhealthy snacks like candy or oily chips. I get snacky sometimes and I have cotton candy grapes, yogurt, red apples, nuts, protein bars. They're all delicious and healthy snacks. And don't forget to take the 30 second quiz. It's the first link in the description of this video to understand what your body needs to reach your goals in 2024. Happy new year. Thank you so much for watching for your amazing support in 2023. I'm rooting for you. I want you to crush your goals in 2024. Go get them."

        "transcript": " 7 outfits, 7 occasions. You've been asking for a video showcasing different winter outfits and I'm here to deliver. As always, I'll list everything in the description to make your life easy and if you like the looks, the subscribe button is there to elevate your style. Let's get started with outfit number 1. This old money outfit is a special outfit for many reasons. Not only is it classy with the black, unique low turtleneck, the Persol eyewear, and possibly my favorite watch, the gold Cartier Tank Louis. but it's also comfortable and great for any occasion because of the Uniclo corduroy pants, which are soft, relaxed, but still maintain that elegance deserving of an old money title. The loafers are Ferragamo and the rugged soles are great for walking around New York City. The overcoat is from Abercrombie and has these oversized pockets that stand out. I love the contrast between the tan and the black and this is an outfit that any guy can pull off. Next is an outfit that looks good whether you're at the base of ski mountains or comfortably running errands in New York City. The Navy sweatpants are a collaboration between Todd Snyder and Champion. The fit is relaxed but not sloppy, so it's the type of sweatpants that you feel good wearing outside. New Balance had a huge resurgence recently. These are maybe the most popular sneakers of the year. The White New Balance 550s. To match the sneakers and to stay warm, I wore this white Uniclo turtleneck. Underneath the standout piece, this beautiful fleece top from J. Crew. It's cozy and has navy cuffs and ribbing to match the sweatpants. Any time I wear this, I get tons of compliments and people asking me where I got it. And J-Crew is another brand that went through a serious upgrade recently. And this top proves it. If you have an upcoming date and want to dress to impress, this outfit will do the trick. The black trousers are from Reese, the fit is classy, and I like the cuff because it dresses up the look. The chunky black boots are from ASOS and perfectly match the silhouette of the pants, while making the outfit more rugged for winter conditions. Up top I'm wearing a cost turtleneck to stay warm. It also adds a touch of elegance to the outfit as opposed to wearing a crew neck sweater or a t-shirt underneath. The Amelion door maroon corduroy jacket is absolutely beautiful and I can't get enough of it. As you know, I don't typically like big logos, but this one in particular was designed so well. With the script font and gold stitching, the crown placement, I think they did an incredible job here with the branding. The ribbing throughout has a beautiful stripe pattern and the off-white leather details bring it all together, elevating a simple all black outfit into something much more. I'm calling this one the 2025 because it looks like it's from the future. It's a fashion forward outfit with details that make it stand out from the rest. The cargo pants are from Alexander McQueen. The pockets are in front of your thighs as opposed to the sides. And I like the extra long zippers because it lets me choose if I want a tapered or more relaxed fit. The Bottega Veneta lug boots are still some of my favorite boots ever. They're oversized and rugged, so I don't mind wearing them in bad weather condition. And since the silhouette of this outfit is more oversized in general, you need bigger boots to match. So these fit the bill. I'm wearing a black sweater from SUBI underneath possibly my favorite puffer jacket ever from Hellia E-mail. It carries a modern fit. It's slightly cropped, which is great for short kings who want the illusion of longer legs. This perfectly ties into the rule of thirds, which states that one third of your outfit should be the top and two thirds should be the bottom for adequate proportions. The metal hardware adds a cool detail and of course a conversation starter. And anytime I wear this, I get questions about the brand of this puffer, mostly because of the modern fit and the metal hardware. [\"Metal Hardware\"] Commuter Costa. I'm not sure what my favorite piece from this outfit is. Even though together these pieces create a stylish look, they also shine individually. Just look at these converse boots, the details, the comfort and not shown here in the video, they're fleece inner lining to keep you warm. The cargoes are from Zara a few seasons ago, so I'll list an alternative in the description. The Grey hoodie is from one of the hottest brands right now, ALD. I like the thicker drawstrings and the minimal branding that maintains a clean design. All right, I lied when I said I didn't know what my favorite piece was. It's definitely the Canada Goose and Union Bomber Jack in collaboration. I love the Grace Leaves, the rubber logo details and how warm this jacket is. But a detail most people never see is that it's reversible with every NBA team logo etched onto the other side. I probably never wear it like this, but it's a beautiful detail that doesn't go unnoticed by the person wearing it. I wore a variation of this earth tone outfit multiple times in the past few weeks. It's stylish, practical, and has a lot of depth and texture to it. The Chuck 70s Plus are comfortable and a great addition to your closet if you want versatile sneakers. The cargo pants are from Banana Republic and I absolutely love the fit and details of these pants. From the pull strings to the side pockets, I find myself reaching back to grab these from my closet anytime I'm choosing my outfit for the day. On top we have the ATOS tank top with the script logo. It's thicker and feels more luxurious than any other tank top I've ever owned. The ATOS flannel adds texture and a nice pattern to this outfit while keeping me warm with the soft thick fabric. And this beautiful bomber jacket also from ATOS brings it all together. The script logo, the sleeve pocket detail and metal hardware stand out without being overly loud in the sand colored jacket. And if you ever get to warm wearing this in the subway or exploring a new city, you don't have to carry the jacket around. You can just use the straps to stay stylish while you cool down. If fashion forward isn't your thing, this is an outfit that any guy can pull off while still standing out from the rest. It's easy to style, but will keep you warm this season. The new Balance 550's in collaboration with ALD have a tan suede finish that's even more eye-catching once you look closer. The denim is from KOS and it fits like a glove. It's a great piece for guys who want to wear baggier jeans but don't know where to start. This is where you start. The sweater is also from Kos and although a little itchy, if worn with nothing underneath, it's thick and warm and I really like the navy color. The fleece is from ASOS from a couple of seasons ago so I'll list an alternative below. It's an easy outfit to style and wear but it'll keep you warm and comfortable in any occasion. And if you like this video or any of the outfits that I put together, hit that subscribe button below, join the YouTube family and check back into my channel often to upgrade your style."

        "transcript": " Picture this, you're feeling good, strolling down the streets, commuting to work or to see a friend, feeling confident in your stride, but there's something off here. You notice stunning women passing by, but they never seem to look your way. Why is that? Despite feeling good about ourselves, sometimes we're just invisible to women. It's like we're wearing Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. I've been there myself. When I first moved to the US and I couldn't speak English properly yet, it was really bad. It was like I wasn't even there. They would see my classmates, they would see my friends, but not me. So I had to learn how to stand out to make sure that women noticed me. And over the years, I've tested a bunch of things out to see what worked. And I compiled all of those things that worked for me into this video. For example, at a pretty young age, I decided to test out going to school with non-styled hair. So carefree, no product, just use my fingers to give it some direction, versus purposely styled hair. Look, the hairstyle wasn't great. It was like a spiky, gelled up hairstyle that's obviously not cool today. and actually quite embarrassing, but at the time, this hairstyle changed everything for me. I mean, it was like magic. It immediately made girls notice me. I went into school and all of a sudden, the invisibility cloak was gone. Girls were looking at me, a few of them even approached me. They came up to me to compliment me, to ask me about my hair. And I remember at the time I was so shy. I didn't even know what to say. So I said, I literally said, yeah, this is the new me. And that was truly life-changing. It was like a rebirth, the new me had arrived. I just needed to stand out from all of the other guys with this crazy new hairstyle that I decided to try. And the lesson was very clear to me. To be noticed, you need to be unique. Now, if you're reaching for that gel tub right now to spike up your hair into my old hairstyle, nicknamed the torch, please don't. There are far better hairstyles for you nowadays that will still make you stand out without looking like your Guy Fieri or looking like you're trying to start the new N-Sync. The point is, just try something different. If no one is noticing, you need to change it up. If you've had the side part, your entire life, How about going for a textured French or a curly undercut, a middle part, a messy quiff? There are so many hairstyles to choose from and for some reason the majority of men go through their lives without experimenting. And if you never try it, you will never know. One of the benefits of moving to the US was that I got my driver's license at 16 years old instead of 18 in Brazil. So I remember the moment I got my driver's license, the first thing I did, the first thing I did was sign up to the gym. I used to drive my green 1995 VW Jetta to Planet Fitness. It was $20 a month and it was a dream come true. I felt so free, I felt like a man for the first time. So I took working out and gaining muscle mass very seriously at the time. And within six months, my whole body had changed. I went from being this scrawny kid, 140 pounds wet, to about 150 pounds, which was a big change for me. I looked completely different with those 10 extra pounds in the right places. And this transformation made me realize one thing, Girls loved it. They were way more attracted to a guy who took care of himself, who worked out, overbearing skinny and looking weak. And the funny thing is, even guys noticed and started coming up to me and asking me what I did to look so much better. I had friends join me at the gym for workout sessions, asking me about the supplements that I was taking, which at the time was a tub of mass gainer every single month. It was the most disgusting, powdery thing ever, but it worked. Adding that muscle mass got me noticed 10 times more than before. Not just by the girls my age, but also slightly older girls in college. It was a crazy discovery for me at the time. You have to remember, there was no YouTube gurus back then. Alright, I was completely winging everything, just testing things out and it worked. As a matter of fact, a study published in Proceedings B found that women unanimously preferred men with larger arms and pecs. Unanimously. And it's not even because it looks better, because that's subjective. But being in good shape shows that you're disciplined, that you're healthy, that you take care of yourself and you're more suitable as a protector. That's what makes it more attractive.

Your style changes the way that people see and perceive you. When you look at a man in a suit, you immediately think a businessman, a boss. When you see a guy in a cool street style outfit, you think more edgy, youthful, modern style. know these two guys, but we just judge them by their looks. That's exactly what humans do. So make sure that you look your best. Your outfit should represent the man that you want to be seen as. And I'm not gonna sit here and tell you which style you should go for, specifically because it's highly subjective. But learn to dress for your age, for your environment, and for your personality. And it's not just about the top and the pants. Your footwear also needs to be on point. And if you want a footwear refresh for 2024, then check out the brand Bruno Mark. I've been working with them for years now. and what you get for the price is crazy. These black wingtip sneakers with the white soles, they look great, they're easy to style, they're super comfortable. Great for the man who wants to look well dressed without trying too hard. Also great for the guy who commutes to work and wants to look good but needs comfortable sneakers. These are crazy comfortable. I styled them with this all black outfit that any guy can pull off and they look amazing as you can see. They also have Chelsea boots, if that's more your vibe, I'm gonna link them in the description of this video and you're gonna be surprised when you see the price on these Bruno Mars shoes. it's honestly hard to believe how affordable they are. And look, every guy out there is wearing sneakers. If you want to stand out, these brown boots are great. Easy to style with any outfit that has those earth tone vibes. I went with carpet or pants, a textured turtleneck, and a long tan overcoat. And the boots are extremely comfortable. They have a zipper on the inside so you don't have to struggle to put them on or to take them off. And on top of that, if you use my code, you get an additional discount on the already very affordable shoes. So check out the first link in the description below to see all of the styles that they have. Another really easy way to stand out is by using the power of facial hair, and this is some powerful stuff. Most men don't even realize this, but facial hair can completely change your face shape. A beard or a stubble, they can create the illusion of a stronger, more defined jawline. This can add those masculine angles to your face, which most women agree is more attractive. That's why I keep this stubble year round. I know for a fact that if I shave, I just, it just doesn't look as good. The jawline is just not as sharp, all right? And it contours my jawline properly. It makes my face look more masculine. And the groomed beard can also help balance your facial features, so it creates that sense of symmetry. Symmetry is attractive. This is especially beneficial for you if you have a less defined face shape, especially round or oval. And last but not least, a beard or facial hair can sometimes make a man look older and more mature. By now, you probably already know that women tend to date guys who are slightly older and more mature. So this gives you an advantage by making you look more mature. None of that matters unless you walk with confidence and make eye contact as you walk by others. If you ever notice those guys or sometimes even girls who walk or looking down at their feet, it makes it seem like they're hiding something, like they're scared of making eye contact, which shows lack of confidence. When you're walking, I want you to remember, and I know this sounds funny, but just hear me out, stride purposefully with confidence. Avoid shuffling or dragging your feet. A good stride has purpose and it has energy. Look straight ahead, make eye contact with the people that you pass. Avoid staring, of course, you don't wanna look creepy, but a friendly nod or a smile, it just shows confidence and approachability. You need to look approachable. If you don't make eye contact with anyone as you walk by, you're never gonna know who you walked by. So from now on, walk with purpose and confidence and look approachable. This is one of the most overlooked the most attractive traits that a man can have. Now, another attractive trait that women love on men, men that are vocal instead of being shy. Now, hear me out because this is important. This in no way, shape, or form means be loud and obnoxious. That's just annoying. And that's just obvious that you're begging for attention at that point. All you have to do is not be shy when you're in a group setting or even when you're talking to one person, particularly a beautiful woman. Talk to her as if you're talking to a good friend of yours. Ask questions, make jokes, fill that awkward silence with interesting conversation, especially on a first or second date, you're both somewhat shy. You have butterflies, both of you, that's normal. So acknowledge that it's there, feel it, but don't focus on it. Focus on the conversation. What's my next question? What is she saying? Should I really need to pay attention to what she's saying so I can ask good questions and be interested in what's happening? Make that conversation interesting. Funny, show her that you're a good time. Shy guys miss out on so many opportunities because they don't speak up. Don't be that guy, let it out. And when you're speaking, project your voice to make sure that everyone can hear you properly. A lot of people don't know their speaking voice yet. They haven't found it. The way you communicate with others says so much about you. So you need to nail this. Learn to use the right volume. Don't mumble because people won't understand you. Only then will she notice you and give you the eyes. You know the eyes. And when she does, you're gonna need to know what to do next, don't worry, I have a whole video on what to do when a girl looks at you right here. Check out that first link to see all of the shoes that Bruno Mark has to offer and subscribe so you don't miss any of my next videos. I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " Your 20s might be the most transformative years of your life. You're becoming an adult. You can't hide behind the, I'm just a kid, excuses anymore. And something really important happens right around that time. You start to make decisions that will impact the rest of your life. Being responsible for making those decisions sounds intimidating and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it. Those decisions that you make at that age will either push you forward towards success or hold you prisoner in a never-ending cycle of failures and immaturity that most guys end up blaming on bad luck when in reality it's all about those daily choices that you're making, your bad habits. Five bad habits specifically that will absolutely hold you back from growing as a man. In your career, your social life, your dating opportunities, and in your life experiences. So buckle up and let's go over these five habits and how to change them to give yourself the chance that you deserve at being the best man that you can be. And a huge thank you to Neutrogena for sponsoring today's video and giving me the opportunity to talk about this topic that's been on my mind for a while now. First bad habit is excessive gaming. When you spend hours gaming every day, you feel like you're accomplishing something by leveling up or beating the game, but the truth is you're not accomplishing anything in the real world. Excessive gaming will take away from your life experience, making you friends in person, playing sports, an instrument, or working towards your goals. And if you're thinking that I don't know anything about games or that I don't understand it, you're wrong. I actually grew up playing video games. When I was younger, I'd play for hours pretty much every day. I worked in the gaming industry for years, both behind the scenes at Major League Gaming and at Google, but also as an actual gamer, playing the Call of Duty Championship with a million dollar prize pool and posting gaming content on my YouTube channel daily. Trust me, I don't talk about it much now, but I know a lot about the gaming world. And as much as I love that world, and I have a past in it, unless you're making money doing it, it will suck up all of your time in the real world, and that's when it becomes a real issue. My recommendation is to allow yourself a specific number of hours of gaming per week if it's something that you like. Give yourself a time limit, we'll ensure that you don't lose track of time, and end up forgetting that there's other things to enjoy outside of that screen. The second bad habit that young men need to give up is bad hygiene. Growing up, you're supposed to learn how to take better care of yourself with each year that goes by. By the time you're a young man, you should have solidified having good hygiene, getting haircuts, showering properly, wearing deodorant and cologne, dental care, nail care, and of course, skincare. If you're skipping these and you're in your 20s, you need to immediately work on your hygiene. As you get older, you start to realize that the way you present yourself, it matters. First impressions especially, being clean, well groomed, having clear skin, it shows discipline and self-care. It signals that you pay attention to detail and take pride in the way that you present yourself, making an immediate positive impact on those that you meet. Remember that skincare routines aren't about vanity, they're about health and self-care. Establishing a skincare routine in your 20s, even a simple one, is gonna benefit you the long run. It's about taking proactive steps to prevent skin issues that come up later in life like premature aging, acne scarring, or skin damage. If I could go back in time, I would take way better care of my skin in my early 20s now that I've seen first hand the difference that it makes. Winter is just around the corner, as you can tell by my sweater, it's cold here in New York City, it's the most important season to take care of your skin and to make sure that it's healthy. Our sponsor Neutrogena has easy solutions for guys looking to establish a simple but effective skincare routine. The Skin's Vitals balancing duo comes with an ultra gentle daily cleanser. Great for you if you have dry or sensitive skin because it has a non stripping formula that washes away excess oil and dirt without over drying or irritating your skin. It doesn't strip away that natural moisture barrier that your skin is supposed to have. And it comes with a daily face and neck moisturizer, which is a lightweight formula with a multi vitamin complex that helps fight daily environmental aggressors like air pollution and dust particle. If your skin tends to get red, dry or uncomfortable, This is a really good product because it's such a lightweight formula that doesn't irritate your skin and their skin's vitals clear skin Duo comes with the stubborn texture cleanser which exfoliates your skin and clears stubborn acne by shedding those rough surface skin cells and revealing new smooth skin with visible results in just one week And it comes with the stubborn marks PM which you apply at night for less visible acne marks and to even out your skin tone in Just one week. You just need to apply it before going to bed every night It's great if you have acne prone skin and if you want to get rid of those frustrating acne marks that tend to linger What will make the biggest impact on your skin the way that it looks the way that it feels is really how Consistent you are with your skincare routine a lot of men with acne think they can just wash their faces once or twice a week And that's it problem will just magically disappear That's far from true if you touch your face right now touch it go ahead You notice that it has oils on the surface, right? it's slightly sticky and it's supposed to be like that but that also means that dust and dirt particles will stick to your face Literally stick to your face. They will clog your pores They will give you acne and to fight that you should wash your face at least every night Ideally in the morning as well then apply the moisturizer to bring that hydration that moisture back onto your skin It's an ongoing thing and that's why it's called a skincare routine You need consistency for best results. Neutrogena has so many options to pick from but I'm gonna link the two kits that I mentioned in the description below They're available on Amazon which makes it so easy for you to shop and get it delivered today Or within the next couple of days to get started on your skincare routine And make sure that you have clear skin this winter one thing that a lot of men forget to take care of is their nails to be honest It's something that I neglected for years. It's embarrassing to say, but I actually used to chew my nails all the time It took me a long time to stop doing that and to start using clippers instead of my teeth Which is gross bad for your teeth bad for your nails I know I've learned my lesson just clean and clip your nails once every few days It's so easy it takes two minutes and pro tip women notice men's nails Remember that because they spend hundreds of dollars every two weeks getting their nails done and hours at the nail salon So they will look at yours and they will judge them and let's not forget dental hygiene having stained yellow teeth We're having bad breath We'll give people the wrong impression of you and these are easy things to fix for bad breath Just remember brush your teeth after you eat twice a day. Lawseeing is really what makes the biggest difference though. It removes those chunks of food from being lodged in your teeth and that's usually what smells so bad. And to whiten your teeth you can just use whitening strips every once in a while and whitening toothpaste to brighten that smile. Just don't forget to book those regular dentist appointments to keep your mouth healthy. The third bad habit that young men fall into and it crushes me seeing young men with this problem but it's reckless spending. One of the most immediate impacts of reckless spending is the accumulation of debt. Relying on credit cards or loans, finance a luxurious lifestyle without considering the consequences can lead to a mountain of debt that becomes overwhelming. High interest rates on credit cards, late fees, penalties that quickly spirals out of control making it very challenging to pay off that debt. And that can destroy your ability to achieve the financial goals that you've set for yourself like buying a home, starting a business, saving for the future. And besides that, it can and will impact your credit scores. A bad credit score affects your ability to secure a mortgage, loans, rent apartments, or even to get decent insurance rates in the future. So it doesn't just impact the present. It has a long lasting effect on your future by limiting financial freedom, hindering opportunities, and creating stress and instability in a lot of different aspects in your life.

We're so close actually, so help me out, it would mean a lot. Bad habit number four, obsession with girls. Obsession with girls can distract a young man from pursuing his actual goals, academic goals, career-oriented or personal development. thinking about being on dating apps, going on dates, that might need to you just neglecting other important responsibilities and opportunities for growth in your life. That obsession with girls is going to hinder your personal growth and your self-discovery, understanding who you are, not who you need to be for other people, who you actually are. So you're putting all of that time, all of that effort into seeking validation from girls. That's not a good place to be in. Another really bad habit that young men tend to have is is being anti-social, being scared of going out and talking to people. Being anti-social means you're bad at networking, you're bad at communicating with other people, and you have difficulty working in teams which can hinder your career growth. It can really hinder your next paycheck raise. So engaging with others allows for exposure, right? You're talking to other people, you're learning different perspectives and experiences. You're bringing in all of their knowledge and now you're actually putting it into your brain and learning from them. Every interaction is an opportunity for growth And if you're being anti-social, staying home, playing video games, you see how this all ties in together. It's just hindering your personal development, hindering your growth, and ultimately hindering your success. Develop those social skills, engage with others, build relationships. Those are vital components of personal development and success in your life. Just figure out your ideal balance, spending time by yourself and having me time, but also making sure that you're going out there and interacting with people and learning as much as possible so that you can use that knowledge later on in your life.

        "transcript": " Today we brought in four women from New York City to ask them if a man's income matters to them and to find out how much you need to be making according to women. And I'm not gonna lie, there's some surprises in there. Does a man's income matter to you? You have s*** to be after whatever. Like billions and billions of dollars more than me. I got a goal. Embarrassing, I feel like. My name is Kate. My name is Crystal Martinez. Hi, I'm Kat Burton. Hi, my name is Cassidy. Does a man's income matter to you? Depends how much we make together. Can't be like, I'm making $1.50, he's making $30, so that's not gonna work. But if it's more or less something similar, and sometimes he can get more, I can get less, so it can work. Now, as long as it's like, they're not working one day a week, and not giving a sh** about. What? Especially me, an after I'm a performer, I'm not raising in the bank bills like you have to, you have to accept the small paycheck sometimes to get the big one. I don't really care. If we have a conversation about the things that we want to accomplish within the household, you want me to take up more of the bills because I'm making more money than you are. Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. Or I handle the mortgage, you handle the utilities and light bill, gas bill, whatever it bill. That's smaller than the mortgage, then I'm fine with that. Depends on the type of conversation we have and the things that you wanna do and the things that you wanna provide. Do you care if your partner makes less than you? Okay, so first of all, that's the question I've never been thinking about before I moved to the US. Because for me, I always made a good money. I was like, okay, whatever you make, it can't work. But once I moved here, I realized that here you have to think about. Whoop, whoop, here I come. So yeah, for now, for me, living in New York, it matters. I want them to be well off, you know, but they don't have to be like super rich, you know, not like that. But I want them to be able to support themselves, like, you know, yes. I know that someone has to be making like billions and billions of dollars more than me. I want to live like a comfortable life. I'd like eventually like grow to that like I'm 23. It depends on the outlook you see yourself as. If you want to be a provider, you will have to have some type of income to support the title. Because you have an ego. I know some guys don't like when the woman pays for a date or just pays in general. So I would say yeah, it matters because if you don't want me offered to pay for something and you see yourself less of a man, then I would say income matters. What's the minimum income that you would accept for your partner? I can say 60, 70 the minimum, but it completely depends on the lifestyle and everything. So it can be, so I'm not going too much, I'm not going extreme. So suddenly it could be. There's like very minimum, like the lowest one I would say. You know, I guess maybe like 60, maybe thousand I think, okay. I'm trying to think like, I wish to I'm making here. 30 would be fine. Yeah, living in New York, that's probably as low as you can go. So we'll stay there. Damn. Okay, so, this opinion is if we're married and have a family, I would not accept anything less than 50. What do you think the average men's US salary is? Like if we covered all the US, I would say probably 60. Yeah, I could say that because the country's too big. Probably like 70. What if I told you that it's less than 40,000? Really? Oh my goodness. All right, well, you know, that goes out the window. And I'm not like money driven. So that doesn't actually matter to me, but like, you know, but again, if they have a goal and their work enjoys it, that's fine. Six, five. What if I told you that it's less than 40,000? Really? Oh hell no. But like, what are they doing? Ha ha ha ha. Where are they working? Okay, that sucks, but that's okay. Cause I'm getting paid last probably. We'll make it work. We'll figure it out. Who? Honestly, I think the average is 55k. What if I told you that it's less than 40,000? Wow. And that's usually my answer. I'm fine with 40k if, emphasis on if, you want to increase that salary. If you wanna increase, then we are good. Is it okay for a guy to split a bill on the first date? Can I say the word s***? Yeah, sure. If he wants to have s***, we'll be out there whenever, no. And I understand the meaning why they want to split. And it's kind of reasonable, especially when you're like actively looking for something, somebody. You go into date, like day every day, three, four times a week. And especially if you go to the good restaurant, maybe it's really a lot if you pay for everyone you invited. So it's kind of makes sense. I can't believe I wouldn't go on a second date with them. I wouldn't, I wouldn't feel very good about that. I feel like as a guy, if you're taking somebody out on a date, you should head, especially if you're taking that person out. I think just one-on-one etiquette and day-day, you know? I wouldn't care. He took me out on the date and he took me to a really expensive spot and then he asked me to split the bill. I was like, maybe I wasn't expecting that, but maybe give me a little warning. Like he's like, all surprised you where we're going. And then I'm like dropping $200 on dinner for some reason. I would be pissed. I gotta go. Don't ask me out on no date if you want to split the bill. That's a no in my book. I can understand this is not the first date. This is like probably the third, fourth, and I asked you on a date. Then we just split the bill. I paid a bill. but first date, first impression. What about the dates after that? Let's say you go on a first date and he pays for the first date. The dates after that, is that something that you talk about? Is that something that you're okay splitting or are you going to offer? What's that like? That's also a good question. It's very depends on the person. So sometimes I will be happy to pay for the whole bill even on to split when it comes naturally. But I don't see like he's expecting me to give him my card. And when I don't see this in the eyes, when he like doesn't think I have to pay, that's not okay. But if it happens naturally, absolutely I do that. I've done this many times. It was okay after like on the second or third date, but it should be like very natural. And when I see that Justin K's, anytime he still can pay for me and he will be having to pay for me. If you're like in a relationship with somebody and you've been together for a while, like I guess that's normal. You know, it's not okay to just always put it on the guy because you know, it's there to just put things down the middle and be like, But, you know, at the beginning, as like a guy trying to like, woo the girl over, he should be pay. Yeah, I'd split. Or I think it's also nice to be like, okay, I'm taking you out and like, I'm paying for this one or vice versa. Or like, you got the last one, I'm getting this one. Or you get this, like, I'll go get a drink somewhere else or dessert somewhere, something like that. All about balance. Yeah, maybe, you know, cause we're still against knowing each other. But actually, no. Second date, you still gotta pay. Probably like the third, fourth, once and more comfortable. Then I would have mine paying the bill Or if we have that conversation, okay, hey look, I'm down today, I really wanna take you out. You know, I can only afford food for myself. Okay, I could pay my part. What age do you think a guy should have his own place? I'm like, I love this very like bubbly and hell, like fun and very outgoing lifestyle. Like when you don't plan your dates, when you're like, you know, you can go to the cinema and you can go to somewhere and just like, oh, let's go to your place. And you don't need to plan, like when my parents are going somewhere or something. It's like, it's like too many problems. I don't wanna do that. So I would say no. Absolutely not. I feel like a guy should just, you know, have their own place, you know? Like how can you date a girl and bring them back to your parents' house? How does that look? You know, it's like embarrassing. I feel like maybe if there was, I don't know. Like if my parents lived in New York right now, I don't think I'd want to live with my parents, but it's nice to like not have to pay rent. If you have a way to not pay rent, I guess I'm gonna be mad. But if you're like over the age of, I'd say over the age of like 23, 24, like get out of your parents' home, you know? With my age, I would. I would date a guy that lived with his parents because I do understand the struggle. And houses nowadays, it's a lot. And mortgage increased, you know, the house value increased, cars increased. So yes, I can date a guy that's still with his parents. You can be comfortable because now it's a problem."

        "transcript": " Most men think they can't look better than they already do. They might even think they're ugly and that there's nothing they can do about it. If that's you, then consider this the sign you need it to let go of those negative thoughts. It's time to look your best. Looking good has been linked to getting better job opportunities, higher quality dates, and other daily advantages. They even call it pretty privilege, but you don't need to be pretty to get this privilege. What you need is to look presentable, to look well put together. And today I'm showing you seven ways that you can enhance your looks almost immediately. Shakespeare said, eyes are the windows to the soul. But what if your eyes look red and tired? Not a great look for your soul. I spend a lot of time in front of my computer screen and that makes my eyes red and irritated sometimes. So I had to come up with a solution. Well, I had to actually come up with two solutions. Whitening eye drops. They reduce redness in the eyes caused by irritation, allergies or fatigue. That redness in your eyes can make you look sick, tired or even high on substances. Using these drops before a special occasion like a date can help make your eyes appear wider and more refreshed. enhancing your appearance almost immediately. I like to use eye drops before leaving my apartment to go out at night, whether I'm meeting friends, going on a date, or a business meeting. It also has an effect that not a lot of people mentioned, but it physically makes me feel more awake. It's refreshing, it gets me energized. You can find them on Amazon or any drugstore. The second solution I found to this redness issue is to wear blue light blocking glasses while I'm at home, especially if I'm looking at all my screens, whether it's a phone or a computer or TV, it makes my eyes less tired and irritated after a long day of work. Now that in combination with the eye drops is the best combo to make sure that your eyes look a lot better instantly. Next, use facial hair to create an optical illusion of a sharper jawline and masculine face shape. If you have facial hair and it's messy, crooked, or uneven, it will make your face shape look uneven. According to science, beauty comes from symmetry. Anything that is symmetric is considered more beautiful, more attractive. And the reality is that the majority of our faces are not perfectly symmetric. It's pretty much impossible to achieve that. But you can get pretty close. And as men, we have the advantage of being able to use facial hair to create an optical illusion of a more symmetric face and the more defined jaw line. This is especially helpful if you have a round or oval face and you want to widen your jaw line to achieve that strong masculine look. I figured out this appearance hack early on and I clearly saw that it enhanced my face shape and it was hard to give that up. And if you're not subscribed yet, welcome.

Exfoliating just means using a scrub, a product that essentially lifts up and removes flaky old skin to reveal brand new young skin cells. These products tend to have a sandy texture, usually microbeads of some kind, that physically scrub away all of these dead skin cells. I use this scrub here and my skin immediately looks and feels better and most men skip this important step in their skincare routine, don't. This is arguably one of the most important steps to ensure that you have acne free, clear and smooth skin. The secret though is to not use it daily. You have to stick to two times a week otherwise you'll overdo it and irritate your skin. One thing I want to bring up is that stress is a big reason for visible skin issues. Being stressed out can completely change the way that you look. from dark circles to pimples to hair loss that can all be caused by stress. If you're feeling stressed alone or you just need to get things off your chest, our sponsor BetterHelp makes that so easy and I always say this, men can and should talk to a therapist. It's not a sign of weakness, it's the opposite. It takes strength and confidence to take action and talk to someone. It's a powerful tool for men who want to become the best version of themselves. BetterHelp connects you to a therapist, specialized in whatever challenges you're going through, whether it's social anxiety, building meaningful relationships, or you just need to talk to someone to ask questions without being judged. You sign up online and schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to sit in an awkward waiting room. This is discreet. It's judgment free and on your schedule. If you've always avoided therapy, I just want to give you two main reasons to try. One is learning more about yourself. Think about this. How long do you spend thinking about your emotions, dissecting why you feel a certain way? Probably not that long, right? We tend to suppress that. Most men do. Therapy helps you understand the core of your emotions. A lot of times we feel stressed or lonely because of unresolved issues from our past. Maybe you got rejected by your high school crush and that hurt you and since then you've always been anxious or too nervous to approach other girls. And you would be surprised at how common that is. In therapy you'll be able to discover those issues which allows you to then address them and move past them. And two, therapists aren't just random people that you're talking to, they're professionals. They can offer insights and perspectives that friends and family might not. Look, I'm not a dumb guy and before therapy, I always thought, I don't need to talk to anyone. Why would I need to, I can just think about it and figure it out on my own. I thought I had it under control, but my therapist brings up points that I wouldn't have thought of. And just that by itself, being able to hear a point of view that you wouldn't think of, it makes you go, you know what, that's a good point. You can always stop if you don't like it or swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which BetterHelp offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. Just hear me out on this one, be open-minded, click that first link in my description. It's betterhelp.com slash Alex Costa and you even get a discount on your first month. Four, instantly hide any skin imperfections with a tinted moisturizer. Most men don't know this. And the majority of men who have heard of it have never even tried it. And I can confidently say you're missing out. A tinted moisturizer is exactly what it sounds like. It's a face moisturizer that also has a slight tint to it. And what that does is once you apply it to your face, it will hide any skin imperfections like pimples, blackheads and sun damage. What I like about tinted moisturizers the fact that it's not perfect. It's not like a heavy women's makeup that just covers everything. It's a slight tint. A blurring tool that will blur in perfections and make them harder to notice. I'm wearing it right now and it's imperceptible even in person. I'm going to link the one that I use in the description of this video. 5. If your hair has no texture, you're missing out on an easy way to look more attractive. Hair texture gives your hairstyle more shape. It makes it more interesting. If you don't know what texture in hair looks like, it's these strands of hair that come together creating these lines and overall texture within your hairstyle. In straight hair, you want it to look kind of like this. In curly hair, you want to enhance and define those curls to look like this. And even in shorter hair, you can define and add texture like in this French crop right here. Products that enhance texture and definition include sea salt spray, curl creams, and texture powders. Six is lower the inflammation on your face. Have you noticed that some days you wake up looking alert, energized, your jawline is sharp, no bags under your eyes, but other days you wake up with dark circles under your eyes, puffy cheeks, and you look tired. Not getting enough sleep actually leads to fluid retention. It makes the blood vessels under your eyes dilate, creating dark circles and puffiness. And there's an easy way to fix that. Get an ice roller. This device has a roller that freezes overnight, so when you get up in the morning, you can pull it out of your freezer and just use it to depuff your face, soothe irritated skin, and minimize pores. Focus on the area under your eyes and your jawline, which by the way can help with lymphatic drainage and reduce puffiness for a sharper jawline, and even your cheeks to constrict the blood vessels in that area, giving yourself the best chance possible to achieve hollow cheeks. Hollow cheeks have become one of the most desirable looks in recent times for both men and women. When you think of hollow cheeks, popular celebrities like Cillian Murphy, Angelina Jolie, or Timothy Chalamet come to mind. People with hollow cheeks have a more chiseled jawline and prominent cheekbones, and you can achieve that by lowering your overall body fat percentage. You can Mew as well. Mewing is the technique that places the tongue in the proper position against the roof of your mouth and behind your upper front teeth when the mouth is closed. And if you didn't know this, there are countless benefits to Mewing. It helps sculpt your face, chisel your jawline, reduce double chin, and it gives you your desired hollow cheek. So as you can see, there are multiple ways that you can sculpt your face to give it that more defined, masculine look. Next up, an immediate game changer when it comes to attractiveness is improving your posture. Slouching having your shoulders rolled forward and sticking your neck too far out can make you look like you're not fit Like you're not strong enough to hold your body upright that gives people the impression that you're weak or tired Here's what I recommend when you're sitting always bring your shoulders back if you keep slouching place a tennis ball between your back and your chair And don't let it fall. It's actually great practice And once you have that down then use a golf ball which is smaller Then you get rid of them entirely and just focus on keeping your back straight You can also get a posture brace that reminds you to keep your body up straight at all times. And when you're standing, imagine there's a string pulling up at the top of your head. That will align the rest of your body into place and ensure that you have a strong upright posture. And looking your best and being successful will start with your morning routine. I just posted this video right here that took me a week to shoot and edit. It's a movie and I'm so proud of it. Make sure to check it out."

        "transcript": " Can you be stylish and broke at the same time? I'm not gonna dance around this topic. The answer is yes. You don't need a fat wallet to have great style. In fact, some of the most fashionable men that I know are on a tight budget. It's not about the fancy logos or the hefty price tags. It's about creativity, confidence, and a whole lot of attitude. Being broke isn't a style setback. As a matter of fact, it can be a superpower, and I'm gonna show you why in this video. So if your bank account is down bad, don't worry, with these tips, your style doesn't have to suffer. And by the way, you might look at me now and think easy for you to say, Alex, you have nice things. Well, maybe you just started following me, but let me paint the picture here. It wasn't always like this. I didn't grow up with money. I was actually pretty broke. When we immigrated to the US from Brazil, my dad got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant. My mom was a cafeteria lady at my middle school. So we didn't have the means to buy nice clothes. Whenever my birthday or Christmas came around, I'd be so excited to get new clothes. And it would be one hoodie or a pair of sneakers that I've been wanting for a very long time. But guess what? It made me so happy to get that one hoodie or the pair of shoes that I've been wanting for so long. And that also meant that I took such great care of those things. I couldn't afford to get new ones, so there's no chance that I'm getting my clothes dirty or stepping into dirt with my sneakers. I knew that if that happened, that would be the end of it. I would never get a new pair. That's why my things were always in perfect shape. Everything looked new. So trust me when I say, this is all coming from personal experience. And the first reason why broke guys can have more style than rich ones is, When you have no money for new clothes, you have to get creative with your current wardrobe. You don't have the means to buy new clothes, to change it up all the time. Limited resources actually encourage innovation. So when you're broke, you become a master of mixing and matching, transforming basic pieces into stylish looks. You have no choice but to experiment with combinations of layering your tops and bottoms, using different textures to your advantage, and perfecting your ability to style unique outfits that others might overlook. This creativity not only gives you a distinctive style, but also a deeper understanding of fashion, emphasizing personal expression over material wealth. Basically that tight budget sparks a sense of creativity that just gives you an edge. Rich guys would just throw money at the problem, right? If they don't have an outfit for a party, they would just buy something last minute and because it's expensive, they think it's stylish, but a lot of times they're absolutely wrong. That's literally why quiet luxury has been more and more popular recently. The old money aesthetic doesn't include any big logos and monograms, it's stealth wealth. not loud and obnoxious like these guys, I guarantee it's not stylish. You throw a bunch of logos together and call it a day. Anyone can go into credit card debt to do that. Not many guys can make a hundred dollar outfit look good. When you don't rely on logos, you have to put effort into the actual styling of these affordable pieces. And that takes practice. It takes creativity and it shows that you have real personal style. When you're broke, you also be smarter with what you add to your wardrobe. You're not gonna just go buy a bunch of random crap just because you have money to blow. Anytime you buy something, it has a purpose. It has a meaning. You're intentional with your purchases. You know that if you're gonna spend your hard earned money on something, you better wear it and you better get your money's worth. You're gonna take your time doing research to find affordable but stylish brands that don't break the bank like KuFandi. This long sleeve polo that I'm wearing right now is from them and if you had to guess how much this costs, what would you say? Would it blow your mind that it's only 30 bucks? $30 with free shipping, wild. And I'll sweeten the deal with a 30% off code because Ku Fendi sponsored today's video, which I think is a perfect match. It's an affordable brand that looks great and that will make you look like you spent $100 even though you didn't spend a third of that. And their fall collection is amazing. They have the long sleeve follows, they have quality sweaters like this cable knit sweater here that has that cozy fall holiday vibe to it. Of course, with no big logos, just a stylish piece that fits well and looks and feels way more expensive than it really is. These tops, they all fit into that very popular old money aesthetic. So you can wear them with chinos for a smart look. You can throw some sneakers on to make them a little bit more casual, but still look like a million bucks. And I'm a fan of this green sweater too. I like the way it fits. I think the color is beautiful. This is $27 before our 30% discount, and that is crazy. And I know sometimes when you think of affordable fashion brands, you might associate that with bad quality. So I got some detailed shots of the color, the buttons, the zippers. So you can see that these are well made. They're not gonna fall apart when you're wearing them. Plus they have a ton of other items on their official website and on Amazon, which is so convenient with a free next day delivery if you have Prime. Now just to note that to get the 30% off, you need to shop on their website using my discount code Alex09. I'll leave a link to their website in the description of this video and I'll also link these pieces that I showed you to make it easy for you. So you don't have to go search you on their website. Just check out the description of this video. As I mentioned in the beginning of this video, I was broke. I was broke pretty late into my 20s to be honest. It wasn't until I got a job at Google in 2015 that I started making money. Before then, I was in debt. I was 27 years old when I got that job by the way. So it was pretty late into my life. My entire life, I took care of my stuff. I wiped my shoes after wearing them. I washed my clothes very carefully so the colors wouldn't bleed or they wouldn't shrink. I took care of my things so they would look better for longer. I knew that I couldn't afford new things. A wise man once said, the less you have, the more you appreciate. That's me. I've always been very particular with keeping my things very clean and in perfect shape and being very careful not to lose anything. It's ingrained into my brain because of those fast experiences. So when you're broke, you develop these habits to preserve your things, to ensure they look good for a long time to come. As opposed to guys with a lot of disposable income. They don't care if their shoes get dirty, if their shirts shrink or get all wrinkly. They don't care if they get deodorant stains on their shirts, it's just another shirt, regardless of the price. This is what I meant when I said that being broke isn't a style setback. It can actually be a superpower. It pushes you to develop these habits. And you can still keep those habits later in life when you figure out your career and you start making bank. And when you do start making bank, well, you might not even want to wear designer brands anyway. Just look at Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos. They don't care about wearing expensive designer. They choose to wear simple outfits that aren't loud on purpose. Confident guys don't rely on flashy style to make a statement. They're secure in their status and their accomplishment. The simplicity in their clothing choices emphasizes that inner assurance, right? Which actually makes a really powerful impression. They understand the value of investing in quality over quantity rather than, you know, just splurging on a bunch of trendy but very short lived fashion items. I don't want you to be broke. I just want you to know that if you're broke right now, you can still dress up. as well and have personal style. Don't be discouraged, get creative, have fun with your outfits and people will notice."

        "transcript": " A 2021 study showed that one in every three Americans reported serious loneliness, with respondents saying that they felt lonely frequently or almost all the time. It's hard to believe knowing that we're living the most interconnected era of civilization. We all have phones so we can contact our friends and family at any time. We have the internet to interact with our loved ones and we are constantly engaging with strangers online. So why are people so lonely in this day and age? Well even though it's easier than ever to get in touch with people online, it's become harder than ever to make connections in real life. Social media can actually make loneliness worse. When we see other people's lives on Instagram or TikTok filled with fun and excitement, it can make us feel like we're missing out, like we're doing something wrong. Like they're having all the fun and you're a loser, you're sitting at home by yourself and that makes you feel even more lonely. I know you're used to seeing videos about fashion and self development here on this channel and I love shooting those but this is a topic that comes up daily in my life. I get messages from guys all over the world asking me how to make friends or how to get over a breakup because they're lonely, they're struggling and it pains me to read those messages. That's why I'm making this video. I want to help. We all have those times where we feel lonely or disconnected even if there's a ton of people around us. You can be at a coffee shop, right? There's a lot of people coming in and out, people working there, but that doesn't mean you feel any less lonely when you're sitting there by yourself looking at your phone hoping that someone comes over to talk to you. And guess what? That's probably not going to happen. So how do you fix that? How do you stop being lonely? I want to talk about that feeling, why it happens, and then a few tricks that have helped me when I felt that way, and trust me, I felt it too. When I first moved to LA, I didn't know a single soul out there. I moved out there for work, and I had to figure it out. I spent a lot of days alone in my apartment, in this beautiful city, so many amazing things happening around me, but I wasn't involved in any of them. At the time, I was ordering takeout for myself almost every night, going on walks by myself, just trying to pass time, hoping that I'd make some friends, but I'm not gonna lie to you, as much as I didn't want to accept it, deep down the truth is I felt lonely. Genuinely lonely. But the good news is with time and effort, things eventually took a turn for the better. Slowly but surely my social life began to change. I pushed myself to meet new people, to become more social and I put myself out there. Before I knew it, I'd built a strong social circle and today I'm so blessed to have a substantial number of friends that I can count on at any moment. Knowing they have my back is an incredible feeling and I'm sharing my story because I want the same success story for all of you. And real quick, if you're not subscribed yet, we're about to hit four million subscribers. And it would mean a lot to me if you hit that subscribe button below. Once you hit it, comment done, or let me know when you subscribe to my YouTube channel. And I promise I'll reply to as many comments as I can today. There's a lot of reasons for loneliness. One of the biggest reasons is technology. Working remotely, taking classes online. These seem very practical and convenient, but it also means that you don't get to physically interact with as many people on a day-to-day basis. And I've heard from a lot of friends that went from working in an office to working from home that they miss going into the office. Maybe not Monday through Friday, but it would be nice to go in two to three times a week just to get that face-to-face human interaction. You see, the problem isn't that we aren't connected. It's that the nature of our connections has changed. We often mistake those online interactions for genuine, meaningful relationships. They're very different. Scrolling through social media might give the illusion of being connected, but in reality, it can lead to feelings of isolation. Guys in their 20s also get lonely for one big reason. When you're a teenager, you're forced to have that human interaction in school. You talk to your classmates, you talk to your teacher. You put into a situation that makes it a lot easier to make friends on a daily basis. Same goes for college. Maybe you live in a dorm, everyone around you is the same age, has similar interests. But when you graduate, all of a sudden you stop seeing your friends. A lot of them move out of your hometown to pursue their careers or start a family and you're no longer around as many people with similar interests and similar ages. That's a big change. This means that now you have to be proactive in making friends. You have to make time for them outside of your busy schedule. Instead of seeing them every day in class, at lunch break, or hanging out after school, you have to actually reach out to them and make plans. Try to make your schedules alive. Make an effort to see each other. It's a whole different ball game. Be the social initiator. Take the lead. Text your friends with the time and place for everyone to meet up because if you sit around waiting for others to make plans, it might never happen. Be the connector and bring your friends together for dinner, for drinks on the weekends, or to watch the game. Another big reason for loneliness is the fear of being vulnerable. And something that can help solve that is talking to someone who isn't going to judge you, someone who you're not trying to impress, someone you're not worried trying to make them like you to be your friend. Talking to a therapist is one of the best things that you can do to learn more about yourself and to get things off your chest without feeling that social anxiety. And our sponsor BetterHelp makes that so easy. Let me address the elephant in the room. Man can and should talk to a therapist. I know it might sound intimidating but therapy is a powerful tool for self-discovery and just overcoming loneliness. Better help connects you to a therapist to specialize in whatever challenges you're going through. Whether it's social anxiety, building meaningful relationships, or you just need to talk to someone to ask questions without being judged. You just sign up online and then schedule sessions as a phone call, a video chat, or even messaging if you prefer that so you don't have to sit in an awkward waiting room. It's discreet, it's judgment-free, on your schedule. If you've always avoided therapy, I just want to give you two main reasons to try it. Hear me out. One is self-discovery. Therapy helps you understand the core of your emotions. A lot of times I feel lonely because of unresolved issues from the past. Maybe you try to make a friend at school, they made fun of you, and you got scared to ever try again. And you'd be surprised at how often this happens. This is common. In therapy, you'd be able to discover all those issues which will allow you to address them and move forward. And two, therapists aren't random people. They're their professionals. They can offer insights and perspectives that friends and family might not. Look, I'm not a dumb guy, all right? But before therapy, I always thought that I didn't need to talk to anyone. I had it under control. But my therapist brings up points that I wouldn't have thought of, and just that by itself, being able to hear a point of view that you wouldn't normally think of, it makes you go, you know what? That's a good point. Maybe that's why I've been having a hard time making friends. And that is so worth it. And again, you can always stop it, if you don't like it, swap to a different therapist if you don't like your first one, which better help offers free of charge if you're not happy with yours for whatever reason. So hear me out, be open minded with this one. Click that first link in the description. It's betterhelp.com slash Alex Costa and you even get a discount on your first month. But therapy is just one piece of the puzzle. Building meaningful connections requires effort. Something most people don't realize is that real and meaningful connections. It's all about quality, not quantity. It's not about having a big number of friends, but having a few genuine ones. So invest your time and energy into relationships that have that healthy two-way street. You both contribute to that friendship. You both provide value to each other. That is the best type of friendship. You don't want to be the only one giving value. Or vice versa. Don't reach out only to ask for favors. Hey, can you help me move? Hey, can you help me with this project? That's fine to do it once in a while, but when the time comes, you need to do the same for your friends. And I'd go one step further. Offer help. Offer value without even waiting for them to ask for it. Real meaningful connections. They usually stem from shared interests, but you don't know what shared interests you have until you've mentioned them to someone. So if you're just going through small talk with people about the weather, traffic, that's not gonna get you anywhere. The strategy that I like to use is to cut through the BS and just try to learn as much as possible about that person that I'm talking to. That way I can find out pretty much instantly whether or not we would be good friends. This next reason for loneliness, you know, people think this stuff is cringey, but I guarantee that it's not. It's actually crucial to practice self-compassion. Being kind to yourself. If you're always having that negative self-conversation, right, in your head, like, oh, I don't have friends because I'm not cool enough. I'm not smart enough. I'm not handsome enough. I don't make enough money. Then yeah, who wants to be around that negative person? You don't even wanna be around that person, do you? Understand that it's okay to feel lonely sometimes. Use this feeling as a jumpstart for self-improvement. Pursuit your passions, work on becoming the best version of yourself, and you're gonna naturally attract people resonate with the real you.

        "transcript": " The amount of messages I got from you asking me to shoot this video was insane. So as requested, here's what's with my iPhone 15 Pro. And there's tons of new features that I love about the new phone from the new look to the new customizable action button on the side. So I'll show you how I set mine up, what case I decided to use, and my favorite apps at the moment, including the dating apps that I've been using now that I'm single. I got the iPhone 15 Pro in natural titanium 512 gigabytes and I was set on getting the one terabyte, but then Apple announced the new larger iCloud storage So I upgraded my iCloud to six terabytes and I went with the 512 instead of the one terabyte. I also got the same phone, but in blue titanium and 256 gigabytes, which will be my work phone. Natural titanium for everyday use, and then the blue titanium to shoot the majority of the videos that you see on my Instagram, TikTok and YouTube short. And I thought I was gonna like the natural finish better, but honestly, when I got the blue phone delivered just yesterday, I think I might like it even better. To be honest, the natural finish looked better online. In person, I really like the edges of the phone. They have this metallic quality to them that look really great, but the back of the phone is almost like an off-white or like a really light tan, like gray, which isn't what I was expecting. With the blue phone, they were able to match the edges and the back a little closer together, so I think it's a better colorway overall. If I had to choose one, I'd go with the blue. The weight of the phone actually really surprised me. It is so much lighter than the previous version that I had, which was the 14 Pro. Now, one of the biggest changes to the phone itself is the new action button, which is customizable. And by default it's set to silence your phone, but if you go into your settings you can change it and you can turn it into a shortcut for focus mode, camera, flashlight, voice memo or magnifier. You can also customize it to open any app you want which is nice if you use one app more than others like Gmail, Spotify or Shazam. For my personal phone I kept it as a silence button just because I tend to change that setting a ton throughout the day. For my work phone I actually chose it to open the camera since it's the main purpose of this phone and specifically I actually chose it to go straight into video to streamline that process. I can just long press the button and it instantly goes into shooting my video. And if you have an iPhone 15, I'd love to know what your action button does. Let me know in the comments where you customize yours to do. The other big physical update to the phone itself is the change from lightning to USB. I know Android users are rolling their eyes right now. I know, I know, but this is big for the iPhone, right? The only issue is that I can't really get rid of all my lightning cords because I still have to charge my AirPods Pro and Max. But looking ahead, it will be nice when I can to ditch all of those lightning cords and carry your only USB-C cables in the future. The case that I'm using on my natural titanium phone is from RhinoShield and it's cool because it protects the phone without covering the back. I also got a few options from the brand Spigen. Not sure which one I'm going to end up using on the blue phone yet, but I do like this techy looking one. Since this is my work phone, I think it just makes sense. I also always like to add a screen protector to my phones. To make sure the screen doesn't break or scratch, I highly recommend you do the same. Moving on to my lock screen, I have this sick photo of an Aston Martin bulldog. I have quick access to the weather, Spotify and Shazam. On my home screen, I have the apps that I use the most and specifically I actually try to put my apps that I use the most down here. So it's easier to reach with my thumb. That's been my strategy for years. I don't know if anybody else does that, but I just feel like it's super helpful. And it makes it easier for me to reach those apps that I use a lot. So down here with Easy Reach, we have apps like Instagram, we have TikTok, we have X, we have Snapchat, And of course the newest one, Threads, which I've been enjoying. I think Meta had one of the most successful app launches ever with Threads. We also have the Zero Bond app. Zero Bond is a membership club here in New York City. It's a really cool place that I like to go to for dinner, for drinks. If someone comes to New York and wants to meet up, this is usually where I'll take them because it's an upscale, exclusive place. It's perfect to network or to go on dates. One of the apps that I use daily is Woop. I'm obsessed with being healthy and staying in shape, so I use it to keep track of my workouts. If I click on today's workout, for example, you can see what I did. I did leg day. It was a tough day. 164 total reps. These are the exercises that I did at the gym. It also tells me how long I worked out for, how many calories I burned, what my heart rate was during the workout, and a bunch of other very detailed information that's super helpful if you're trying to be in great shape. Whoop is the video sponsor. And if you start looking around, even on TV, you're going to see so many people wearing a whoop. like Cristiano Ronaldo, Patrick Mahomes, and so many others trust this fitness tracker because it truly is the best. You can see that my sleep wasn't so great last night. I actually went to bed late because it was a Friday night. So I went out for drinks, but it shows me that I got six hours and 46 minutes of sleep. It shows me what kind of sleep I got. And it even tells me that I woke up 1.8 times per hour, which is within my 1.2 to 1.9 range. I do wake up a lot at night, but it's always good to know what your sleep data looks like. If you want a free whoop fitness tracker, and trust me, you do. Then check out the first link in the description below and get the device in the first month free of charge because you're a part of the YouTube family. And when you get yours, join my team so that we can compare stats. We have about a thousand people in the community and I'd love to see you there. I post on Instagram and TikTok almost every day. Lately I've been having a lot of fun with these fashion tips, teaching men, teaching you how to look your absolute best. That's my purpose on social media. And we're close to two million followers on Instagram which is absolutely insane. Thank you so much for the support And for the love, it means everything to me. I like to create these folders here in the bottom with similar apps. For example, media has YouTube, YouTube studio, so that I can manage my channel. Spotify, Audible, F1, Netflix. And when I go into photos, I have all of my editing apps like Lightroom, Facetune, so I can easily edit my photos and post them on the go. In finance, I keep all of my credit card, bank, and crypto apps. Keeping track of my finances is extremely important to me. If you know my story, then you know that I don't come from money. And having the means to invest itself is a blessing, but it also means that I have to be very detail oriented and keep track of my finances to make sure that I'm good. I do also travel a lot and I keep those apps all in here for easy access when I'm traveling. On the second page, I have apps that I still use, but not as often, maybe a few times a week. Like Uber Eats, Amazon Yelp, Zillow. And I love this Google widget right here. It's so easy to quickly search for anything that you want and I also love how it looks. All right, like I said, I'm single now. So that means I downloaded some dating apps, okay? I have Hinge, Teleport, Raya, and Tinder. I don't use Tinder to be honest. I downloaded it, but it's not as good in New York City. The quality, let's say, of the matches are just not great. These other three, that's where it's at. Hinge is by far the most popular one. That's where you're gonna find the most people. Teleport is the most exclusive one, and it's available only in New York City at the moment. It's a matchmaking app, and it's pretty cool actually. They set up dates for you, according to your specific interests. They find other members who they think would be a good match. then they actually book you a date, which is really cool. Raya is also somewhat exclusive. You have to apply and then their team decides manually whether or not you should be accepted into their app. In general, I'm not a huge fan of dating apps, all right? Just because they're time consuming and I prefer to meet people in real life, out in events, at parties, through friends, or when I go out in the city. But I have met some pretty cool girls through these apps. So if you're single and looking to date, these are the ones that I recommend. But let me know in the comments. I'd love to know which dating apps you use and which ones have been successful for you. Something else that I wanted to show you because it did make a huge difference for me on the way that I use my iPhone is this quick access dashboard when you swipe to the left. I put a random carousel here, so you click on it and you kind of see some random photos of back in the day. I mean, these are super, super random, but I like seeing those memories. It's always fun to see. I also added my content calendar right here so I know which videos I'm posting that day, which videos I'm working on, the battery life for all the devices that I use, and then the top stories from Apple News so I can quickly glance at this and then just know what's going on in the world. And if you haven't yet, don't forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel. We're so close to hitting a huge milestone. Four million subscribers. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again in the next one."

        "transcript": " Picture this, you walk into a room and heads turn. Not because you're trying too hard, but because there's something undeniably attractive about you. It's not just about good looks, it's confidence, style, and a certain charm that's irresistible. An average guy decided to make a few small changes in his appearance, starting today, his life would be different in a matter of weeks. And in this video, we're diving into the secrets behind these subtle, but life-changing transformation. Making you more attractive, confident, and comfortable in your own skin. Stick around because these tips are about to change the game for you. One of the biggest but easiest changes that you can make immediately is start showing personality with your fashion sense. Your clothing is like a canvas, right? It allows you to express your individuality and make a statement without saying a word. And here's a secret. It's not about following trans blindly. It's about understanding your personality and translating it into your wardrobe choices. First, invest in pieces that resonate with your style and your persona. Are you formal and sophisticated? Or do you lean more towards an edgy or artistic vibe? Understanding your style archetype helps you create a wardrobe that feels authentic to you. Second, pay attention to fit and tailoring. Clothes don't fit you well, they don't look as good, no matter how much you paid for them or what designer brand they're from. Make sure they fit you well in all the right places. Next, don't underestimate the power of accessories. A carefully chosen watch, a necklace, or even a pair of sunglasses can elevate your outfit. I heard this quote the other day and it resonated with me because it's so true and its accessories are like like punctuation marks in fashion. They add emphasis and character to your look. They turn a boring old outfit into a proper look with lots of character. So my suggestion to you is experiment with different accessories until you find ones that resonate with your personality and enhance your overall style. Remember that your fashion sense is an extension of your identity. When you wear clothes that align with your personality, you project confidence, you project authenticity. So embrace your individuality, experiment with your style because when you feel great in what you wear, that confidence becomes your most attractive accessory. Number two is an absolute game changer. Find a passion and immerse yourself, whether it's painting, cooking, playing an instrument or mastering a sport, having a genuine passion. Not only makes you more interesting, but also boosts your confidence. And it makes you more interesting because now you have more in your conversational arsenal. In a conversation, you can always bring up this passion of yours and have something interesting to talk about on a date, for example, or with friends, something that you're genuinely interested in. And he makes you more confident and attractive because when you talk passionately about something you love, it's contagious, right? You use your hands, you get excited. You know what you're talking about because it's one of your passions. Number three is workout and sculpt your body. When you see someone who is in great shape, you think two things. One, this person looks good. They're maximizing their attractiveness by having defined abs, broad shoulders, and strong legs, right? But the second thought is even more important. When someone is in great shape, You also realize that this person put in the work. They work out every day. They don't eat bad foods. Their sculpted body is a reflection of their discipline, determination, and resilience. The sweat, the effort, the challenges they had to overcome. It's not easy to be fit. Otherwise, everyone would be ripped. So if that person did it, it was a lot of hard work and discipline which are all attractive traits. So I was a pretty skinny kid and my body completely changed after I started working out. I do wish that the technology that we have today was available when I started because nowadays wearable tech makes working out and taking care of my body so much easier. I absolutely love my Whoop, for example. I've been wearing it every single day for three years. You guys have seen me talk about it so much. Whoop is today's video sponsor, which means you actually can click the link in my description and get the device itself for free as well as the first month with that link below. Now, it tells me how many calories I'm burning every day, the exact time that I fell asleep and woke up, how many times I woke up at night. It helps me with all of my workouts. They have a new feature called Strength Trainer, which shows you exactly how to do each of the workouts, each of the exercises that you have on your list. So when you're in the gym working out and you're trying to use a machine and you don't know the right technique to lift those weights or use that machine, whoop has a video showing you exactly how to do it. Just pull up the app, watch the video, and it's gonna teach you how to do it. I even have a team, the Alex Costa team, with almost 1,000 of you guys there, and we have a friendly competition of who's working out the most, who's getting better sleep. It's just fun to see what you guys are up to. I'm gonna leave the team invite code in the description below. So once you get your whoop, join my team, let's compare stats and have that friendly competition. And if you've been on the fence, they reduced their prices recently, which is crazy, I've never really seen a company do that, especially a subscription company, they usually just go up. So check it out. Like I said, if you use that first link below, you get your whoop for free, as well as the first month, which is a great deal. Then just use the team invite code to join my team and we can all see our stats. It's that first link below. The fourth small change that you can make right now to appear more attractive is curate your social media presence. It's not about posting hundreds of photos to become an influencer or taking professional photos with the camera. It's about curating your online image thoughtfully. And I get that maybe some of you might ask, why should I care, Alex? Why should I post cool photos on the gram? We all know that's the first thing people check when they want to know more about you. You meet them, they get your first and last name, they go online and they check who you are. Why not showcase yourself in the best way possible? You don't need professional photos, you don't need to post a lot. Just don't post embarrassing photos of yourself doing stupid things like flipping off the camera. It's not that complicated. And if you've been feeling up to it, you can take it to the next level. Share your adventures, your passions, your achievements. A genuine social media profile can reflect your confidence and your positive energy, making you more attractive to others. Think of it as the highlight reel of your life. Show the good stuff, make sure people see that you are a cool, genuine guy who's doing a lot of cool things. That's all you need to do and don't post horrible photos of yourself. Next, find the ideal hairstyle for your face shape and your hair type. It'll completely change the way that you look. Once I finally discovered how to style my hair, what kind of haircut to get, and what suits my face shape, it was a game changer. Everything changed, my life changed. I had no idea what kind of haircut to ask for, what kind of hairstyle I should go for. I used to just buzz my own hair. I would literally just sit on a chair, look down, and buzz my own hair because I just didn't know what to do with it. Don't be that guy. When your hair looks great, you feel great, and that confidence is undeniably attractive. And by the way, I have an insane amount of hairstyle videos here on the channel that will help you choose the right hairstyle for you. If you wanna know what best hairstyles suit your face shape specifically, I have a video on that. If you wanna know the trendiest hairstyles for 2023, I have a video on that. And if you wanna know details about specific hairstyles, like a quiff, a middle part, or a curly undercut, I have videos on that too. So I'll leave some of those links below. Next, you need to work on communication. Work on being well-spoken and the tone of voice when you're speaking. The voice is a powerful tool, right? It can really impact the way that you're perceived by others. So work on being well spoken, being eloquent. Pay attention to your tone of voice when you speak. Are you mumbling and talking really low so nobody can understand what you're saying? Are you being really loud and annoying and obnoxious? Enunciate clearly, articulate your thoughts thoughtfully. Think before you speak. And of course not only that, but practice active listening. Listen to what this person is saying. Look at them in the eye, make sure you have eye contact while you're listening. Pay attention so that when you reply, When you answer a question, then you know exactly what the question was, you know exactly what they were talking about, and that will make you seem way more eloquent, way more interested in what they have to say too. I'll leave a link to the trendiest hairstyles of 2023 right here. Make sure to get your free whoop in the description below, and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " Being stylish is not as hard as it seems. 99% of men think that to be stylish, they need to spend a lot of money, they need to go to fashion schools, subscribe to get that monthly GQ magazine, or have a huge closet filled with expensive clothes. I'm here to tell you that's far from true. You can look significantly better by following the path of guys who already do it every day. Celebrities pay professional stylists thousands of dollars to create looks for them. Fashion influencers, they have the experience and the passion to carefully put together great outfits for their content. And you, you get to copy all of those outfits without having to spend hours researching with thousands of dollars on a celebrity stylist. All you gotta do is wear what's already been tested by these guys and you're gonna be on your way to being a fashionable guy. Now the five items on this list are guaranteed to make you look better. If you watch these videos, add these items to your wardrobe and make a few small changes to your look, your confidence will go through the roof because you're gonna be ahead of the majority of other guys. Let's get into it. First, the long-sleeved knit polo is a game changer in men's fashion. Why? Because you wanna look good without trying too hard. That's where the long sleeve knit polo comes into play. It's like your best friend in the wardrobe, especially in the colder months, comfortable, stylish, and incredibly versatile. And what makes it so special is the fact that it blends in anywhere on that style spectrum. Not too formal and it's not too casual. You can rock it for a work meeting and look sharp. You can wear it out to hang out with friends. It's one of my favorite items, especially in summer nights or fall season. The long sleeve adds that touch of sophistication without making you feel stuffy. Item number two is something that is a staple in men's fashion, a classy watch. And I get it, in the age of smartphones, you might think who needs a watch? Well, a classy watch isn't just about telling time, it's about making a statement. First off, it's a sign of sophistication, right? There's something undeniably classy about glancing at your wrist instead of your phone when someone asks you for the time. I know it sounds funny, but it's true. Plus, the right watch can actually be a conversation starter, whether you're at a business meeting, or a party, or a bar, a tasteful watch draws the right kind of attention. Also, it's about style. It's the finishing touch, the detail that shows that you pay attention to the little things. For example, have you ever noticed how a suit or a tux just feels way more elegant with a watch peaking out from under the cuff? It's that subtle touch that shows confidence and refinement. Now, I see a lot of guys wearing an Apple watch or a Fitbit instead of wearing a watch with a formal outfit and it doesn't look good. That's why I love my woop. I can wear it on my wrist for my workouts, for running errands, or when I'm at home and I can actually change the band to make it look however I want. I love the black with the gold. But if I don't wanna wear this, if I wanna dress up in something more formal and I wanna wear a watch, whoop allows me to do that. And to me, honestly, that's a deal breaker with any other wearable tech that just sits on your wrist and you can't really change it because I love my watches. Literally all you do is remove the whoop, which is extremely simple. Drop it for the longer bicep band, which is also literally takes two seconds. Slide it in and then you just cover it with your shirt and that's it. It's like it's never there. No one can notice. Now that let's me wear any watch I want without missing out on all of the data that you'd be missing out on if you had an Apple Watch or a Fitbit, because you have to take them off. And Moupe is today's video sponsor, which means you can actually just click the link in my description and you get the device itself for free with that link. Plus you get the first month free as well. It's a great deal and you get it with that first link below. Now why do I love my Moupe? Why do I talk about it so much? Because it literally tells me anything I need to know about my body. Literally from my body temperature to my oxygen levels, to my heart rate, how many calories I've burned, how many hours of sleep I'm getting, deep sleep compared to light sleep. And I've also been using their new strength trainer, which is a game changer. While I'm working out, it shows me how to have the best technique for that exercise with these detailed videos. So if you're ever in doubt, you can just check the app and you're gonna feel confident in what you're doing in the gym. A lot of guys don't know what they're doing in the gym and they feel embarrassed to go and try new things. So this really solves that problem. I use it literally every day to track my workouts and to keep me motivated. It's like having a personal trainer with me at all times, me tips and tricks on how to get in the best shape possible. I even have a team, the Alex Costa team, you should definitely join it when you get your whoop, which means you can see my stats and how I'm doing, how many calories I'm burning, what my strain and sleep look like, and we have this friendly competition going with me and you guys who watch my videos. And like I said, if you use the link below you get your whoop for free as well as the first month free, which is a great deal. So just get your whoop, use the team code below, join my team, we can compare stats, it's that first link below. Now number three, let's Let's go over the ultimate style weapon when the temperature drops and that is an overcoat. To me, it's not just a piece of clothing, alright? It's a statement of sophistication. I look forward to winter just so I can wear an overcoat. I just think it's the most elegant thing that a man can wear. By the way, it's timeless elegance. It's not something that's just trendy or popular right now. This has been around for many, many decades and it will continue to be popular. It will continue to look good for many years to come. You can wear it to a formal event, a casual dinner. You can wear it with a hoodie underneath and make it pretty casual. you can wear it with a suit underneath and make it very dressy. It's a coat with ultimate versatility. Now the fit is gonna play a huge role in this. Nowadays we do have a lot of the oversized, the baggier fit for the overcoats and I think it does look really well if you're going for an edgier look. Now if you're wearing it with a suit, if you wanna look well tailored and put together a classic look, then you go for something that's a little bit more conforming to your body. That's a little tighter. If there is one item that's gonna make you look good immediately, it's an overcoat. Guys, invest in a good overcoat. It's not just a winter essential. It's literally your secret weapon looking suave, even when the weather is anything but amazing. The next thing on this list is not really a thing. It's more of, I was gonna say a way of life. It's not really a way of life. It's a change that I recommend every guy make. Like I really believe that every guy should have longer hair at least once. I'm not even saying ponytail. I'm not even saying man bun, even though I've been there. You guys have seen it here on the channel. I'm just saying longer hair in general. Instead of having a bus cut, instead of grabbing a super, super short your entire life, let it grow, see what it looks like. Right now, the trend is to have longer hair. So if you've never had longer hair before, try to let it grow now. This is the perfect time to do it. My hair was actually pretty long up until three days ago and I just got it pretty short. But I really enjoyed the longer hair. I had it for about six months. I grew it up to be a middle part, curtains, and it looked really good. And as soon as I cut it, I was like, oh man, it looks so different. I kind of miss it. It's always like that. You always want something a little bit different. Change up your hairstyle. Try the longer hair. See how it feels. See how it looks. It's also a classier type of look instead of going with the fade which is more edgy a little bit younger. Right? If you're going for an old money aesthetic, you want something a little bit longer. If you're wearing an overcoat with slightly longer hair with like tussled hair, it just looks so good. Classy, timeless, and stylish. And my last point, if you're not convinced yet, longer hair brings more versatility. You can style it in so many different ways. If it's really long, you put it into a messy bun or a really nice clean bun. or you can have it long and wavy or you can straighten it. There's an entire spectrum of looks to explore. And if you have medium length hair, which is what I recommend you start with, then you can have a middle part, you can have a side part, you can have a quiff. You can go for a slick back. There are so many different things that you can do with your hair. So it just brings that versatility and it allows you to play more and really show your personality through your hair and short hair does not allow you to do that. Next item that will undeniably make you look way more attractive is a suit. Men in suits, it's just one of those things that women have found attractive since the beginning of time. You know, every time a guy throws a suit, as long as it looks good on them, as long as it's sharp, immediately people will look, what's going on with the suit? Is he going to a wedding? Or is he a really successful businessman and just wears a suit every day? Or is he just a really stylish guy who loves wearing suits? Suits really enhance a man's look. Picture this, you walk into a room, you're wearing a nice suit, and suddenly you're not just another guy, you're THE guy. People notice, they respect the effort that you've put into looking sharp and respect translates into confidence which can open so many doors for you. Now the cool thing about a suit and a lot of guys don't realize this is you can actually break it up and just wear parts of the suit. You buy a nice suit, it's great, you can wear it to formal events, weddings, to a nice business meeting if you have to wear a suit for work, and then you can also just wear the jacket with jeans. You can literally just wear the trousers with a nice Oxford shirt. There's so many ways to mix and match that suit into looks that are sharp and that will make you feel confident. And trust me, nothing beats that feeling of looking in the mirror and just feeling, just knowing that you look fantastic. That gives you that confidence that you need to go out there and crush it every single day. And last but not least, a great suit would just never go out of style. It's a timeless investment. Start with the classics. Gray, navy, black, those suits will literally never go out of style. So you're not just dumping your money into a fad that will just disappear into the sunset very quickly. By the way, if you are thinking about growing out your hair and trying different styles, check out this video here with the trendiest hairstyles of 2023. Make sure to get your free whoop with the link below and I'll see you in the next video."

        "transcript": " When a girl looks at you, the worst thing that you can do is immediately look shy, break eye contact and look away. That only tells her you're not confident enough to even look her in the eyes. Most men don't know what to do when a girl, especially an attractive girl looks at them. Lucky for you, I have a step by step guide on what to do in these situations. And we'll even end this video with some bonus tips on how to talk to this girl after she looks at you. Let's get started. Step number one, don't look away, maintain eye contact and stay relaxed. Let's say you're in school, like class or at a bar, a grocery store, you catch her looking at you, what now? Well, first things first, and this is incredibly important, don't panic. If you panic, she will be able to tell pretty easily. So this is what you do. You maintain composure, maintain eye contact. Here's the key, relax. It's just eye contact. She's not gonna burn you with her eyes. Keep your body language exactly as it was. Hopefully, good posture, confident, chest out. When you hold your gaze and show that you're comfortable, you're sending a strong message. And that message is, I can handle this. I'm not afraid of eye contact. And this might seem like it's common sense, common practice, but the reality is that 99% of men will look away. Don't be one of those guys. Confidence is attractive. So if you fail this first test, it'll be really hard to recover. Step number two, flash a genuine smile or smiles. Let your confidence shine through. A smile, by the way, is basically smiling with your eyes. It's a very subtle smile. You're not grinning, ear to ear, excited that she's looking at you. You're just showing her that you're friendly. A sincere smile shows warmth, friendliness, approachability. It tells her that you're open to conversation. Step number three, read her body language. When you notice her looking, keep eye contact, flash that genuine subtle smile, and then pay attention to her reaction. What is she saying with her eyes? Is she smiling back? Is she looking away? Is she giving you a playful look, or does she just frown and look away? Understanding these subtle cues can help you respond appropriately. It's not just about being seen, it's about seeing her too. If she frowns and looks away, it's pretty obvious that she's not open to connecting with you. That's her way of saying, don't come talk to me. That could be because she has a partner, She's not single, right? It could be because she's having a bad day. She doesn't want to talk to someone. Or it could just honestly be because she's not that into you for whatever reason. And that's okay. To be honest, the reason doesn't really matter. If that's her body language, respect it. Let it go, get back to whatever you were doing before and don't take it personally either. But if she doesn't really react or even better, she smiles back or you can tell that she might be interested, then it's time for step number four. Approach with confidence. If the moment feels right and you sense that she's open to it, take the plunge, approach her with confidence. Now one of the things that will exponentially increase your chances of this interaction going well is if you approach her and you smell great. If you're random fragrance that's sexy, she's going to be attracted to that. Now there's tons of fragrances to choose from, so how do you find the right one? With today's video sponsor, Sandberg, you can choose from thousands of fragrances, they send you a vial like this, which is enough for 30 days at least, then next month you get to try a new one. And this is by far the best way to try new scents and find ones that make you feel like a million bucks. And to test out expensive design fragrances for a month before committing to buying a full bottle. I've been using Scentbird for five years now and they actually just came out with a new packaging which looks beautiful. You can see that it's a lot more elegant, it's easy to use. All you have to do is twist the top and then spray it. They have thousands to choose from. From Dior to Versace, Calvin Klein, I mean Creed, Parfum de Mali and so many more on the website. All you have to do is go on the website, pick your favorites and they will send you those every single month. You just choose the order that you want them in. This month I got an Intenso by Dolce & Gabbana, Poor Olm, EdT by Versace, Sign by Mercedes-Benz, and Burberry, Brit for Men. It's always fun exploring different scents, right? It's one of the reasons why I love my St. Bird subscription. I get to try new fragrances all the time, instead of being stuck with one big bottle of fragrance that you might get tired of after a while. And St. Bird is already affordable. It's way cheaper than buying a big bottle of fragrance, but even though it's already pretty affordable, if you use my coupon code, Alex55off, you get 55% off, which means it's just a little over $8 for your first month. That's a crazy low price. So check out the first link in my description. Choose your favorite fragrance and impress her with how amazing you smell when you approach her. Don't be weird. Don't run up to her and scare her. Don't get too close. These are all common sense things that hopefully we don't have to go over. Just go up to her casually and we can get into step number four, which is start a casual conversation. Nice and easy, nothing weird, nothing creepy. It could be as simple as complimenting something that you genuinely appreciate about her. Maybe it's her smile, her style, or even her laugh. When you approach with a genuine confident attitude, it sets a positive tone for the entire conversation. Be yourself, stay relaxed, and let that natural charm shine through. I know diving into a conversation after just an initial eye contact situation can feel like walking a tightrope, right? It can be a little scary for a lot of men. That's why I decided to put together some great conversation starters to keep the momentum going and to make that connection meaningful. One of the easiest and most genuine ways to start a conversation is with a compliment. You could be something specific that you notice about her like cool necklace, right? Maybe her hair, her shoes, compliments that show that you've been paying attention are not only flattering but also they indicate that you're genuinely interested in her. But don't be fake, all right? Don't say that you love her dress or her shoes or her smile if you don't. Be genuine because real works and she'll pick up on it. In my opinion, the best openers are relatable and situational. A good example is let's say you're at the grocery store and she's looking at cake mix, right? You can ask her if it's her birthday, if she's surprising someone. You can ask her why she's going with chocolate instead of red velvet cake. It doesn't really have to be intricate or extremely funny. A lot of guys think that they have to come up with this really intricate opener. This is just a way for you to get your foot in the door and start talking to her. Once you break the ice, then it's a lot easier to start talking about other things. A pro tip I have for you is to not just ask that first icebreaker question about the cake, then immediately ask her for her number or ask her to go out with you, right? You need to ease into it. Take a little longer, establish that connection. She needs to see that you're a good guy with good intentions and that you're genuinely interested in what you are. So show curiosity about her interests or her opinions and what she's saying and ask open ended questions. Questions that can't be answered with a simple yes or no because otherwise that's going to be the answer. Open ended questions require longer more thoughtful responses which will give you a chance to keep that conversation flowing naturally. So you could ask something like what's the occasion for the cake? Right? You can't say yes or no to that. Do you add any secret ingredients to make it better? These are playful, open-ended questions that will get you both more comfortable to chat until at some point maybe you can ask her if she needs help finding something else from her shopping list or if she needs help baking or eating the cake. It's just a fun, light-hearted conversation that shows her that you're friendly. Then my man, it's time to get the digits, you know, and hopefully you'll be able to see her again. Who knows, you might even get an invite to the party and get to hang out with an attractive girl and have chocolate cake. That's the dream. And if you want to know how to stop getting rejected by attractive women, watch this video right here. subscribe and I'll see you next time."

        "transcript": " John Dutton, Thomas Shelby, James Bond and Tyler Durden. What do these characters have in common? They can all fight pretty well, but most importantly, they exude confidence in every way, from their body language, the way they speak, and their actions. Just a man trying to make an honest living. In a very dark world. But here's the thing, you don't need to be a fictional character to earn respect and to be confident. And then in this video, I wanna show you some powerful strategies to help you build that unbreakable self-assurance and earn the respect that you deserve. And first, you're gonna need to master the art of communication. James Bond, very suave, he's the British spy. He can charm his way out of any situation. His smooth communication skills are legendary. How does he do it? Why do we, as viewers, feel that confidence just oozing out of the screen when we're watching him? Well, he listens actively, he maintains eye contact, and he speaks with precision, whether he's negotiating a high stakes deal or just sharing a moment with a love interest. Heiler Dyrden's speeches gave him the ability to rally other people to his cause. He has really strong persuasive communication skills that inspire confidence in everyone listening. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. This stuff works. Effective communication is key to earning respect. Practice speaking clearly, maintaining eye contact while you're speaking, and using body language to show confidence. And remember, sometimes it's not even about what you say, but how you say it. It's also about how you look. you need to dress the part to be respected. If you're walking around looking like a bum, people will assume you're a bum. If you're well dressed, people will immediately respect you more. And I don't mean dressed up in a suit, by the way. That's obviously very sharp looking and I love suits. But I mean well dressed, no matter what your personal style is. You could be wearing a t-shirt, some pants, sneakers, but if you pull it off well, it doesn't matter. People will notice that you pay attention to detail, that you have a sense of style. And that's a huge win because first impressions matter. Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders. He understands the importance of dressing well, dressing the part. His style is impeccable. James Bond does the same, whether he's on vacation or at a black tie gala event. He knows how to look his best effortlessly. Even John Dutton, who's a cowboy, his style is completely different from other guys. But if you pay close attention, his style is actually pretty sick. It's well put together. Everything fits him well. It's not lazy and I absolutely love his iconic jacket. it actually makes me wanna dress like a cowboy and that's not even my style. So invest in a wardrobe that reflects your personal style, makes you feel like a million bucks because when you look good, you feel good and other people will notice. Now in today's world, there's one thing that these characters didn't really get to benefit from, but we do. This new technology gets people to respect you without them ever even meeting you in real life and that's social media. Nowadays, you can easily find someone's whole life online. You can look up their names and boom, You get their Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn. I talked about first impressions and this is by far the most important first impression that you can make. When people see your social media accounts, what do they think of you? Are you always partying, traveling? Are you funny? Are you well dressed? How many followers do you have? We live in a day and age where that matters. Having a following on Instagram, for example, can give you so many real life benefits. For example, first, you can set up your profile to attract the right type of partner that you're looking for. Showcasing your interest, your best side. It's a highlight reel of your life and it makes you look great. It's the perfect first impression. So it gets girls to DM you and you can take it from there. Second, you can actually use your Instagram to make a part-time or even full-time income. A lot of people don't know this. For me, this was life-changing. A lot of my income is currently generated through sponsorships that I get on Instagram. I work with brands like MasterCard, Creed, Patron and these brands pay me to integrate their products into my lifestyle and showcase that to my audience. It's an incredible business model and I'm very, very passionate about it. That's why I created the Influencer System.com. It's a system that you can follow to set up your Instagram profile and achieve the best results. Whether you wanna set it up to have a beautiful Instagram that gives people a great first impression or you wanna make some extra cash from sponsorships that could eventually lead you to quitting your nine to five job, which was what happened to me. I quit my six figure career at Google to do this full time. And within the first year of quitting, I made five times what I made at Google. It was the best decision I've ever made. I have over 45 videos showing you how I did it, what you need to do to achieve the same and how you can grow your following quickly. I know a lot of you are trying to grow your following, but you don't know what to post, when to post it or how. You can keep trying on your own and maybe someday one of your posts will go viral, but let's be honest, probably not. The chance is you're low. At least that's not what happened to me. It took me years of trying things, throwing things against the wall to see if something would stick. You can bypass all of that and learn from someone who's done it, who's made all the mistakes so you don't have to make them, and who's learned the way so you can follow it. And I continue to do it every single day. Check out theinfluencersystem.com and get started because one thing I can say for sure, the longer you wait, the tougher the competition, the harder it's gonna get. More and more people will learn about the earning potential social media has to offer. It's about to surpass the $300 billion mark by 2024. So this isn't small, this is huge. And I would love to help you take a piece of that pie home. It's the first link in the description of this video, which brings us to the next point of commanding respect, helping others. Being helpful and generous can actually earn a lot of respect. Just think back to the last time someone helped you when you were in a bind, right? When you were in a tough time. Maybe you needed a loan, maybe somebody helped you feel better when you were down, or maybe somebody helped you achieve a specific goal that you couldn't have reached without this person's help. When you think of that person who helped you, does it make you like them more, respect them more? It does, right? You now know that this person is legit, and you can count on them to help you when things get tough, and that's enough to earn your respect. James Bond is always in situations where innocent lives are at stake, and his priorities are very clear, protect those individuals. Thomas Shelby helps his community, protects his family, no matter the cost, and that's how he's so respected. And Tyler Durden just wanted to show people their true potential, even if he was pretty extreme with his methods. So provide value to others, help them, and they will in turn respect you. And if you ever need their help, they'll probably be there for you because they will remember all that you've done for them. This is how you build a strong network, your allies, let's say. You give without really asking or expecting anything in return. And remember that to be respected, you have to show respect. One of the best ways to earn respect is to show respect to others. Treat everyone regardless of their position, status, with kindness, politeness, consideration, Maybe it's the doorman in your building that you see every day but never really talk to, or the janitor at school who's always there but you've never even said a word to them. We tend to get numb to these interactions, right, and just brush them aside. But when you put down these walls and start looking around, you start to notice a lot of incredible people who deserve your time, attention, and respect. Thomas Shelby values loyalty and respect within his gang, above everything else. He even acknowledges the capabilities of his enemies, showing respect for their intelligence, for their capabilities. But they would never be respected unless they showed the most important thing on this list. And that is confidence. Confidence is a magnet for respect. And confidence can be shown in many ways. Sometimes it's something as simple as holding eye contact even during conflict or awkwardness. Thomas Shelby is a great example of that. Even when he's up against the most dangerous enemies, he doesn't back down. He maintains eye contact and shows through body language that he is confident in who he is. Confidence is unwavering. Whether he's diffusing a bomb, seducing a spy, or driving a high-speed car, it doesn't matter. His belief in his training, his intelligence, and ability to handle any situation is evident in his actions. Now, hopefully you don't have to diffuse any bombs, or go up against any dangerous criminals, but you can apply this to your everyday life. For example, when you're talking to someone, stand up straight with great posture. Listen to them, maintain eye contact. Don't be jittering, moving around too much, fidgeting. Being on camera so much, I've improved my body language a lot. In my first videos, I looked so uncomfortable. My body language wasn't strong. And the reason being, I wasn't confident. I just wasn't, I was nervous. Now I can shoot these videos in my sleep. It's second nature. Get comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. The more you do it, the quicker you adapt. So if you're uncomfortable talking to girls, guess what? Do it a hundred times until it's no longer an issue. That's how you build confidence with practice and with experience. And speaking of girls, if you wanna know why I think you should stop chasing girls immediately, I have a whole theory about that. Check out this video right here, and don't forget to go to theinfluencersystem.com if you're ready to take a piece of that $300 billion industry. I'll see you there."

        "transcript": " Stop chasing girls. I have a story to tell you and it might change the way that you approach dating forever. A friend of mine, let's call him Mike, spent most of his days chasing girls, swiping right, going on tons of dates. But as he spent more and more time swiping and chasing girls, he spent less time improving himself. He got some matches, he even went on a few dates. So he thought he was doing the right thing, putting all of his time and effort into looking for girls, spending money on dinner and drinks, but the conversations felt shallow. These weren't even the type of girls that he wanted to date. He was just desperate. Fast forward a few months and something pretty amazing happened. Mike decided to hit pause on the dating apps and all of that time that he was putting into chasing, swiping and going on these meaningless dates, he decided to invest into himself. He started working on his confidence, improving his skills, pursuing his passions and earning a higher income. And you know what? It was like flipping a switch. Suddenly he was attracting the right girls with little to no effort and the quality of these dates were much, much higher than before, all because he had more value to offer, which in itself is attractive. You see, when you focus on becoming the best version of yourself, you naturally become more attractive to potential partners. That's why self-improvement is crucial. What if you stop spending all of that time chasing girls and focused on earning a higher income? You'll be able to take the time that you were wasting going on meaningless dates and invest it into earning more, whether it's through a part-time job, a side hustle, or new business ventures. And in the long run, this is astronomically better than having a fun one-night stand. Which by the way, might not even happen, right? you could go on a date, spend money on ubers, dinner, drinks, and hope that maybe you're gonna get lucky. But the truth is, a lot of times you won't. And you put all of that time, money, and effort into a boring conversation over an expensive dinner, and you probably never see this girl again. Just look at how much easier it is for successful men to find good dates. Success brings financial stability and security. And it's just a known fact that most women are attracted to men who can provide for them and their potential future family. They desire a stable and comfortable life. So with financial freedom, you can bring her to nicer restaurants. You can go on vacations together. You can provide a better lifestyle for your partner. Plus, a stable financial situation reduces stress and financial worries within a relationship. And the truth is, attractive women just have a ton of options. And if she's choosing between two guys who are maybe physically similar, kind of have the same vibe, but one of them also offers financial stability, this guy has a big advantage. If you're struggling financially, what are you even doing spending that money on dates? Take this time, invest it into yourself. It's time to grind, it's time to figure out your life, your career, your future. A lot of you who watch my videos are in your 20s and it's the best time to climb up the ladder and set yourself up for success. You know what else it should be working on? Your communication skills. Being able to express yourself clearly and effectively is life changing. When you speak well, people stop and listen. You can keep a conversation interesting during a date instead of not knowing what to say next. So how do you do that? Well, read books or take courses on communication, practice at home with friends, and work on expanding your vocabulary. Something to note here too is that confidence plays a huge role in our communication skills. When you're confident, you just sound more sure of yourself. You sound better. So as you work on yourself, your confidence goes up, your communication skills improve, and you start to really see that compound growth. All by taking that first step and focusing on self-improvement. And then an important step in self-improvement is learning more about yourself, about your strengths, your weaknesses, your values, your goals, Being self-aware is very powerful because it makes your daily decision making way easier. You know who you are, you know what you like and what you don't like. You don't need to waste time doing things that you're not into. But being self-aware is actually harder than most people think. You actually have to work on knowing yourself and understanding what makes you happy, what your strengths are, what your weaknesses are. And a way to speed up that process to become self-aware is through therapy. Talking it out with someone who's not biased, who's not trying to sway you one way or another, they're just there to help you. And with BetterHelp, who sponsored today's video, You can find a therapist in a matter of minutes from the comfort of your own home without having to go to a clinic and sit in a waiting room awkwardly with other people. Their mission is to make therapy more affordable and more accessible. And let's be honest, most men don't talk about therapy. We don't like talking about it. For some reason, some even look at it as taboo. But if you think about it, you're literally just talking to a professional who has a deep understanding of human behavior. It's like consulting. Businesses consult with professionals all the time to grow, to increase sales and employee retention. And therapy lets you consult with someone who will help you understand why you feel a certain way, why you behave a certain way, that is their job. So all you have to do is go to betterhelp.com slash alexkosta, sign up, and they will match you with the right therapist. And let me say this, having someone you know is on your team who is listening, who is giving you sound advice is insanely valuable. You can talk about your relationships, your work, your friend group, your family, anything that you want an unbiased opinion on, That's when you talk to your therapist. And finding the right therapist isn't easy, right? You have to click with that person for it to work well. So BetterHelp allows you to easily switch to a new therapist at no additional cost if you're not 100% satisfied with your therapist, all without having to go through insurance, which can be a nightmare. You get the final say and you decide whether or not you wanna keep talking to that person. So if you're struggling, if you need a second opinion, or if you just want someone on your side to help you navigate life, check out betterhelp.com slash alexkosta and sign up now to get started. it's gonna be the first link in the description of this video. Now, one amazing consequence of not putting all of that time and effort into chasing and then investing that time into yourself instead is the fact that you can actually now have time to pursue your passions. Whether it's a hobby, like playing an instrument or working out more consistently or learning a new language or maybe even playing a sport, those tend to be the first activities that men give up when they start going on dates, right? We give those up so quickly, but I'm here to tell you that you should always keep those hobbies alive and that giving them up to make time so that you can chase girls is a horrible move. Having hobbies and interests outside of dating makes you more interesting, more well-rounded, and in turn, more attractive. So explore these passions, explore new passions, new hobbies. That is still considered working on yourself and building your skill set so that you can attract instead of chasing. One huge, and I mean huge benefit of taking this self-development path is that you get to put time into your physical health, into working out, getting into great shape, whether you want to gain muscle mass or you want to lose weight and lean out, how much better would your life be if you were in great shape? Would you feel more confident? Would you feel stronger? Would you feel more accomplished and proud of yourself? Those feelings can change the way that you see yourself. So when you look in the mirror and you don't like what you see, that crushes your confidence. Change that. Invest this time into building you, the better version of you. And it will be a much better investment than swiping on a dating app, hoping a girl will like you, even though you're out of shape and not confident. The chances of that happening are low. Here's the truth, when people ask, hey Alex, how can I get in shape? What's the right workout routine? Should I fast in the mornings? Forget about all of that if you're just getting started. All you have to do is show up to the gym, eat a decent diet, it doesn't have to be perfect. The best thing you can do is start building that habit of working out daily and cutting out all of that crappy food, candy, soda, fast foods, et cetera, cut it out and workout. You do that and you're immediately much closer to reaching your fitness goals. This video here goes over seven small habits that will change your life forever. And I highly recommend you check it out if you're serious about self-improvement. Also, make sure to subscribe if you learned something new from this video and I'll see you in the next one."

        "transcript": " There could be three reasons for rejection. The first one is you, the way that you present yourself, your overall vibe, your style, your posture. And if you pass this first test, then the second reason could be your approach. Was it funny and smart? Was it cringy and desperate? And if you pass that second test, there's a third reason, which is her. Is she available? Does she have a partner? Is she even open to talking to someone that night? Or is it girl's night out and she's fully closed off to any approaches? You can't control this third reason, but we can definitely improve reasons number one and two to give you the best chances of getting that number, getting the IG and stop getting rejected once and for all. The first mistake that most guys make is in the approach. You can't go in too hot. For example, if you approach a girl at the bar with a line about how you want to take her home, that's way too forward. Or if you use physical touch right away, it's probably too aggressive. Your goal in the approach is to break that ice, to open the conversation up and get her to engage with you. Keep it relaxed, keep it natural, respect her personal space and boundaries. The best way to think about it is to approach with the intention of having a nice chat, a good conversation, not with the goal of bringing her home. Remember, you shouldn't try to close immediately, which brings me to another very important tip. Be careful not to come off as desperate. I've seen so many guys do this, right? The bartender yells out, last call, you freak out because you haven't talked to a girl the entire night and now you're desperate. You go up to the first girl that you see and you say, hey, you want to go back to my place for a nightcap? She's giving off desperate vibes and it shows. You need to set the tone first. At least start the conversation with something a little bit more intriguing. Bring up something that's relatable to the environment that you're in. Talk to her about the drink that she's having, about the music that's going on, about what she's wearing. Don't act desperate because they are going to smell that from a mile away. Be cool, calm, collected. You're just having a conversation. And if it goes well, then yeah, you can try to close, right? You can invite her somewhere else. You can try to get her number so you can see her another night. The moment you're desperate to talk to a girl, it's all over. It's gonna make them feel like you're just trying to get some action. If you're out trying to find someone to talk to, don't wait until the last minute. Make eye contact. So many guys go wrong on this one. Before approaching, make brief eye contact. Do not break eye contact if she looks back at you. If you look at her and she looks back at you and you get shy and look away, you're gonna blow your chance. You look insecure and shy, which is the very opposite of being confident. naturally keep eye contact. She'll probably look away and this will show her that you're confident, that you're potentially interested and it's going to make the approach feel a lot more natural. Here's the truth. You should show masculine energy. If you're acting insecure, nervous, not confident, it's actually a turn off to them because most women want to feel feminine and they can't feel that way if you're not showing any sign of strength. Once you get close to her, there's one thing that might be a deal breaker or it might make her want to inch a little bit closer to you. Your fragrance, the way that you smell. I've said this a million times here on the channel, you need to make sure that you smell great. It gives you confidence because you know you smell good. You get compliments which boosts your self-esteem and of course it's attractive. You need a strong night out fragrance that you can rely on for these moments. Now this fragrance right here is actually a great scent for a night out. It's called S-Boy for Him and they sponsor today's video. Everyone has been talking about this fragrance all over the internet as an attractive scent for men that women absolutely love. Andrea from CurlySense called it a penny dropper scent. It even won an award is the best night scent of the year. It's made in France, it has 15 notes including iris extract which is 2.5 times more expensive than gold. It's a high quality scent and it projects really well which means you can spray a small amount of this and know that people around you will be able to smell you. Even the box is handmade with a school stand for a perfect presentation. You know I love it when brands go above and beyond with their packaging it just shows that they pay attention to detail. The scent itself is fresh sweet and has a caramel quality to it that makes it very seductive. It's an addicting scent which is what you should be looking for when you're choosing a night out fragrance right. The goal here is to get women to get closer to you so they can smell that amazing scent and hopefully get addicted to it as well and I think S-Boy for him does an amazing job at that. The bottle is made in Italy. It looks great with the cap being a standout for me. It really elevates the whole look of the fragrance and I would say that four sprays is more than enough with this one because it is a strong long lasting scent. It doesn't just wear off your skin like a lot of other fragrances. And of course I'm not gonna let you pay full price. If you use the code AlexCosta35 you get an extra 35 bucks off whether you're in the US or Europe it doesn't matter not only that but they're also having a sale right now for 25 bucks off which means you can double dip. You can combine the sale with my coupon code to get 60 off your bottle of Espoye for him. I'm gonna leave the link in the description of this video. But it's not Not just the way that you smell, right? You also have to look good. And I'll start by saying this, looks are subjective. And that's reason number three, right? That's on them. But you can control how you look. Whether you're going for a dressier suit type of style or an edgy street style vibe, you need to nail it. You need to do it well. If you want best results, you're going to have to put effort into your looks. Your appearance is one of the first things that people notice. And you and I both know how important first impressions are. It can 100% influence what someone thinks of you. We live in a world in which we're told not to judge a book by its cover. Right? That's the right thing to do. But the truth is, it will happen. And if you're walking around looking haggard in bad clothing and style, people will judge you. This goes for women you're trying to approach, but also business opportunities and even friendship opportunities. When you dress well, it lets people know that you pay attention to detail, which is an attractive quality in itself. People tend to associate someone who is well-dressed with positive qualities like success, competence, and even, let's say, cool. Chasing well is an attention magnet. That's why I talk about it so much here on the channel. It naturally draws people's, especially women's eyes to you. This is how you attract instead of chasing, which is a lesson that I think every man needs to learn. One really important point I want to make, and if there's one single lesson that I want you to take from this video is this one. Learn to accept rejection. And you'll be able to do that by, number one, having an exit strategy. The conversation isn't flowing, or if she seems disinterested. Have an exit strategy in mind to gracefully end that conversation. You can say something like, it's really nice talking to you, enjoy the rest of your night, and then walk away gracefully. Don't just stand there awkwardly if they turn away. And number two, who cares? That's the lesson. I lived in LA for 10 years. I've seen celebrities getting rejected right in front of me. Famous DJs getting rejected by someone in my friend group. It's not always up to you. There's always that third reason for rejection, which is her choice and her choice only. The sooner you realize that getting rejected is not that bad, the sooner you feel that scary weight of rejection off your shoulders. It's like unleashing a new you. Once you get rejected a few times, you kind of become comfortable with it. It's not as bad as it seems. And that fear of rejection tends to slow us down. It keeps you from going over there and trying because you're scared that she might say no. Again, who cares? It's not a big deal. Just accept that she said no, gracefully walk away, she wasn't the right one for you. It's not rejection, it's redirection. And if you're in your 20s, I have five important lessons that will help you navigate the next few years, which are crucial for your success. It's in this video here. Make sure to watch it. I'll see you again soon."

        "transcript": " So I woke up this morning and this is what New York City looked like. I swear this was the shortest summer of my life. It was gone in the blink of an eye and now leaves are falling off the trees. There's this cool breeze in the air and you're probably gonna be sipping on a hot chocolate soon enough just to keep your hands warm. Fall is here and it's time to get the right pieces to not only be stylish to season but also to stay warm and comfortable in these upcoming lower temperatures. It's hoodie season and I love it. A hoodie is a staple in any fall wardrobe. It's an easy way to stay warm, comfortable and stylish, but you have to wear the right type of hoodie. There are two types of hoodies that I recommend for the season. One is the oversized hoodie. And these tend to have a dropped shoulder, the sleeves are baggier and the torso is also roomier. I don't personally like the crazy baggy ones, but I do like my hoodies to be slightly oversized because you can wear them with a tee underneath, paired with cargo pants, denim or even a fashion forward baggier type of pant. Just a warning though that wearing oversized hoodies with skinny jeans would not be a match because it would make your legs look really skinny so you don't want that. That's why I also recommend a second type of hoodie, a slim solid hoodie. These tend to be great if your style is more tailored, if you like slim trousers, a slim hoodie will typically look way better than an oversized hoodie. I also like wearing slimmer hoodies as a layer underneath an overcoat or bomber jacket because they're not as bulky. If you're wearing oversized hoodie with another piece over it, you might actually end up looking a little too big, too poofy, so I'd be careful with that. By the way, I'm gonna link a few hoodie options in the description of this video, some oversized like this one from Abercrombie and this one from Ami Paris and then some slim like this one from my brand, Atos and this one from Banana Republic. Boots in my opinion are the unsung heroes of fall fashion. It's one of my favorite things to wear. As soon as it starts getting colder outside, I'm throwing boots on. Specifically, I like Doc Martens. They're timeless, which means they'll always be stylish. They come in a bunch of different shapes, colors and prices, so I'm gonna link some below. I really like these Bottega Veneta lug boots, but I understand they're not for everyone. They're big, they're bulky, they're expensive. I like them though, because sometimes I enjoy going full street style or being more fashion forward. Obviously fashion is a passion of mine, so I like exploring different styles. If you want something edgy, these are absolutely beautiful. I know they're pricey, so I'm gonna link a more affordable alternative below as well. Now I don't know if you remember, but back in the day, Timberlands were all the hype. I wouldn't wear them today, but I do own a pair of Moncler boots that have a similar appeal, and I love to wear them. I'll be wearing these a lot. Again, not for everyone, but I'm obsessed with these boots. Now, combat or military boots, they tend to be more popular in general. They're versatile, they keep your feet warm and safe from puddles, mud, or whatever elements you walk into. They're very stylish and most guys like to wear them. Now, I love boots in general because they elevate your look. They elevate your height, they elevate your style. It's a way to stand out in this sea of sneaker heads wearing the same hyped up sneakers, right? I feel like most guys just wear the same stuff nowadays. And in general, I'm just a fan of elevating my outfits to stand out slightly instead of blending in with the masses. Now, of course, this wouldn't be a fall as central's video without me bringing up my favorite type of jacket for this season, the iconic bomber jacket. And I'll tell you why every guy should own one of these. First off, the bomber jacket has a fascinating history. It was originally designed for military pilots and that heritage still makes it really cool and rugged looking today. It's a symbol of confidence and adventure. Bomber jackets are also incredibly versatile. You can pair one up with jeans and a plain tee for a casual look, or you can throw it over a flannel for a more sophisticated vibe. And my love for bomber jackets is well documented, well known, you've seen me wear them year after year here on the channel. So it's only right that after all these years wearing them, testing them out, so many different brands, it's only right that I launch my own bomber jacket. Say hello to the new ATOS Aero bomber jacket, which is available as of today. We wanted to make something specifically for you, the men who watch my videos. I kept to in mind throughout the entire design process. So the fit isn't this hyped up extra baggy fit. We kept that classic bomber shape and fit but added modern elements that will keep you reaching back into your closet to wear this jacket daily. Like the leather pull tab on the zipper, the designer grade hardware that you see on the sleeve pocket, the inner pocket that keeps your valuables safe, the triangular stitching detail for when you wear it unzipped and my favorite feature, the backpack straps. I know a lot of you commute to work or school So this lets you take off your jacket when you go from the cold outdoors to a hot steamy subway ride, or if the clouds open up and the day gets a little bit too warm to wear that jacket, you just wear the straps. It looks really stylish and cool and you don't have to carry your jacket in your hands or try to stuff it into a bag. It comes in two different colors, Onyx Black and the Sahara Sand. They both have a monochrome ATOS script logo embroidered on the chest, which is minimal but elevates the style. It gives it some flavor. We really went above and beyond with this bomber jacket. It's probably my favorite piece that we've ever launched and we didn't make a ton of them so they'll probably sell out. I say this because we're still a small brand and I would love for everyone to be able to get one but they're expensive to make so the stock is limited. I'll link it in the description below but it's atasaparel.com and like I said, they launched today. They're available right now. It's honestly a dream come true for me to just have my own bomber jacket so thank you so much for making that dream possible. And it doesn't end there. Today is a good day. We're launching the fall collection so that also includes the next item on today's list which is a flannel. I love the classic flannel with the plaid pattern. It's just rugged, rustic, and a staple for fall season. But the beauty of flannels really comes down to their versatility. You can wear them in so many different ways. And it's one of the best transitional pieces that you can own. Meaning they're perfect for this weather that sometimes is warm-ish, but also gets cold at night. You can button them up or down. You can roll up to sleeves. It really gives you a lot of variety in how you can wear them. They're also perfect layering pieces, as you can see, because of this beautiful texture that you get with flannels. Throw one over a white tee under a jacket. Not only does it keep you warm, but also adds that depth, that texture to your outfit. If I was just wearing the tee underneath now, it just wouldn't look as good. The flannel adds that depth. And the ATOS flannel is coming in this beautiful navy blue or in this incredible earth tone beige. We made sure there were easy colors to integrate into your current wardrobe so you can mix and match them pretty easily. And they're made from brushed cotton. I know you can't feel anything from the other side of the screen, but these are crazy soft to the touch. So embrace the coziness of flannels this season. Whether you get the ATOS flannel or you want something different, they bring that warmth, style, and versatility to your wardrobe. Something I'll be wearing a lot this season, knitwear, sweaters, and cardigans specifically. I love layering cardigans over tank tops or white tees. I wore that a lot this spring season. It's just an easy way to stay warm and stylish without going overboard. I have cardigans in brown, I have black, navy, light gray, and they all are really easy to style. I like them slightly relaxed, but not baggy, just not too snug around my arms. As for sweaters, I'm gonna be wearing a lot of different styles of sweaters this fall, and I think every man should own a few of these. I like the oversized sweaters for a street style look. I like this one from Ami Paris, for example. But I also like the slim fit, classy sweater, like this one from Suitsupply or this one from Reese. With the slim fit sweaters, you can actually wear a polo underneath. You can dress them up with loafers. They're versatile, they elevate your style with a more grown up, stylish look, let's say. Let's talk about pants. I'll be wearing a lot of cargoes, corduroy pants, and of course, sweatpants whenever appropriate. Now, I wouldn't wear sweatpants for a night out, for example, but I do like wearing them at home or for a quick walk to grab coffee or to run errands when it's cold outside. And as you know, cargoes are super hot, very popular right now. If you don't own a pair of cargoes, I highly recommend you get them. I have these from Banana Republic that I love. We also just launched the ATOS Movement Cargoes a few weeks back, which was the first drop for our fall collection. And I really like these from Zara that I got a couple of years ago I still wear to this day. And corduroy pants add this beautiful texture to your outfit. They keep you warm because they tend to be thicker and you can dress them up with a classy outfit for a night out, for a date, an upscale party, or an event. I like them to have a straight fit so nothing too loose and definitely not too tight. And personally, I like them to just barely touch the top of my shoes. And let's not forget the right fragrance, right? Summer fragrances, I love them. They're great, but they're light. They're usually tropical with like oceanic notes. And fall fragrances, they have spice to your nose. They're a little bit heavier. My personal favorite fall fragrances at the moment are Spicebomb Extreme by Victor and Rolf, Tom Ford, Ombre Leather, Givenchy, Gentleman. These are all incredible fragrances that will get you compliments, turn heads, and of course, give you the confidence that you need to smell amazing every time you leave your place. And I have a full video on fragrances here that you should definitely check out if you're trying to find the right one. Also, go check out the new ATOS fall collection that just launched today. I can't wait to see you wearing those new pieces and looking extra stylish. I'll see you again soon."

        "transcript": " Have you ever heard of the 1% rule? It's the principle that altering just a fraction of your habits, 1% can lead to monumental shifts of your overall quality of life. These small adjustments can create a ripple effect of positive change. If you're intrigued, or if you like the idea of achieving more, being more and living more, then just apply these small tweaks that we're about to go over. And number one is don't hit that snooze button. Look, we've all been there, feeling the temptation to hit the snooze button for just a few more minutes of precious sleep. But what if those extra moments of shut eye are actually doing more harm than good? When you go back to sleep after hitting this news button, you're gonna enter a new sleep cycle that you don't have the time to complete. So it actually disrupts your sleep cycle. And waking up during the middle of a sleep cycle can leave you feeling even groggy and more tired than if you had just gotten up when the alarm went off in the first place. And constantly hitting this news button might make you associate your alarm with annoyance, with stress, and that's not how you want to start your day. Here's what I recommend. Set your alarm for when you're actually supposed to wake up. Don't be that guy with six alarms leading up to the time that you need to be up by. Once your alarm goes off, it's time to get up. You can also leave your phone far away from the bed, so you still hear the alarm, but you have to get up to stop it. Then whatever you do, don't go back into bed. This is how your day starts, so don't let it be your first failure. Next, you need to be curious and you need to ask questions. Being curious and asking questions are fundamental aspects of human nature and critical for personal growth, learning, problem solving, innovation. Curiosity drives us to seek out new information and experiences, asking questions are going to help us understand the world around us, learn from others and expand our knowledge base. And from personal experience, curiosity actually leads to unexpected opportunities. By asking questions and exploring different paths, we can actually stumble upon new business opportunities, hobbies and new friendships. Besides that, it shows interest in others and pushes for deeper connections, which means you're going to make more friends and probably better friends who you connect with on a much deeper level. on, remember to stay curious and be consistent with your workouts for two months. Look, it takes a while for you to develop a new habit, 66 days according to research. So your goal should be to be consistent for those two months and if you can do that, it will become a part of your life, a part of your routine. I can sit here and talk all day about the benefits of exercising but I won't. I'm gonna give you the quick overview. It releases endorphins which are feel-good hormones. Consistent workouts can also help reduce stress, anxiety, symptoms of depression and of course leading to an overall improvement in mood and mental well-being. And that's just the mental part. Physically you're gonna look better, feel better, lean out, gain muscle mass, have more energy and the list goes on and on. That's why I take it so seriously. I work out five to six times a week and I absolutely love the way it makes me feel. And one thing that helps me stay consistent and track all of my workouts is my whoop fitness track. And if you're serious about your workouts, if you want the best results, I can't recommend this device enough, I absolutely love it. I've been wearing it every single day without fails since September of 2020. That's three years now. It's a part of my body. Whoop is today's video sponsor and that means you can actually click the link in the description and get the device itself for free with that link below. Now, it tells me how many calories I'm burning every day, the exact time that I fell asleep and woke up, how many times I woke up at night, which if you think about it is great to know because if you're feeling tired every day and then you realize that you've been getting horrible sleep every night by looking at your sleep data, then you know how to stop being tired. Just put your phone on silent, close the blinds all the way, wear a sleeping mask. And the best part about Woop is that I don't have to do anything. It picks up everything by itself. I'll go play soccer and it will literally know by my heart rate and other patterns which sport I'm playing. It's crazy. I even have my own personal team, the Alex Costa team, with almost 1,000 of you guys there. We have a friendly competition who's working out the most, who's getting more sleep, better sleep. It's just fun to see what you guys are up to. And like I said, if you use the link below, get your root for free as well as the first month free which is a great deal and on top of that they actually just reduced their prices which I've never seen anyone do if you look at Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus they're all going up. Woop actually went down in price which I really appreciate as a customer and as a fan. Just use the team code below to join my team we'll compare stats it's the first link in the description below. Don't be afraid to try new things. Being afraid to try new things can hold you back from personal growth, from learning, And from experiencing all good things that life has to offer. Trying new things challenges you to step outside of your comfort zone. New experiences also usually involve acquiring new skills and knowledge. Trying something new lets you expand your skill set and become more adaptable, more well rounded. And remember that it's okay to feel a little stressed out, apprehensive maybe when trying something new. But don't let it stop you from taking that leap. Approach new experiences with an open mind, willingness to learn, and the understanding that growth often happens outside of your comfort zone. Because if you're comfortable, you're not really growing. You're not trying something different. You also have to declutter your environment because a cluttered environment can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed, right? You can stress out, you can lead to anxiety. I know myself, if my stuff is messy, if my place is messy, it's just I'm distracted, right? So when it's decluttered, when it's organized, it minimizes distractions and allows you to focus on what you need to get done. Now, I don't do mel in messy spaces. I get distracted, so I keep my place organized at all times. I'm also one of those people that if I know someone is coming over, my place will be spotless. I take pride in my apartment, my space being clean and organized. And I honestly believe that a tidy and aesthetically pleasing space can actually have a really nice positive impact on your mood and your overall well-being. This next one is really important and it actually took me a while to learn this. Be intentional with your time. What does that mean? Well, it means making conscious and purposeful choices about how you spend each moment of your day. So if you're working out, for example, don't be on your phone the entire time. Be intentional. You're in the gym for a reason and it's not to text. It's workout. Focus on your workout. Get it done and leave. Your workout will be better, you'll be done quicker and you're gonna see faster and better results. It's a huge difference. And the same goes for when you're talking to someone. Give them your full attention. When you're intentional about spending time with friends and loved ones, your interactions become more meaningful. When you're intentional, you're more likely to plan your activities, to write to-do lists, and to manage your time better. This leads to more efficiency because you're working with purpose and direction, so you're likely to achieve more in less time, like the gym example that I gave you. So next time you're having a chat with someone, but really not paying attention or working out, but really on your phone, remember to be intentional. Cut your TV time. I like watching shows and movies as a creative. I even love seeing the new tech being used, new angles, new shots, and of course, the story. but I barely watch TV because I know that I could be learning a new skill. I could be seeing my friends or I could be pushing my businesses forward. And I just like those things way better than I like watching TV. So it makes it tough to justify spending time on Netflix because I know that less time spending watching TV means more time available for productive activities like learning new skills, pursuing hobbies, exercising or working on personal or professional projects. Now lately my hobby has been the guitar. I'm really trying to get good. So if you have any suggestions, let me know.

        "transcript": " Believe it or not, this is me 13 years ago. I went to the gym every day, I thought I was eating healthy, and I thought at the time that I had maximized my looks. As a matter of fact, I thought I was only going to look worse, look older. You see, when you're in your 20s, you often get scared of hitting the big, dirty 30, but for me, it was the opposite. The closer I got to 30, the better I felt. And looking at these photos, I can confidently say that I look better now at 35 than 13 years ago at 22. And let's not just limit this to my own personal transformation. Just look at some of these guys who are clearly in their 40s, 50s, and 60s, and have effectively aged like fine wine. Today, I want to give you all the secrets that I've learned, the routines that I established that will help you age flawlessly, and possibly even improve your looks and how you feel as you get older. And the first thing you need to do is take a good look at your skincare routine. And I know that most guys don't even have one. Most guys wash their faces with a bar of soap, if that. They might not even wash their faces at all. And most guys also have never applied a single drop of moisturizer on their faces, and it's pretty noticeable. Great skin needs to have elasticity, meaning it needs to be able to stretch, to move around, and to look hydrated, not dry and flaky. And a good consistent skincare routine will help you look younger for much longer. And if you don't do any type of skincare, it's very likely that by age 22, your skin will start to age horribly. Sun damage, wrinkles, acne, dark circles, those can all be improved just by sticking to a consistent skincare routine. Skincare can help you slow down the aging process by addressing those issues like fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots. And an important realization that I had is that prevention is way more effective than trying to reverse the signs of aging later in life. So establishing that regular skincare routine can help maintain that healthy, youthful looking skin and contribute to overall well-being. Now, if you want a simple skincare routine, just wash and moisturize your face in the morning and at night before going to bed. and exfoliate with a scrub twice a week to get the texture of your skin looking great and young. I would also highly recommend applying a sunscreen every single day, especially if you're going outdoors. Now, there are a lot of brands to choose from, but as most of you know, I love my Africa skincare products. Next is exercising. When I was 22, I was chugging weight gainers, eating pasta every day to gain mass, but it was really a dirty bulk. I felt heavy, I didn't stretch ever, and I had really bad posture. And I realized that lifting heavy every day without stretching, without warming up, or doing any cardio ever, it's actually really bad for your body. I was bigger, around 15 pounds heavier than I am now, but I was tight, I was getting hurt easily. And now, I realize that I wasn't healthy just because I was going to the gym every day. You need to work out, yes, but you should stretch often. You should do cardio sessions to increase your heart rate, lower your body fat, and to have better stamina. And you should eat healthy foods, not just junk to gain mass. This is another thing that, like skincare, is way better if you start early. If you're overweight at 35, it's a lot harder to lose those extra pounds than being overweight at 25. As you age, your body tends to take longer to recover and to change. That's why I take it so seriously. I work out five to six times a week and I make sure to add cardio and high intensity workouts to my routine. And one thing that helps me stay consistent and track all of my workouts is my whoop fitness track. If you're serious about your workouts, if you're serious about getting the best results and aging like fine wine, then I can't recommend this device enough. I've been wearing this for three years straight without taking it off. It's a part of my body. I wear it on my wrist. Sometimes when you don't see it, I'm wearing it on my biceps. And you see it in some of my Get Ready With Me videos. People are always asking me, what's that band? It's my Whoop Fitness Tracker. Tells me how many calories I'm burning every day when I fell asleep, when I woke up, how many times I woke up at night. It tracks all of my workouts. I put into my strength trainer all the workouts that I'm doing, every single movement, how many pounds I'm lifting, how many reps I did. And it gives me a workout score at the end of my workouts. And of course, if you wanna customize your whoop, you can also do that. They have different types of bands with different colors, different bicep bands. They even have boxers that you can actually insert your whoop into so you don't have to wear your whoop on your arm at all. You can just wear it on your boxers. It's truly the best fitness wearable tech right now. And I love mine. And by the way, if you use the link below, you actually get a free whoop device and the free first month for free. And they also just reduce their prices, which is amazing. I've never seen a company reduce their subscription prices before. It's usually always going up, like any of these subscriptions, Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, which by the way, if you're paying for those, but you think that WOOP isn't worth it, maybe it's time to reassess your priorities. So click that first link below, get your WOOP device for free, and then join my team, the Alex Costa team, I'm gonna leave a team invite code in the description below so you can join my team in making a compare stats, have a little friendly competition, and you can see how I'm doing every single day. You can call me out if I'm not working out, call me out. There's a chat, there's a team chat, Feel free to hit me up and let me know your Alex. Your strain isn't high enough. You need to work out. It's the first link below. Now the first thing that will absolutely change the way that you look when you're older is your hair. Chances of developing baldness increase with age. About 25% of men experience hair loss before the age of 21. And by age 50, half experience hair loss. On average, 70% of men will lose hair as we get older. Those stats are pretty crazy. it's highly likely that we'll be bald, me and you. So how do we stop that from happening? Well, there are a lot of ways to slow down or even completely stop balding. You don't just have to sit there and let it happen. There are two main solutions. One is minoxidil, which is a topical solution, meaning it's a liquid or a foam that you apply onto your scalp twice a day. Minoxidil reignites some hair growth. Some men even use it on their patchy beards to help fill it in. The second is finasteride, and it's actually in a pill form. Take it once a day and it slows down thinning by a lot. It can even fully stop it from happening. I added both to my routine earlier this year after I noticed some thinning and so far the results have been great. I haven't had any side effects whatsoever but you should absolutely check in with your doctor before taking these because there are possible side effects and at the end of the day, your health is more important than your hair. I know you want your hair to look good but health comes first. I also take the Forte series, Biotin Gummies daily to make sure that my hair is growing fast, strong and healthy, plus they taste great and I look forward to having them daily. And worst case scenario, you get a hair transplant. They're extremely common nowadays and I've had a lot of friends get it done in Turkey, which is a lot cheaper and they know what they're doing over there. It's the hair transplant hub right now. Something that can aid you very quickly is your lifestyle. What do you do on a daily basis? Do you sit on your computer all day? Do you go for walks outside? Do you even go outside at all? Leading that type of slow lifestyle, being indoors, being on your computer, can definitely lead to aging faster. Being stressed even causes your skin to age quickly because your body can stop producing all the natural oils and nutrients needed to keep your skin looking young. And this is scientifically proven. High stress can even lead to hair loss. So not only are you gonna feel horrible from being stressed out, your skin will look older and your hair might fall out. I read a book called, Letting Go by David Hawkins. And it basically goes over simple and effective ways to let go of negative feelings and emotions, to become free of negativity. You can't control what happens out there, right, in the world. But you can control your emotions. You can control your response, and even how you feel about those things in here. You're in control, so remember that, and don't stress out as much, because you've been okay so far, things usually turn out okay. And of course, let's not forget your diet. You should absolutely look at food as fuel. Without the right fuel, your body's just not gonna work as well. You need to eat healthy foods with a lot of proteins, vegetables, fruits, less sugar, less soda, less candy, and you should also be careful with drinking alcohol because that can really dehydrate you and speed up aging. And it goes without saying that smoking, taking drugs and other substances will absolutely go against your goal of aging gracefully. Remember that even if you're 18 right now, you might look at a man in his 30s and be like, wow, I'm so far from that, that guy looks old. But I can guarantee that time only speeds up and that in a blink of an eye, you're gonna be celebrating your 30th birthday and you don't wanna look like you're 40 or 50. I hope you actually look a lot younger than your real actual age. And I hope that you're healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life. Check out the link in the description to get your free whoop and live a healthier life. And if you wanna know what I did to stop my hair from thinning, you should definitely watch this video right here. I go over it in detail to help you out. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again soon."

        "transcript": " When you turn 20, it's like a new chapter of your life just started. You're an adult now. You're no longer a teenager. It's an incredible time, but it can also be overwhelming with uncertainty and challenges that you've never faced before. When I was 20, I had no idea what I was doing with my life. I was just moving forward and hoping that things would work out. And I'm sure that a lot of you watching in your 20s or even in your 30s, you're going through the same. You're not sure where you're headed yet, but you're moving forward and trying to figure it out. five lessons that I truly wish that I knew when I was 20 and I wanna pass that along to you and I'm sure that if you apply these five lessons to your life, you will not only be more successful, you also be happier. First one being focus on and develop better communication skills. This is life changing. When I moved from Brazil to the US, I spoke no English. I'll never forget my first day here. I was terrified. I had no friends. I didn't speak the language. How am I supposed to learn anything? That was the first time I realized how important communication was. People will talk to me and I had no idea what they were saying. I wasn't a dumb kid. I got straight A's in Brazil, but I felt dumb. I felt embarrassed. I decided on that first day of school that not only would I learn English, but I would get A's in English, even if it wasn't my native tongue. And my situation was more extreme, right? I had to learn a whole new language, but for a lot of you, for most of you, that's not what you need to do. All you need to do is improve your vocabulary. It's not a new language. When you're eloquent, when you're a great storyteller, people stop and listen. It's an incredibly powerful tool that you'll have for the rest of your life. And because I put a lot of effort into learning English, I'm now able to shoot these videos in English. When I have a point and I want to give my opinion on something, people listen because I spent so much time refining my communication skills that can effectively convey my point. So take time in your twenties, expand your vocabulary and learn how to talk to a room full of people. That will give you a massive advantage for the rest of your life in your professional life, in your dating life and with your friendships. Lesson number two, get to work. In your twenties, that's when you hustle. You're still yelling You have the energy get out there and start working try different jobs that you think would interest you and start making some money in my 20s I had so many jobs. It's actually crazy. It's comical. I was an EMT. I worked the best buy I was a bouncer. I did landscaping. I hosted a show about video games I worked at Google and I owned a professional gaming team I even became a full-time fashion influencer as you can see and that's not even all of it Even when I was working at 9 to 5 at Google I had a six figure salary and I'd still come home and shoot these videos because I was trying to make it I wanted to make it so bad. I love my job at Google, but I didn't want to work for someone else I wanted to work for myself Plus I knew that this was my true passion and I'm so passionate about this that I spent the last two years Working on this project that I'm about to review over 45 videos and hours and hours of content created to help you do the same For yourself now when people see my apartment in New York City and the cars that I drive and the watch collection I always get immediately asked the same question. What do you do for work? And when I say social media, they look pretty confused and I get it. Most people don't know that it's a huge business. But you have to remember, I'm working on campaigns with brands like MasterCard, Omega, Old Spice, McLaren, Creed, Delta. These aren't small mom and pop shops. These are big campaigns for massive brand. And it's not just me. A lot of other influencers are doing the same. And I wanna teach you how I did it. That's why I created the social media success system. I wanted to show you how you can have a great Instagram profile that will get you noticed. Then show you how to create content that stands out and gets your followers as quickly as possible so that you can work with incredible brands and either have a great side hustle that brings in a few extra thousand a month or even quit your full-time job and work for yourselves like I did. The videos are gonna show you how I shoot my videos that you see on Instagram. I'll show you the strategies that I use to grow my IG, how I edit my photos, how to get more brand deals and campaigns so that you can get that extra income and so much more. I put a crazy amount of time and effort into making this entire program and I'm really proud of how it turned out because I wanna make sure that I was giving you all the tools that you need to grow your own Instagram page. Whether you're just starting out and don't have a following or maybe you already have over 100,000 followers, you're an established creator. The videos in the program were designed to help you no matter where your starting point is. But remember that I can only show you all the techniques that I use. You still have to apply them yourself. So go over the videos, learn the strategies that I used, but put in the time. How much better would your life be if you had that extra income? Hit that first link in the description below, check out the new program and I'll see you there. Lesson number three is be curious and this is a lesson that I didn't really fully learn until later in my life and I wish I paid attention to it earlier. I was always kind of curious but never realized the correlation between being curious and learning new skills and meeting new people. You see when you're curious you ask questions, You research, you learn, you seek knowledge in anything and everything. Over time, that puts you ahead of most people. So encourage yourself to ask questions about everything that piques your interest. What is this story behind it? How can it be improved? The answers will give you extra knowledge and wisdom that you can use for the rest of your life. Reading books, articles, and magazines on different topics is a really good way to learn new things, but you don't even have to do that. You can just be curious during conversations with other people. genuine interest in the lives and stories of the people that you meet because everyone has a unique journey and you can learn a lot just by listening and asking them the right questions. And when you do that, you connect with people at a much deeper level. You learn more about them and you can form meaningful connections. Lesson number four, build healthy habits. Your 20s are by far the best time to drop any bad habits that you've formed as a team. Maybe it's waking up late every day, not making your bed, not exercising. Take this time in your 20s to build and develop new healthy habits like having a consistent skincare routine, getting 8 hours of sleep, eating healthy foods. What you don't want is to go through your 20s acting like a teenager then try and fix it later on when you're 30. It's a lot easier to develop new habits earlier on in life. In your 20s, you can adapt and change a lot faster. Your brain is still developing and according to science, it's only fully developed around 25. You also tend to have more time in your 20s. You probably don't have kids, you have fewer commitments and responsibilities, which means you have more flexibility to learn and create these new habits. And let's not even talk about the actual physical benefits of being in shape and healthy in your 20s. It's so much harder to get in great shape in your 30s. Your body just doesn't recover as fast. It doesn't change as quickly as in your 20s. This is the best time to do it. Lesson number five, embrace your failures. Everyone, and I mean every single person in the world will fail at some point. Trust me, it's not the end of the world. In fact, it's just the beginning of your learning curve. Embrace your failures, whether it's a breakup, a job rejection, or a personal setback. They're just your stepping stones to success. Learn from your mistakes, adapt, and keep pushing forward. Every successful person has a failure story. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school team. Walt Disney was fired from his job at a newspaper early on in his career because they said that he lacked imagination. Steven Spielberg was rejected from film school three times. So never look at it as rejection. It's always redirection, learn from it and move on. Don't let it destroy you because your failures will make your success story that much better. And I want you to be successful, so check out the social media success system in the description below. It's theinfluencersystem.com and watch this video if you want to know seven glow-up tips that will absolutely change your life. Have an amazing day and I'll see you soon."

        "transcript": " Let's be real, most men don't know how to dress well. And women have been running laps around us for decades. They've perfected their style. They look incredible and us guys, we're getting left behind. That is why I created this channel, to level you up. And with these seven fashion hacks I'm about to reveal, you're gonna be able to fine tune your style and your looks to be more attractive than 99% of men out there who have no clue. For example, have you ever heard of shirt stays? Most men haven't, but if you wear button up shirts, this should be a staple in your closet. They're basically these elastic straps that attach to the bottom of your dress shirt and then fast into the top of your socks. It's such an amazing hack for guys who work in offices, guys who wear button-up shirts all the time because they help maintain that crisp and professional appearance by ensuring that your shirt stays tucked in at all times. And they look a little weird. I know they look like they might be uncomfortable. They're not. They're actually pretty easy to wear and you don't even feel like you're wearing them once you have them on. Shirt stays are going to prevent that extra fabric from bunching up around your waist which can create that bulky and unflattering appearance. Also, in terms of confidence, it's really going to help you because you don't have to be tucking in your shirt all the time or worried that you have that muffin top. You can just confidently know that you look good. Next is a deodorant remover sponge. I swear by these things. Honestly, I've had one forever for many years now and it works extremely well. It's basically just this little sponge right here that you can use to remove deodorant stains from your shirts. All of that residue from deodorants that goes on, especially your black shirts, this will literally get it off within three seconds. It's like magic. You don't need water. You don't need any type of substance. The only thing you need is the dry sponge and you just literally wipe your shirt and it goes away. It is incredible. It's quick, it's portable. You can bring it anywhere you want and it's affordable. Plus it's even better for the environment because you're not washing as many of your shirts. Next on the list, this is a game changer, shoe storage. You have to store your shoes properly by using shoe racks or boxes to prevent dust and damage. I like to keep them in this acrylic see-through box here and it's so easy. It has a door, you just open it, slide your shoes in. It actually looks pretty cool and it keeps dust away from your shoes. Dusty shoes don't look good. You can clearly see that they look old. And when you store your shoes properly, you can extend the life of your shoes too. So they will last longer and you're gonna spend less money in the long run because your shoes will look cleaner for longer. And if you're looking for great shoes that don't break the bank, then you need to check out Bruno Mark, today's sponsor. They're in the top 10 men's shoe sellers on Amazon. As you know, Amazon sales are heavily based on consumer reviews, which means when someone buys Bruno Marc, they really like to purchase and end up coming back for more. It's hard to believe that sneakers like this can cost less than 50 bucks. The quality of the materials used here are great. This is the Grand Zero One sneaker, for example, and it has a soft breathable mesh upper, an elastic collar that makes it very comfortable to wear, and a soft removable win-soul for cushioning. Also, I know you can't tell from that side of screen, but this is ultra light. It makes it very easy to wear daily, walk around, commute. You're not carrying heavy shoes around. This thing is crazy, crazy light. They also have these polished plain toe Oxford shoes with a special sole for comfort and nicely padded soft insoles. And believe it or not, they go for $39. And the Comfort Fashion Sneaker 2.0, which is easy to style, you can pretty much wear this with anything you already own. And I know these prices are crazy, but what if I told you they're giving you an additional 30% off, which is a huge discount if you get Bruno Mars shoes within a week of posting this video, 30% off. and 20% off after this first week. All you gotta do is use the code ALEKS20 during checkout. Look, I love my expensive or designer sneakers and I'm gonna point in my life and in my career that I can buy that stuff, but it wasn't always like that. And I know that a lot of you guys appreciate it when I give you affordable options to look stylish. Bruno Mark is a great example and I love working with them for that reason. I want every single one of you watching to have options. So check out the link in the description of this video right below, get your Bruno Mark sneakers for 30% off the already affordable prices that they offer, it's that first link below. Have you ever heard of Bacon Neck? It's when your collars start to sag like this or this. To stop that from happening to your button-up polos or shirts, it's actually very easy. The problem is when you don't button up this top button here, gravity will do its thing and your collar will start to sag over time, even if you never wear that shirt. So just button up that top button before you hang up your shirts, you don't need to touch any of these other buttons And that's gonna prevent the infamous bacon neck from happening. You also need to make sure that you master the sleeve roll because rolling your sleeves, it really changes the entire look of the outfit, right? If my sleeves were all the way down, I would look a lot more formal. It would look like maybe it was a little colder in here. It's just a different type of look. When you roll up your sleeves, you can show off your accessories like a bracelet, like a watch. You can show off some of your forearms if you've been working out and you wanna show some of that definition, some of that hard work. So my advice to you is to learn different ways to roll up your sleeves. It's a simple trick that can make your outfit more relaxed or dressy depending on the occasion. This is how I like to roll up mine. It's a very easy, very simple way to roll up your sleeves. Just unbutton your shirt, roll it up all the way to your elbow crease. And then when you're done folding it up, just tuck in the extra fabric into that fold. It looks clean, professional, and at the same time, nice and relaxed. Now, if you don't know what a fabric shaver is, and if you've never used one before, I'm about to change your life. Fall is just around the corner. We're gonna be wearing sweaters again. And you're gonna see what's called pilling, which is when you get those little annoying dots of fabric all over your shirts, all over your sweaters. A fabric shaver is literally going to shave all of those off, all of those little dots, and keep your sweaters in other shirts and fabric looking brand new. It's gonna remove that lint, remove that pilling altogether. So if you have a sweater that looks like it's old because it has all those little dots, all you gotta do is literally get a fabric shaver and it will come off so easily. It's such an amazing hack that literally renews your clothing. Next, a hack that I've been using for literally years because I hate ironing or steaming. Not gonna lie, it's just a lot of work and sometimes I'm in a rush, I'm leaving my place. So what I do is I use a water bottle like this one to spray my clothes with water. There's no other solution in here besides water and that softens up the wrinkles. All you gotta do is spray your clothes from about 10 to 15 inches away. If you get too close, your clothes are going to get wet and then you're gonna have to throw them in the dryer and it defeats the purpose. So make sure that you're far enough away so that your clothes are just getting a slight mist on them. And before you spray, just make sure you pull the fabric and stretch it out and then spray, that would be a lot more effective than if you just spray it without stretching out the fabric first. Make sure to hit that first link below to get your Bruno Mark shoes for 30% off this week. And if you want seven glow up tips that will completely change your life, you need to watch this video right here because I go into detail in how you can look your absolute best. Thank you so much for watching. Make sure to subscribe if you're new and I'll see you again soon."

        "transcript": " As a man in his mid 30s and owner of a men's hair product brand, naturally one of my biggest fears is losing my hair. And it's not like it haunts me, it's not like it scares me every day, but once in a while I run my fingers through my hair. And if I see too many hairs breaking off, I do get concerned, right? What happens when a hair influencer's loses his hair? I mean, I guess I could do videos on how to shave your head with no cuts or best sunscreen for your scalp. But as you can see, I still have a lot of hair in my head. However, about a year ago, I did notice that my hair was staining. It just didn't have the same density it once had. I could see a lot more of my scalp than before and that really scared me. So I freaked out and I ordered everything that works, the finasteride, my noxidil, and once it got delivered, I chickened out. I didn't start those treatments because I was scared of the possible side effects, which by the way, you know, for finasteride or erectile dysfunction, low libido, and a few other symptoms. So I didn't take it last year. I decided to wait a little bit longer and confirm that I was staining before taking those daily pills. Fast forward to about six months ago and yeah, my worst fears were confirmed. When I shot a hair video and I noticed this clip, it didn't even look like me. I immediately renewed my finasteride subscription, started taking it a few days later. And by the way, if you're not familiar with it, finasteride is a prescription medication that helps prevent further hair loss by blocking the conversion of testosterone into DHT, which is a major cause for hair loss. And my Noxidil, on the other hand, is a topical solution that can stimulate hair growth. So I started on both. And side note here, definitely do your research, check out the possible side effects before you start taking those. I thankfully have not noticed any side effect whatsoever from any of those two products. But I didn't stop there. I wanted to make sure that I didn't lose my hair. And here's the thing, I know that worst case scenario, I fly to Turkey, I get a hair transplant. It's not really that bad. Elon did it, James Franco did it, Lewis Hamilton did it, LeBron James, and a bunch of personal close friends of mine have gone through a hair transplant, and the results are pretty amazing. But obviously, that's last resort. I still had some tricks up my sleeve and my hair wasn't gone yet, so it was just starting to thin. I had some time to figure it out. And let me also say that six months ago, I was going through some personal things that brought a lot of stress and anxiety to my life, something that I never really feel, I'm not an anxious person whatsoever, so that was new to me. And I do think that a big reason for this moment right here that you're seeing on screen was that stress. Now, when you experience significant stress, your body can enter a state of shock. And in response to that stress, a large number of your hair follicles can actually start to shed, resulting in thinning of the hair. But it's important to know that hair loss due to stress is actually temporary and usually reversible. So as your body recovers from that stressful event and your stress levels decrease, your hair growth cycle should return to normal and your hair should start regrowing. But I wasn't 100% sure if it was stress or if I was naturally thinning as most men do in their 30s. That's why I decided to do something about it. And I researched a ton before I did anything, but through that research, I found out that it's possible to stop or even slightly reverse hair thinning. I read that scalp massages could really help hair growth, for example, and I went on a rabbit hole to find the best scalp massagers. How does it help? Well, it's about stimulating blood circulation to those hair follicles, giving them a better chance to grow faster and stronger. I found this device from La Duora, and it's a really cool looking portable scalp massager that stimulates hair growth. I started using like three to four times a week and LaDouara sponsored today's video, which I thought was the perfect opportunity to talk to you about this hair journey that I've been on this year. The LaDouara dual scalp and hair care device isn't just a normal scalp massager. This thing is next level. If Apple or Tesla made a scalp massager, this is what it would be. Not only do these massages help manage stress and reduce tension, but again, it's also proven that they improve blood circulation to the hair follicles that helps with the hair growth. But the device also shoots a low level microcurrent to the scalp, which can help stimulate hair growth by promoting even more blood flow and increasing cellular activity in the scalp. And you probably noticed that it has this really cool red light here, but as much as it looks cool, it's not just for aesthetic. Many studies actually show that red light therapy can improve hair thickness and density as well as stimulate hair growth. And last but not least, it lets you add a pod here in the middle of the device. And you can choose what kind of serum you want, depending on the results that you're looking for. they have the boost, balance and awaken and you can alternate between them or just choose your favorites. And those ingredients in the pod get slowly transferred to your scalp as you massage it. So as I'm massaging my scalp, I'm getting the vibrations, the low level microcurrent, the red light therapy and the serum all at the same time. I told you, I'm not playing any games. I want my hair to be thick, healthy and around for a while. So I'm consistent with my scalp massages and I can say that from personal experience, it's made a difference for me. So if you're worried about thinning, If you just want a nice relaxing scalp massager, this is what you're looking for. And I'm gonna leave a link to the La Duora dual scalp and hair care device in the description below so you can go and check it out for yourself. All right, so now I'm taking finasteri daily. I just take a pill before going to bed. I apply my Noxidil once a day to my crown and I massage my scalp three to four times a week. But hold on, there's more. I told you, I did so much research. I wanted to do everything in my power to keep my hair in my head for as long as possible. And the results are visible. So just stay with me because these next few changes to my habits also made a big difference. And most guys don't even think about them until it's too late, which is sad. When you start losing hair, we call it thinning. And believe it or not, that's exactly what happens to the hair follicle. It starts to shrink and shrink in size gradually until it gets so thin that it just breaks off easily, it falls off and that's it. It never comes back no matter what you do. Once it's gone, it's gone. So knowing that, I decided to be way more careful, more delicate with my hair, especially in the danger zones. And the danger zones are your hairline all the way to your crown back here. So all through the top here. Those are the danger zones. The sides and the lower back, that's not going anywhere. I have an insane amount of thick hair right here and that's gonna stay. As a matter of fact, this is where they pull the hair follicles from when they do a hair transplant. They literally pull from the sides and the back and just replant them into your scalp where those other hair follicles once lived. I'm way more careful when I wash my hair in the shower. Instead of being aggressive, I take my time, I use less pressure with my fingers to wash my hair. I'm more careful when I'm brushing my hair, not to cause any breakage. When I'm blow drying, I try not to get too close to my hair so it doesn't dry it out and damage it. And I always, always apply a heat protectant before using any heat tools like a blow dryer. And when I towel dry, I always pat dry instead of aggressively towel drying. And let me say, even if you're not thinning, it's still a good idea to be careful to not cause that breakage. Broken hair doesn't look or feel as good. So if there's an easy way to prevent it, why not, right?

Now I wasn't very consistent with my hair vitamins before, but now I don't miss a single day. And most of that is due to the fact that I've been testing out the new Forte gummies, which most of you know we launched a couple of weeks ago. It's just more enjoyable to chew two tasty gummies a day than to swallow big pills. And the supplements that you're looking for to make sure that you have healthy, strong hair will be biotin, zinc, iron, and vitamins B, C, D, and E. I just sleep better at night knowing that I'm giving my hair the best possible chance of growing faster, thicker, and stronger. And speaking of sleeping, I changed all of my pillowcases from cotton to silk. And there are three amazing benefits of silk pillowcases. One, it's a lot softer than cotton. So when you're moving at night, your hair doesn't get pulled or tugged and you lose way less hair and it causes way less breakage as you sleep. Two, it's better for your skin because it's so soft. And three, it feels way more luxurious than any other pillowcase. And once you try them, you're never going back. I've always shared so much of my life here with you.

        "transcript": " We've all seen them. The guys whose fashion choices do not match their age at all. Whether it's a teenager trying to dress like he's a successful businessman, or a grown man trying to dress like he's a young high-beast. There are no rules in fashion, but there are guidelines that you should try to follow if you want to be taken seriously. Today's video is about that. This is how to dress for your own age. Let's start with 16 to 20. This age can be one of the most fun times of your life between graduating high school, going to college, and possibly moving out of your parents' house, right? you're probably just starting to get a taste of independence. This means that you can wear whatever you want, embrace that versatility and experimentation because this is the perfect time to explore, both in terms of personal style and life experiences. Take advantage of this period to experiment with different looks and different trends. The more you experiment and try new styles, the better your fashion sense will be in your 20s, so starting early is the way to go. Try the TikTok trends, go for a bold look and change up your style often. This is the time to do it. Find inspo on Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, explore different colors and see what works best on you. No matter what you do, don't be one of those guys that buy the same t-shirt in five different colors. This is the perfect time to learn and expand your style, not to settle for the first thing that fits you well. Same goes for your hairstyle. Enjoy that thick, full head of hair now and let it grow longer. Go for a youthful haircut like a messy middle part, curly fringe, try braids or a design because you might not get the chance to do it later in life. One really important thing to note is how much your physical shape affects the way that you're looking close. Being fit and in good shape will drastically increase your chance of looking your best in any specific style that you're going for. And trust me when I say that it's a lot easier to get in shape at this age than later on in life when you're working multiple jobs and your body doesn't respond or recover as quickly. So make it a goal to be healthy and fit at this age group so you set yourself up for success later on. From 21 to 29, you explore with casual and more formal style choices. You invest in versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down. You focus on fit and quality rather than quantity. This is when you really dial in your style and figure out who you are as a man. Where you work and who you work with will also have a big impact on your style. If you work in an office that requires formal attire, let's say, then you will most likely start dressing that way even outside of work. This is normal and you can see it in the tech industry, you can see it in sports and in real estate, for example. Just remember that where you spend your time from nine to five doesn't define who you are. Feel free to explore, try new styles at this age, because you're still young and you have plenty of room for growth as a man personally, professionally, and of course, style-wise. If you're in this age group, I recommend you explore the old money style, which is especially trendy now in 2023, but most importantly, this is always gonna be on trend. That's because it's the type of style that doesn't tap into fads like extra baggy pants or ripped jeans or crop tops. Old money is all about timeless, classic pieces, like linen shorts, dressy trousers, light washed denim, white leather sneakers, fitted sweaters, cardigans, and of course polos. Polos are a staple at this age because you can wear them to a business casual office setting, you can wear them out for drinks with friends, and you can even wear them under a suit jacket. The one I'm wearing today is from Collars & Co. who sponsored today's video, and here's why they're better than other polos out there. First and foremost, as the name says, their colors are special. They're designed to maintain their shape. One of the worst things that can happen is you spend your money on a polo, you wear it once, you wash it. And then it comes out of the laundry with the color looking all deformed, floppy and sloppy. These are firm, they're sturdy. So when you wash them, they maintain the shape. But also when you're wearing them, they sit up all day. They're not gonna spread out flat on your body, which makes them look old and worn out. All of that while still being machine washed, so you don't have to dry clean them. In this age group, 21 to 29 is great because you can wear baggy jeans with graphic tees one day and then a nice polo and dressy trousers the next. So it's really good to be able to explore all of those different styles. and polos are going to be versatile. If you have a date at a nice restaurant or a business meeting with your boss or maybe a possible new business partner, you could wear them by themselves for a business casual look. You can throw a blazer on to dress them up. You can even wear a sweater over them showing some of that collar off for that old money preppy aesthetic. The thing is, a lot of men in their 20s forget to try out polos and they're missing out on a whole world of timeless style. Polos will never go out of style. They've been around forever and they'll continue to be popular and on trend for years to come. So you can invest into nice polos instead of buying a fad like oversized graphic tees, for example, which may or may not be on trend next year. If you're looking for a performance dress shirt or a polo that looks great all day, or if you want a classic button-up shirt that is soft, stretchy, and comfortable with the same collar technology that keeps them looking crisp and maintain that shape, check out Collars & Co. I'm gonna leave a link to the website in the description of this video. From ages 30 to 40 and beyond, you wanna start dressing up a little bit more elevated. Not only because you probably have the financial means now to invest into high quality clothing, but also because it's time to be more sophisticated. At this age, you should own a nice suit that you can wear to weddings, since most likely you're gonna be attending more of those. You should get formal leather shoes, a decent watch that you can wear every day, a fragrance that's more mature and elevated, and of course, go for a hairstyle that isn't trendy on TikTok. Like a more professional haircut that you can style neatly when you're walking into a meeting, let's say a classic quiff, a side part, or a bus cut. It's also good to remember that in your 30s, you can still have fun, all right? This is coming from a man in his mid 30s now and that feels weird to say, but hey, I still wear fun outfits once in a while at music festivals, going out with friends or on vacation. At this age, it's not like you have to suit up or wear boring outfits all the time. Feel free to have fun and keep those graphic tees for when the time is right. By this point, your career will also have a huge impact on the way that you dress. I'm a fashion content creator, so my style sense might push the boundaries a little more compared to a man who works in real estate and wears suits daily. Or a professional personal trainer who wears athleisure and gym wear most of the time because that's just a big part of his life. My advice to you here is don't forget to step outside of your comfort zone still at this age. Wearing your real estate suits when you're running errands or meeting with friends, it's a little too much. Or your personal trainer athleisure wear when you're going out on a date at a high-end restaurant, that's not gonna do the job. Your style should be more versatile than that, no matter your age and no matter your career. One of the things that I see happening with guys 35 and up is that they stop evolving stylized. They get stuck in old trends, buying the same clothes over and over again. It's never too late to redefine and refine your style as long as you do it at the right place and at the right time. As a matter of fact, this is arguably the best time to fine tune your style because you're probably at this age group, have more money in the bank, you can buy nicer shoes, a nice watch, you can find a better hair stylist, you're probably going to nicer places than when you were in your 20s, which requires you to dress a certain way. And even influences you to wear nicer clothes because you see other guys doing the same. However, at this age, it is best to stay away from crazy bold outfits that will make you look childish and immature. But that doesn't mean you can't wear colors or fun patterns. And by the way, if you're looking to build your wardrobe, definitely check out this video here on the only five pants that you will ever need to be stylish. Make sure to check out colors and code to get your great polos, shirts, and more. And of course, subscribe if you enjoyed today's video. See you again soon."

        "transcript": " Finally made it to Florence. So after a long journey that included a flight from DC to Rome, a shuttle from the Rome airport to the Rome Intermediate train station, a train ride from Rome to Florence, and finally a quick cab ride, I have arrived at the incredible Bottega Veneta Suite at the St. Regis Florence, Arno is literally right outside my window, which will be my home base for the 108th edition of Pitti Uomo. What is Pitti Uomo? Why am I here? And most importantly, what am I going to be wearing? Give me a second to get unpacked and I will answer all of those questions for you. Alright, so I am actually trying out a brand new method for packing my suit jackets. I had my usual way, which is where you turn the shoulder inside out, but this is something new and it is supposed to keep the wrinkles completely out of the suit jacket. So I think I have maybe five or six jackets here and the way you do it is you put them on a hanger and each jacket you cover with some plastic from a dry cleaner. Jacket one's looking pretty good and I am told that the interesting thing is the more jackets that you put on the hanger the better it is because it keeps the hard fold out of the jacket. So there are five jackets and I have to say they all look pretty darn good. Sorry long journey definitely needed a shower before changing in all these clothes. Is it weird that I'm in a robe? Baby? Whatever. Actually, let me change because I'm pretty sure the last thing you wanna see is me in a row for the rest of this video. All right, so what is Pity Roll Mode? Now, if you're just a casual menswear enthusiast who's never been to Florence for pity, it can seem via all the photos that you see online. That's just a bunch of dudes in suits, standing around talking, smoking cigars, drinking the gronies, and just basically trying to get attention and get their photo taken. Well, you're not wrong. There definitely is some of that. I call it the influencer petting zoo, trademark. But it's not all that happens, and it is definitely not what Pity is all about. Pity Omo is the world's most important menswear trade show. Happens twice a year in Florence, when we can January, when we can June at the historic Fortessa de Basso, where brands from all over the world come to showcase their collections to both buyers and press. It's where trends are set, it's where deals are made, and it's where the menswear industry comes together to do business. But it's much more than that. Now, because the Negroni has become sort of the unofficial cocktail of menswear, I'm gonna go with this as a metaphor, so stick with me. The Negroni is an equal parts cocktail. Gin, compari, sweet, remove. It's the perfect combination of herbaceous, bitter, and sweet. And I've always considered pity on what it would be like a Negroni, an equal parts cocktail of trade show, party, slash events, and networking. Which brings me to why I'm here. So why am I here? Well, I can tell you that I'm not here to just stand around in the influencer petting zoo. No. I come to Piti with four very specific objectives and purposes. The first is networking. The menswear industry is very close knit as I mentioned, whether that's on the retail side of it or the social media side of it. So connections are very important. You never know where a specific conversation is going to lead. It could go nowhere. It could turn into something huge, but you've got to be out there meeting people to make that happen. The second reason I'm here for the sixth time is brand awareness. You know, I'm not just an online personality. We also have the Eastpoke Style Shop, which basically gives you direct access to my entire tailored wardrobe through a really game-changing process where we're able to offer you the best value in custom menswear online. Now how does one capture brand awareness? Well it's a combination of the first thing, networking, and the third reason I'm here at which is hosting events. For the past three editions, he spoke style along with our partners from Michael Andrews for Spoke and Angel Ramos New York have been co-hosting some pretty cool events and this time we are doing three. The first is on Monday night it is a creative black tie appartivo that we do right here St. Regis Winter Garden. This is our third time doing it and as the trade show starts on Tuesday, our event on Monday has kind of become known as the unofficial opening ceremony of Pity Wilma. And then immediately following that event, we're going to transition over to the, I'm not even going to try to pronounce that, it's the Florence Rowing Society where we will host an exclusive 25-person seated dinner on the banks of the Arno with the Ponte Vecchio as the backdrop, completely next level. And then the third event is a panel discussion also right here at St. Regis featuring myself, Mike Angel and Caroline Andrews. And that whole thing is going to be moderated by our friend Matt Hranick who I'm sure many of you are familiar with as WM Brown project on Instagram. And finally, in addition to networking, brand awareness and event hosting, the fourth reason I'm here is to create content. A lot of that is for he spoke style, well for you guys, but we'll also be creating content for our friends and Michael Andrews bespoke. And this time our partner right here at sandwiches. I know it all sounds extremely fun and glamorous and it is, but it is also a ton of work. World's smallest violin, right? So that's why I'm here, but I know that you are here watching this video to see everything I wore at Pity Ormore. And you may wonder, how do I decide what to wear? Well, there actually is a method and I'm going to quickly walk you through the process of how I planned my outfit. So it's not just me here, we're here with a team of guys from our partner brands, six total and someone thought it would be a really fun idea to plan out themes so we could have some general consistency and cohesion when we're taking our photos together as a group. I know what you're thinking that sounds silly I thought so too but it's kind of nice to have that framework and then see everyone's personal take on each theme it actually works out pretty well. So the themes for this pity Momo are as follows. Black tie creative tonal Tuesday, technicolor, pity PI yes as in in Magnum PI, but do you think I'll wear those Celtic short shorts? Classic black tie, bringing preppy back in black and white. Those are the themes, here are the outfits. Now you could say that my interpretation of black tie creative isn't overly creative and you wouldn't necessarily be wrong, but you really need to know yourself and this is about as creative as I'm personally comfortable. My go-to move for the stress code is always some type of standout dinner jacket, the one I'm wearing in light blue has a great texture, breathable fabric, brand new in the shop, perfect for the summer. I've paired it with our pleated front tuxedo shirt, always my choice to spice up a formal look and some midnight blue tuxedo trousers. For the accessories, I've got some white Albert Thurston suspenders, Kodas Maya stud set, vintage cufflinks and midnight bow tie on the wrist, my JLC Reverso, and finished off with some patent leather belgium. Back in January of this year, I coined the term Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday, Tonal Tuesday. one of my getting dress videos, kinda caught on. I did more of them, people liked it. And now it's a theme for this edition of Pity. Now, if you're thinking, hey, you already did this outfit in your last long form video, I would say yes, kind of. But I did make a few updates to keep it just a bit fresher. This is our ivory twill suit, honestly, one of my favorite suits of the season, paired with our sand colored chambray shirt. And notice how the texture of the shirt creates some contrast with the suit. Sunglasses are the Jacques-Marie Maj Fitzgerald's, unfortunately sold out, but check eBay, if you're so inclined. On the wrist, long a one. brown suede belt to pair with the brown suede loafers by Bowden and Lane. Okay, Technicolor. To be honest, I was thinking about sitting out this particular theme. Lots of color isn't necessarily my thing, but I think I found a way to do it and still stay within my comfort zone. And here's what I'm talking about. I thought it was the perfect opportunity to style another brand new piece in the Eastbrook style shop, our Merlot Bamboo Sportco. I am not twinking any fucking Merlot. Bamboo, AKA California cashmere, is a wonderful fabric for the summertime. It's light, breathable, soft like cashmere, and very, very sexy. Literally, people will not stop touching. I paired it with our light pink poplin shirt because real men wear pink and some ivory twill trousers, which are from The Last Look. Sunglasses are the Jacques Marie Mange Fitzgerald on the wrist, JLC Reverso, Brown Suede Velt and Bowden and Lang Suede Lovers. All right, as I am about to reveal my pity PI look, let's revisit the question I asked as I was listing out all the outfit themes a little earlier in the video. But do you think I'll wear those Celtic short shorts? Now, when it comes to the style of Magnum PI, you basically have two classic archetypes. Aloha shirt with nut hugger jeans or some sort of casual top with scandulously short shorts. Throwin' a Detroit Tigers baseball cap, a Rolex GMT Master Pepsi, some light-colored boat shoes, a sweet stash in, you've pretty much nailed it. So now that I've laid out those options, let me ask you, what do you think I did? Well, here's what I did. Come on, man, it's pity, not Halloween. So I'm gonna take that tasty Tom Selleck inspiration and interpret it through my personal style. Up top, the standout piece is this Todd Snyder silk cotton camp collar shirt, which I've tucked into pay homage to Mr. Thomas Sullivan Magnum IV. I've paired that with a Todd Snyder ribbed t-shirt underneath and our white cotton trousers, not of the nut hugger variety. A tonal hat with my favorite team. Thank you, suck daddy. Thank you, suck honey. Jacques-Marie Mache fits Gerald sunglasses. On the wrist, my Omega Speedmaster, and some mirthless shoes to round the lookout. Look number five is our classic black tie outfit. Wearing a tuxedo in the summer is not a problem if you have the right tuxedo like this one. This is our wool mohair blend tuxedo, which we like to call the dewy tropical tuxedo, which I've paired with our self-textured tuxedo shirt to keep it ultra classic. You know what I find funny about black tie is that it looks simple, but there are so many little details that go into this look. You've got your suspenders, your stud set, your cufflinks, your bow tie, your cummerbund, silk socks. For something so simple, there's certainly a lot of elements to it. And then on my wrist, my JLC Reverso. Glasses are by E.B. Marovitz. And patent Belgians to finish it off. Look number six, I'm bringing Pripy back. Yeah, definitely a reason I was a saxophone player and not a singer. Anyway. Up top, I'm wearing our beautiful alabaster Glen plaid sport coat cut from Del Fino cloth. I created this as a replacement for this jacket, which everyone love, obviously, because it is now sold out. So don't sleep on this one. By the way, if you haven't signed up for my newsletter already, you probably should do that. Not only will you get all of our best content delivered right to your inbox, but you will also receive an exclusive discount code to save on your first order in the He Spoke Style Shop. Link to that is in the description. The rest of the look is chock full of classic preppy elements. We've got our light blue OCBD paired with some khaki cotton trousers, Clubmaster style sunglasses. These are the Oliver Peoples Banks. Here's that baseball cap again. Crocodon Jones penny loafers with some cream colored socks. Okay, black suit in the summer might not seem like a very low informed choice, but like the truly tropical tuxedo, this is also made with a tropical wool to keep it light, breathable, and very comfortable. Underneath, I've got another silk cotton shirt from Todd Snyder. I love wearing these more fun types of patterns during the summertime, and I've left the collar out over the lapel for some classic 70s swag. By the way, if you're going to try to pull this look off, always make sure your collar is over the lapel in the back as well. Sunglasses are the Katz 5000 from Rayban, On The Wrist by Rolex Datejust, and a pair of Auschwitz Belgians to anchor the look. All of these outfits and many, many, many others are available to check out in the Style Guide on the He Spoke Style website. The Style Guide is a tool we've created to help you get inspired anytime you are struggling moving outfits together. You can search by season, occasion, specific clothing items, type of footwear. Links to every outfit in this video are down in the description. I'm ready for pity and what I need to tell you is, thanks for watching. Stay Taylor."

        "transcript": " I love these shoes. They're beautiful, gorgeous, amazing. But I'm gonna tell you something now and don't even pretend like you've never been in the same situation. You're browsing online, you see something, you fall in love with it, you buy it, it arrives and then you're like I have no idea how to wear this. This is a problem that could literally apply to anything style related, but for me, the biggest issue is always with footwear. Which is the exact situation I found myself in when these beauties arrived. These are the Mirkvis Stenhammer II penny loafers in black. Black loafers I said, they can't be that hard to style. Well, they didn't click for me right away, but I'm happy to report that they finally did and I've got five different outfits for you today featuring these bad boys. Hey, you want an old fashioned long form outfit video? I listen to you. This video is sponsored by Mierk Fist, more on them in a bit, but let's get right into what you're here for. Alright starting off our first outfit with an elevated casual look, simple and fresh color palette, that's super versatile and perfect for spring and summer. I am wearing our lightweight cotton chore coat in Navy, brand new in the shop, absolutely love this piece and I paired it with a simple Heather Gray t-shirt from J. Crew. For the pants I'm wearing our white cotton trousers and even though they have belt loops I've gone with out of bell to keep it cleaner and more casual. Sung glasses are the Moscott Lemp Tosh with the American Gray fade on my wrist, the Cartier Tank American and then finishing it off of course with the Mirafis penny loafers. Now I want you to listen to me very carefully because this is important. If at this point in the video you are considering leaving a comment about the fact that I am going with the sockless look. Please seriously reconsider because, number one, I am wearing socks. They're just no shows. Number two, these are spring and summer looks. So it's wrong with getting a little extra breeze down there. And number three, nobody gives up. For look number two, another elevated casual look that I'm gonna call old money modern. It's got those old money vibes, but the high contrast gives it a more modern feel. I'm wearing our black cotton PK button up shirt, which I've paired with a classy cashmere cream cable knit for seas, sweater from Ralph Lauren. Now, sweater over the shoulders like this is definitely a vibe, never thought I could pull it off, but tried it a few times, built up some confidence, and that's what it's all about. For the pants, I'm wearing our stone cotton trousers, black leather belt this time. Sunglasses are the Jacques Marie Maj Malino's. On the wrist, I have my JLC Reverso, and on the feet, the Mirkvis loafers. Outfit number three, putting a little prep in my step, Kinda sorta maybe definitely inspired by my friend, Jamie Ferguson. Amazing photographer and a super great human being. I'm wearing our ivory cotton canvas chore coat like the Navy from Look One, also brand new in the shop. And I've paired that with an off white T-shirt from J. Crew. For the pants, pera classic Levi's 501s in a light wash. A navy baseball cap for another preppy touch. Moscott Limp Tosh, American Grey Fade sunglasses again. On the wrist, Cartier Tank American. And loafers with jeans, such a classic preppy move. Now have you noticed what I've been doing with each of the first three looks? There's little trick or method that I've been using to give the outfits a sense of balance. Some people call this the sandwich method. And what this is, is a styling technique where your top and shoes are the same or a similar color, the bread. And then in between, you have a contrasting color, the filling. This was the key for me in terms of how to style these black penny loafers. So next time you're stuck styling anything, give it a try, see what happens. All right, so the shoes I've been wearing this entire video are from Myerkfist. Myerkfist is not only a cool Swedish name, They're also a cool Swedish company that happens to make some really great footwear at a fantastic price point. I'm friends with these guys, they're standup dudes, and I have to say that they are obsessed with their dedication to craftsmanship. Let's get nerdy about this shoe for a second, this is 10-homer too. So this is an apron-fronted penny loafer built on a rounded and wider last, their last number 21, to be exact, and finished with a thin half rubber sole. Designed to stock home and handcrafted in Portugal, like all Mirafis footwear offerings, It has leatherboard heel caps and cork filling and is made with a Goodyear-welted construction. In addition to the box calf, which I have here, it comes in dark brown and black suede, dark brown calf and a black country calf. To learn more and explore the full collection, head on over to their beautifully designed website. I'll drop a link in the description. And we're back with look number four, which is maybe more along the lines of what you're used to seeing me in, a suit. It's tonal, light colors, definitely conceived with summer in mind. And notice how the sandwich method is being employed here. Not thick slices of bread, more like sandwiched thins. I'm wearing our ivory twill suit, paired with a sand colored shirt underneath. Now, when you're working with similar colors, make sure you've got something like the texture you can see on the shirt here to create some contrast. I did go with the belt this time, just because it kind of felt right. For the sunglasses, we have the Jacques Marie Maj Malino's on the wrist, my JLC Reverso. And for the shoes, I think you know what these are by now. Look number five is definitely the most conservative of the bunch, just a classic business casual-esque ensemble. And look, wearing socks. Up top, I've got on our Hopsack Sportcoat in light gray, paired with a crisp white button-up. And if you're wondering how my collar stands up so well, well, this is how. I just put this under my collar and it's like magic. Don't knock it till you try it. For the pants, just a classic charcoal trouser in a perennial fabric. Sunglasses are the Jacques Riemage Molino. On the wrist, my Rolex Datejust. And one last time, the Mirkbiss Penny Lovers. The takeaway here for you is that even I, the all-powerful YouTube style god, even I have trouble styling certain things. But what you have to do is keep trying, experimenting, and practicing. I spent an entire morning trying to put together these five looks. It wasn't magic. So what I'm telling you is put in the work, and you'll see results."

        "transcript": " Good morning. Good morning. It is 5.42. And we're headed to the train station going to New York today for a very specific purpose. I'm going to be designing some of the spring and summer pieces for the Eastpoke Style shop. Just in case you think I haven't been listening, I have been listening to you and I know that a lot of you have wanted to see a more long-form video. This is a little bit different format than I think you're used to, but I heard you. So we're doing a long-form video. Taking you along to New York City with me today. Let's go. I can't. I'm terrible at pulling into parking spots, so I always back in, which Robin hates, but you never know when you need to make a quick getaway. That's my dad joke. Okay, so we are in the quiet car, which is like a light-brown-like environment, so I I can't talk that loud. If I'm on the train, I do like to get worked up. There's my reading glasses because that's where I'm at in life right now. Man, this is the bag that I keep all my cards and stuff in. A reader. But I'm probably not going to be reading. Maybe I'm going to be on the bail. Computer. This is new for me. It's the ASUS Zenmuk A14. This is so light. So I do always like to work with them on the train. It's always important to be productive. At least that's how I roll. This computer is great. One of the things I really don't like, I'm just lying, but especially when I just bring my briefcase with me. Instead it's just so easy, and this is so amazing. I can't even tell you. It's very portable, baseless though. Kill ground. So it's ultra light. It's very durable. That's important too. That brings up a lot. It's resistant to scratches. My arm is just finger prints and all that stuff. Basically battery life which is lost up to 32 hours. That was the look. It's very pretty new. I just missed that. So as I mentioned the reason I'm going up to New York is to decide some stuff for the Spring Summer collection. So I have made some notes already but I'm going to take this time to kind of review everything. I'm going to prepare it so I know what to look for. I'm going to put on fabric bucks. Now I'm going to catch up with some emails so I don't just think about it during the day. Maybe I can get some ideas. Usually they're pretty cool. Usually very creative in the morning, so get those down. But, again, most important things. I'm going to prepare it and go into the studio. So, I'll be starting today. Alright, here we are, arriving at the Michael Andrews Bespoke Studio. And don't look. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a simple, simple, and easy to make. I'm going to show you how to make a If I want the Laura Piano, give me the Laura Piano. You want it, you got it. All right, so I'm here with my friend Corey Sylvester, COO of Michael Andrews Bespoke and my go-to guy for all things, he spoke style-related. Today, as you know, we're here in New York City to pick out some fabrics and basically design some new things for the spring and summer collection. We did a lot of the hard work and this is going to seem like it's super easy and magical. It just happens like that, but finding fabrics and picking them out takes some time. So we were doing a little bit of that beforehand so we can just get right to the meat of what we're here to do. And the first thing that we've been talking about for a long time is sort of filling in some gaps with perennials that we're missing in the shop. That's right. you had a few, well actually we had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight perennials that were among the best sellers. Yeah, for how many things, great things we already have on the He Spoke site, I kind of took a look back historically at what over the last 10 years or so have really resonated with the Michael Andrews client and we wanted to make sure that we were offering those through He Spoke as well. Yeah. Good. a couple of our books that are, I don't know the other one went, well there's two that we like for that, this one and the Sienna Italian exclusives one. Yeah so a lot of these will be fabrics from mills like Vitaly Barberas-Cononico, Reda, Dino Falarte, really good perennial what I always say like middle of the fairway all season clothing. Straight down the fairway, yeah that is definitely our guy. So the first one there were eight suits that we're trying to fill in. We do a classic navy blue pinstripe, a gray bird's eye, charcoal shark skin, a blue bird's eye, a navy plaid, what navy, well how would you call this? Yeah like a navy glen check. Subtle glen check. I've wanted to do one of those for a long time. Kind of like a macro glen check because it's quite a large, it has a good scale but a real kind of subtle prominence. Exactly. The bird's eye is gonna be especially nice to have because that's something that people see on the swatch and always look at by, but then you see it made up and it's really remarkable. Right, so the classic blue pinstripe, I wear a lot of chalk stripes. Sure. But I don't have a pinstripe, so yeah, we do. Yeah, so the chalk stripe comes from the milled finish of like a flannel fabric. It's the only way you get that kind of like fuzziness that we think to be like chalky. So here it's going to be a lot more clear cut because it's just a nice, fine, worsted wool. Mm-hmm. The classic navy blue pinstripe. The gray bird's eye. The charcoal shark skin. The blue bird's eye. Yeah, that's going to be what I really like because it's sort of a combination between the like darker navy blue and the lighter royal blue. Right in the middle, you know, it gives you some variation between navy and gray and also with texture. just a solid suit, that subtle texture. Yeah, it looks, it's got that detail. When you come up close, you can see it, but from far away, it looks like a solid. Exactly right. And then we had our navy plaid. We're also gonna do a charcoal herringbone to sort of compliment the navy herringbone that we've already got on the site. And then this one I'm kind of excited about. We're calling it the light gray James Bond suit. I didn't even know if we were gonna talk about this one if it was going to be a secret agent, so to speak. Yeah. So yeah, actually, we knew that there was a Bond suit, but we weren't exactly sure which Bond film it was in. It just so happens that there's this handy-dandy feature on the Asus Zen book A14, the Co-Pilot Plus, where you can hit that button and the AI comes up and we could say, what movie did James Bond Bond, Wear, The Gray, Plaid, Suit. Sean Connery. Sean Connery. And then the third one, which was a bit of a wild card, I would say, was the Dark Green suit. You said that is one for a very specific guy. Yeah, we've been seeing more and more requests for green. It's been pervasive in the collections more and more each year. year, what I like about a dark green, like a forest green is it almost appears like a gray, like a charcoal when you walk in the room and then when you get on top of it, you know, you see that it's more sophisticated color choice. It's an earth tone so it goes well likely with a lot of the stuff that you would already wear like a navy or gray suit with so it's kind of easy to wear and pair a good alternative for somebody who doesn't want just another bluer gray. Yeah, I agree. Alright, so those are the perennials that we're filling in our gaps. Then one of the things I really wanted to do, now we're getting into more specific things for spring and summer. I've been doing a lot of traveling. You had this jacket you wore at pity. It was like a chore coat. And we definitely need to do those. So we had two, we're going to do two versions of that. The first one we're going to do in a mullskin, a navy mullskin. Oh, that'll be killer. And we're going to have, it's going to have four pockets. Yep. Two breasts, two down at the sides. Yeah, the, for the choreco model, the right breast pocket is actually on the interior. So you have kind of like a stash pocket for things like this. So that's going to be cool. And then we also had a canvas, like an ivory canvas. Yeah, it's a Japanese canvas made from cotton and linen actually, and an ecru. I don't know where that went. I guess I forgot to bring the thing up. Must be downstairs. Yeah. Suits, we're already doing a lot of suits, and we'll talk about the details of how it will style them, not necessarily here, but I always like to do something new. I'm trying to do a little bit less, as I mentioned at the beginning of the year, so this year I really wanted to do, I do all this with pity in mind. Also, things that make me happy. But like a cream, so we have the cream linen suit, but there was a, I'd really love to do like a cream kind of yellowish, more of a yellow in the cream double breasted suit. I love it. And the fabric we chose for that one was from where? From this one. Actually right from the book that's downstairs I think. Oh, there it is. There it is. So for suits, cream linen, no, this isn't linen. So for suits, cream wool. Yep. And then I also wanted to do a brown linen DB because I love my brown linen suit, but let's just say I got it a long time ago and it doesn't fit quite the same as it used to. So for the brown linen, we're gonna do this. Fits have changed, bodies have changed. Yeah, exactly. That's why we need a good tailor. So the sport coats, there are a couple that we have that, where the fabric is out of stock. And I think that's something people don't realize is that fabrics go out of stock. We're not able to get them. Despite our best efforts. Despite the best efforts, right. So we're unable to find a replacement for this cream houndstooth, wool silk and linen blend that we have, unfortunately. And then we did have a very beautiful Loro Piana kind of glen plaid, beautiful fabric. We did find a little bit of a replacement for that. It's gonna be new, a new version for Spring. It's the Havana collection by E. Thomas. I think that would be really nice. That's great. And the one note I would make on that is when you see something, don't sit on it because they do go out of stock, especially when there's something more unique or special. That's something I think people don't realize or just think like, oh, it's always available. Unfortunately not. So yeah, if there's something that's really unique, that's when you have to kind of jump on it. That's right. Or it's going to be gone. I always like to do new formal wear too, especially if we've been hosting our pre-pity party. So this year, I usually am pretty classic. I'll do black. In the winter, I'll do burgundy. But for this year, I thought I'd maybe do something a little bit lighter. And make sense for the summer? Yeah, where was that book that had that? No, it's not this one. Glats and Summer Breeze? Yes, it was a Summer Breeze collection in this beautiful linen. Yeah. Oh, it's a wool silk linen blend. It's even better for that purpose. Yeah, I'm gonna do this as a dinner jacket with a peak lapel. However, I'm gonna do flat pockets so I can tuck them in. I love that. I have jetted pockets. But the question is, if you're gonna do that, If you're going to do a dinner jacket that you can tuck in with flat pockets, do you do one button or two buttons? Oh good question. For me, I would rather have a one button jacket. I think it just looks super rake-ish and sartorial as a spork coat than a two button dinner jacket. Yeah, there was another version of this I saw that had a three roll tube. I don't think that was the way to go. Not for a dinner jacket. No, definitely not. So we have this. Unless you're from Naples. Beautiful summer breeze fabric. And then that's pretty much it. So we're keeping it kind of tight this year. Really going hard into the perennials and things we need. We know that people really love. Yeah. Some key seasonal pieces, but also like really building out where we thought there might have been some gaps in the kind of perennial investment kind of grade pieces. Yeah. And you can see. talking to you guys for a while now, but literally like probably two, two and a half hours of searching through fabric books, trying to find everything. So all this stuff is great. We're going to get it into production and it'll be up on the site soon. And that's two, two and a half hours after doing this for like 12 years together. Yeah. And there are certain things I don't even ask about anymore because he knows me so well, like linings, whatever make a decision for me, buttons make a decision for me. He knows what I like. what's having a good tailor is all about. That's my pleasure. Well thanks for sitting down here and we'll wrap this up and I'll get everything to you and we'll get it ready to go and up on the site. Great. Alright man, thanks. Thanks."

        "transcript": " Let me lay this out for you as simply as possible. It's summer, you're going to be traveling, you want to pack light, you want to stay cool, of course, and you want to look your best. Never fear, a new capsule wardrobe is here. 10 pieces, 19 different outfits, this is how you do it. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style, and this is a channel for you, if you are someone who's been trying to figure out how you can improve your style. It's practical advice, straight to the point, lots of inspiration. And what's really interesting is that if you follow and apply what I'm talking about, not only will you look better, but you'll feel better too. And if you want to go even deeper, I encourage you to sign up for our newsletter, link right up there and in the description, click enter your email, get signed up, and not only will you get even more helpful content, but I'm also giving you a special 15% discount on your first order in the He Spoke Style Shop. Let's start with a simple definition. So what is a capsule wardrobe? A capsule wardrobe is a small edited collection of clothing items that all work together. So you can mix and match everything in the collection to create many different outfits with just a few pieces. Capsule wardrobes are great because they save you time, energy and money. They reduce the number of decisions you have to make since you're really creating some guardrails in terms of the pieces you're working with. And a capsule wardrobe is great for the environment because you are doing more with less. You can design a capsule wardrobe around any situation, occasion, season, or dress code. I've done several already on the channel from a beginner's capsule wardrobe to business casual to seasonal. And you can make your way through them all by clicking on that playlist I've put together right up there. But today we are talking about a summer travel capsule wardrobe, 10 items total. So let's get right into it. Now before I get to the 10 items that I'm including in this capsule wardrobe, let me talk about some things that I'm not including, but are things that you should definitely still pack. So I'm adding this disclaimer because every single time I post any kind of travel wardrobe video or a what to pack video, someone will inevitably make a snarky comment like, what about underwear? What about socks? What about toiletries? Well, obviously you're going to pack those things. What we're talking about a capsule wardrobe here, and when I talk about a capsule wardrobe, I want to focus on the essentials. Not that underwear isn't an essential, but those essential pieces that will help you build your outfits. So just for the sake of argument here, in addition to saying that this is a summer travel capsule wardrobe, let's also say that it's for vacation and you may be going to a resort. So here are some other things that I would be sure to pack. No Show socks and pro tip here, the best No Show socks for men are actually women's Peds. Don't argue with me and don't knock it till you try it. Gentlemen, are you tired of your No Show socks actually showing? Women's Peds. Call 1-800-GIRL-SOCKS today for your free consultation. That's 1-800-GIRL-S-O-X. Thank me later. A hat, fragrance, sunscreen. This stuff is the best. Dopp kit, swim trunks, camera, all this tech stuff, watch, collapsible catch-all. You get the idea and I think I've proved my point here. I'm still packing all these things, even though I'm not including them in the capsule wardrobe proper. Speaking of the capsule wardrobe proper, let's get to those 10 items. Up first is a slate blue Glen plaid Sportco. It's 100% linen and half lined, super light and breathable. The pattern is subtle but sporty and patch pockets keep it casual. Item number two is a cream and brown Houndstooth Sportcoat. Beautiful wool silk and linen fabric, very versatile. This has been my favorite travel jacket this season. Item number three is a stone linen safari jacket. More casual alternative to sport coat. Love the pockets, especially for travel. Great way to cover up from the sun or keep a little warmer on a breezy seaside evening. Item number four is just a simple white cotton button up. Goes with everything, easy to dress up, easy to dress down. Item number five is a printed short sleeve shirt. I always love a bold printed shirt in the summer and a vacation is the perfect opportunity to trot it out. Item number six, just a classic black t-shirt. Obviously very casual, but can easily be worn with a sport coat for a perfect dressy casual vacation combination. Item number seven, cream linen trousers. These are a go-to for me during the summer. Light, breathable, versatile, perfect for the season. Next item number eight, we've got a pair of black linen trousers. Huge contrast from the cream linen. And I like these especially for dressing up in the evening. Item number nine sunglasses. These are the American Optical Original Pilots classic military heritage. Got the bayonet temple arm. And I'm including this in the capsule wardrobe and deliberately limiting myself because I generally tend to bring way more sunglasses than I need whenever I travel. And finally, item number 10, a pair of Grant Stone bourbon suede penny loafers. One pair of shoes for an entire capsule wardrobe, you ask? Yes, one pair of shoes to rule them all. That's right, this shoe is incredibly versatile, as you'll see, and it's the shoe that I've been traveling with more than any other for that very reason. I do want to dive a little bit deeper into this shoe and Grant Stone as a brand, as they are today's featured sponsor for this video. Now, if you are a He Spoke Style website reader already, by the way, if you're not, you definitely need to become one, you may have seen a very in-depth review that we did of the Grant Stone Brass Boot and Diesel Boot in Color 8 Chromax Cell. This review was completely organic, not sponsored in any way. I just heard a lot about the brand and wanted to get hands-on with one of their best-selling products, specifically because the quality of Grant Stone is often compared to the quality of Alden. And if you'd like to read that review, I've linked to it right up there. Now the Alden comparison didn't just come out of thin air. The founder of Grant Stone, Wyatt Gilmore, his grandfather worked at Alden for a mind-blowing 60 years, and his father also spent a career there as a salesman in the Midwest. So shoemaking was really in Wyatt's blood and doing his own thing, making his own way was very important to him. So Grant Stone came about after Wyatt spent six years in a factory on Xiamen Island learning the whole shoe making process and he became particularly interested in Goodyear welding which is a construction process that allows you to continually re-sole your shoes and he also was interested in many variations and patterns, last and also developing prototypes for many global footwear brands. Now, Grantstone footwear is produced in China and the whole China thing is something that Wyatt does not shy away from talking about. It's something that I do think is important to talk about. It has some meaning for me as well because the clothing we sell in the He Spoke Style shop is also manufactured in China. There are always going to be some people who say, oh, if it's made in China, it's crap. The truth of the matter is that it's not about where it's made, it's about how it's made. When you have direct access and control of the factory that you're using and great materials, like in the case of Grant Stone and He Spoke Style, you are able to ensure that what you're selling to the public is not only high quality, but that it meets every single standard of excellence that you set. So let's take a closer look at the shoe, the Traveler Penny and Bourbon Suede. The idea behind this loafer was to find a balance between comfort and versatility. Obviously, it's a very classic penny loafer design, so just by nature of that, it's going to be very versatile on casual. And you can also see that we have a bit of a shorter vamp here. That gives it a little bit more of a casual look as well and makes it easier to slip on and off, thus making it a great travel shoe. Let's talk comfort. So as with all Grandstone Welted Shoes, the Traveler Penny has a leather insole with a softer tannage specifically for flexibility. And they use an oil-dipped butyl leather outsole, which is more flexible than a traditional leather sole bend and also has water-resisting properties. Both of those things promote a much quicker break-in period and I can attest to that because these shoes felt great right out of the box. The beautiful bourbon suede is a fine calf suede which is sourced from CF Stead tannery in England. The suede as you'd expect is incredibly soft as I wear these more and more they're honestly starting to feel slipper-like that's a good thing. The suede has aged very well I expect I'll continue to do into the future and this is a material that's meant to be worn in all four seasons. Great looking shoe definitely recommend checking it out it's priced incredibly reasonably I'd say at $348 available in three different widths DE and triple E and while you're on the Grandstone website if you subscribe to their newsletter you can save $20 on your first footwear purchase. So we've got the shoes, got the wardrobe now let's put it all together and check out our 19 outfits. I know 19 is a weird number and I really did try to squeeze 20 looks out of this but there is a reason I just couldn't get to 20 which I'll explain so be sure to follow along. Look number one combining the white shirt with the cream trousers and the houndstooth sport coat. It's tonal, minimal, a little bit of visual interest via the houndstooth pattern. Look number two just going to switch up the jacket to the slate blue glen plaid sport coat which now becomes the focal point still with a with a nice subtle pattern for a cementress. Super classic, absolute no-brainer. Look number three, again swapping the jacket out this time for the Safari jacket. Another tonal look that's still somewhat dressy, but a bit more of a casual and sporty vacation style because of the Safari jacket. Look number four, I'm going without a jacket, just the printed shirt with the cotton trousers, much more casual and relaxed with a slightly oversized fit, being great for keeping cool. Look number five, similar but different. Just by simply tucking in the shirt, I can completely change the overall vibe of this look. Little dressier, great for an early evening cocktail. Look number six, just gonna throw on the safari jacket. I love how the style of the jacket really plays into both the color and pattern of the shirt. Very summer, very fun. Next, look number seven, a little more respectable with the Houndshoe Sportcoat. To be honest, I wasn't sure that the patterns going to work together, but because they're different scales, jacket small, shirt large, they combine really well together. Look number eight. Once again, changing the jacket, leaving the foundation the same. Much different look, same concept, subtle pattern, old pattern. Look number nine, simple t-shirt with sport coat look. Love the contrast between the shirt and the pants. Little bit of pattern in the sport coat for some visual interest and the color of the jacket ties in nicely with the loafers. Look number 10, casual and relaxed, still looking put together. Again, the Safari jacket lending a sporty but elevated feel to the entire look. Look number 11, you guessed it, just changing out the jacket to the slate blue, glen plaid. Cooler colors up top, warmer tones on the bottom, yet everything works together. Look number 12, we're moving into black linen trouser territory, pairing it with the white shirt and hands to sport coat, which helps to tie in with the color of the bourbon suede loafers. Look number 13, swapping the Houndstooth jacket for the slate blue glen plaid. I might typically wear a pair of black loafers with this, but the bourbon suede gives us a really nice burst of contrast here. Look number 14, same foundation, white shirt, black trousers, but throwing on the safari jacket to give it a more relaxed and sporty feel. And also you can see the color of the jacket works perfectly with the loafers. Look number 15, printed shirt tucked in, casual but elevated. Again, brown up top plays nicely with the color of the shoes. Now this is where I thought I could squeeze out another look by untucking the shirt, but for me that was just a little too casual with the formality of the black trousers. Look number 16, just gonna add the Houndstooth sport coat. Really love the interplay of black, brown, and white. It's minimal, a bit unexpected, and I think it's incredibly chic. Look number 17, black t-shirt, black trousers, sand colored linen safari jacket, complimenting the bourbon color of the loafers, high contrast, casual, sporty, and I'll say it again, incredibly chic. Look number 18, same all black monochromatic foundation, but we're classing up the joint a little bit with the Houndstooth sport coat. And you can see, even though we've got an all black foundation, the color of the sport coat helps pull in the color of the shoes, tying everything together. Look number 19, same thing, different jacket with the slate blue, Glen plaid linen sport coat. The suede loafers, they can stand out piece here, providing some contrast. The thing I love most about a travel capsule wardrobe like this is that you do have so many different options. I don't know about you, but I find it really hard to plan specific outfits for a trip. And when I try to think outfit to outfit like that, well, it kind of feels like too much of a commitment. I feel locked into those particular outfits. And you know, what if I get to where I'm going and suddenly I'm not as inspired by the looks I put together before the trip. But as you can see with 10 pieces, I've got 19 different combinations. So no matter how I'm feeling or what I'm doing, there's gonna be a way for me to combine those pieces in a way that makes me feel good. It's an exercise, it takes some planning, and I do wanna thank Grant Stone once again for sponsoring this video to help me stretch myself in this way and to be able to show you that yes, 19 different outfits are possible, even with one pair of shoes. And of course, reminder that when you subscribe to the Grant Stone newsletter, you can save $20 on your first footwear purchase."

        "transcript": " Have you ever seen that men discussing meme? Well, there's one related to watches that I think is really good. That's it right there. And you know, it's funny because it's true. Now listen, I'm passionate about watches, as you know, but I really hate the snobbery, elitism, pretentiousness, arrogance, condescension, self-importance, sense of superiority, spugness, and contempt for those less knowledgeable or not in the club that devotees of the watch world can sometimes engender. That gets a big, fat, eye roll emoji from me. Fatter. That's good. Watches should be fun. They should reflect your personality. They should be something that you love. That's why you should buy a watch, not because you want to fit in with all the cool rich kids. I mean, what is this, middle school? So in this video, we are going to be taking a look at a new release, just debuted at Watches and Wonders from a brand that I personally love, that really leans hard into that sense of joy, personality, and individuality that watch collecting should be all about. We'll take a close look at the watches and I'll show you how I style them right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style and you know what happens when you dress well and start to care about your appearance? You feel good about yourself, you feel more confident. It's life-changing. And this channel is all about helping you look and feel your best so you can make changes to live the life that you want. All right, watches. So as much as I tried to conceal which watches and which brand I was going to be talking about in the video, obviously the B-roll gave it away. So you know that we are going to be talking about Nomos glasshuta and the new Tangente 38 date 175 years of watchmaking glasshuta in 31 colors which they just debuted at watches and wonders in Geneva. This video is sponsored by Nomos. They've been a partner of the channel for a while and I'm always happy to work with them because I think they make phenomenal watches that are an incredible value. So there are a lot of reasons to love the new Tangente 38 date. It's an iconic no most design. 38 millimeters is pretty much a perfect case size, in my opinion. You've got the in-house manual winding DUW4101 movement in the price, $2,310. Very accessible. What makes this version of the Tangente 38 special and unique and fun is that it is available in 31 different color combinations, as I mentioned, meant to appeal to all different kinds of personalities. You know even the experience of browsing all the options online on the website is fun. I mean check that out. I can play with that all day. And you can too by going to the description where I've got a link to the site. Let's talk specs. Like I said 38 millimeter stainless steel case. Actually it is 37.5 millimeters if we're being precise. This is a German brand after all. It's 6.8 millimeter stick with a lug to lug measurement of 47.7 millimeters. All that is to say that this watch looks and feels great on the wrist. On the dial we've got that classic slender tangente typography. The hands are rhodium plated, sub-second style right above six o'clock, and the large date window right at six o'clock. Now there is no crown position to advance the date, but if you go past 12 to change the date, then all you have to do is go backwards until the hour hand hits nine and then go back to 12. That's a little hack to change the date a little quicker. The case back is sapphire crystal glass revealing that beautiful in-house movement. At the bottom you can see the name of the watch and that it is a limited edition of 175. Each of the 31 versions of this watch is limited to 175 pieces. The number is an homage to the rich watchmaking history in Glasshuta which was founded over 175 years ago. We've got a light gray woven strap keeping it sporty and if you want to know the lug width is 19 millimeters. As mentioned, And there are 31 versions or color combinations, something for every kind of style and personality. For me, because I consider my style to be classic with a modern sensibility, I've chosen these three versions to style in this video. The high fish grouw, the Schneesturm, please don't hold back making fun of my German, and the pop orange. I know I got one of those right unless it's pronounced popo range. Actually, to see how I did, here's my German friend Wiemann. Heifischgrau, Schneesturm, Poppo-Röntgen. Uh, well, so, 0 for 3. Anyway. Yes, Wiemann? Hey Brian, one more thing. Poppo in German is a nice word for butter. Thank you. Your welcome. So, those are the three watches I've got here. Now let's take a look at how I would style them. Starting off with a mostly monochromatic business casual look. Dark denim button down shirt, navy blue cotton trousers. Don't freak out. Not worrying about was a conscious decision. Suede, Coyote Capris in a color called Moonlight and gray dial, no most Tangente date providing some contrast. This is a good standalone kind of business casual look, but if you did want to dress it up a bit, I would reach for a light great hopsack sport coat. Really nice texture, more of a casual feel, patch pockets make it more relaxed as well. And the color ties into both the sneakers and the watch quite nicely. Up next we've got something similar but a little more relaxed. Up top is a gray cotton jersey button-up shirt paired with the same navy blue cotton trousers from look number one. Same suede sneakers as well and for this look I'm going with the white and blue dial tan gente 38 date. You know having spent some time with these watches now I really think that it is a great watch for someone who has a sportier Business casual style or a style that leans a bit more towards the casual side in general And be sure to stay tuned until outfit five to see what that looks like on me. Alright now before we get to outfit number three I do want to put out a warning or trigger alert if you are offended by outfits that show ankle in other words the sockless look and I use scare quotes because I'm wearing no show socks please Pretty please go to the bottom of this video frame Hover over the timeline and skip to the chapter labeled outfit five if you leave any comment about this outfit or outfit number four Related to socks or lack of socks you will get a big fat eye roll emoji So now that that's out there in the open On with the show. Okay, so this is pretty much what I would call my summer uniform simple chic and elevated. Up top the shirt is by Todd Snyder, part of the New Spring Summer collection, slight and breathable, and I really like the looser fit. I've combined that with a pair. I meant to say I paired that with a pair of black linen trousers, really my favorite pair of warm weather trousers over the past couple of years. JMM sunglasses, Ostrich Belgians, and the orange dial Tangente 38 date to complete the look. I've been loving the simplicity of black and white clothing for a while now. It's a simple foundation that you really can do a lot with and it makes it really easy to throw in a fun unique burst of color like we've got with the watch. Well here's a spring and summer suit if I've ever seen one. This is a terracotta hopsack. Check out that fabric. I mean look how cool that is. The texture, the white flex. I'm gonna call this the suit of the summer. Lots of ways to style it obviously here keeping it casual with a cream t-shirt, suede sneakers, sunglasses, and gray dial tangente. You know, at first I didn't think I'd be able to style these watches with a suit without changing the strap, but I wanted to challenge myself, and I think the more casually cool outfit styling here, the color of the suit paired with this particular watch works. You can let me know if you disagree. Maybe a little bit of a shock for you, but this is what I wear on the weekends. I bought this North Face fleece for a ski trip back in March, but I love it so much. I find myself wearing it on most chilly mornings when I head out to the gym before the sun comes up. And I wear sweatpants too. But for this look, I've got it paired with a cream t-shirt. It's by Buck Mason, nicest t-shirt I've ever worn. Light blue jeans are a classic Levi's 501s. I did mention I've been enjoying a little bit of a looser fit. Navy baseball cap, cream socks, suede sneakers, really getting a workout in this video, and the blue and white dial Tangente 38 date. Simple, casual, weekend, great watch, don't really need to do more than that. So that felt good. Outfit video, watches, isn't that what you guys love the most? Big fat thank you to NoMos for sponsoring this video and continuing to be such a great partner for us here at the channel. The new Tangente 38 date, 31 color combinations, amazing price, great watch, you need to check it out. and you can do that with the link in the description. So thank you for watching, good to be back, and stay tailored."

        "transcript": " Hello, it's good to see you again, and I know that it's been a while and I know that many of you are wondering Whether or not I was ever gonna make a long video again, but there's been a lot going on and what I want to do today is to Really get you up to speed on exactly what's been going on and why that has taken me away from YouTube For much longer than I wanted lots of changes lots of improvements lots of new developments. We've really taken a humongous leap forward in what we've been doing as a whole and a big part of that has been the redesign and development of the new He Spoke Style website and the HSS shop. So in this video this is what you can expect. I'm gonna talk about how we got to this point, why I think now is the time that we needed to do this. I'll tell you how we found the right people to make this happen and then walk you through all of the incredibly exciting features of the new site including the amazing editorial experience, the brand new style guide, the new and improved HSS shop, spoiler alert, we've been able to bring our prices way down. The Grim Guide, our incredible team, and why I think this matters. I will tell you that as you've probably seen, we are refocusing a lot of our effort into the channel and making videos again. It's going to be a mix of short and long form content. And before we get to all this stuff, I can't wait to tell you about, I do want to encourage you to sign up for the He Spoke Style newsletter if you haven't already. There is a link in the description that says join the community. So click that. It's going to take you to the site. Just enter your email, get signed up, and not only will you get all this great content that we've been producing on the website, but we're also giving you a 15% discount on your first order in the HSS shop. Alright, introduction over, and I want to start by talking about how we got to this point. So I'm going to start at the beginning and don't Don't worry, I know that if you followed a long time, that you know the story already. Not really gonna get into the details, but what you'll be most interested in is the context around how all this came to be, which I don't think I've really shared before. Though if you have watched the video, then I know freaked many of you out. That's the one right up there. It will sound somewhat familiar, so feel free to skip ahead to the next chapter if you feel like you've already heard this. I started He Spoke Style over a decade ago. It was actually 2013. And you know the story, it's been told many times, chronicle of my personal style journey that coincided with an online men's style and lifestyle vanguard. Completely uncharted territory and when I think about it today, it seems so quaint and innocent in comparison to where we are now, but back then there were a small handful of us at the tip of the spear, defining whatever this thing was. And it was a really special time. So the timing of all this activity was both fortuitous and auspicious for me personally. At that point in my army career, I was a middle manager under the thumb of an unproductive, very unproductive and less than supportive leader. Yeah, saying that. So he spoke style really gave me a much needed creative outlet that kept me happy, kept me balanced and kept me fulfilled. So, and I was also encouraged by the realization that it could be a viable business. As HSS began and has continued its upward trajectory, so too did my career in the Army. We had new leaders that came in, they really embraced my media savvy and spirit of innovation. And as a result of that, not long after, I found myself in more high-risk positions with lots more responsibility. So suddenly, as you can imagine, it became a lot more difficult for me to balance and manage all things HSS related. At that point in my Army career, I had about 15 years of active duty service. So not sticking it out another five years to get a retirement was just a complete non-starter, not gonna happen. So during that time, we did what we could, when we could, and I think we did a pretty good job, but we definitely had to pick and choose where to direct our focus and energy. Having experienced the level of success that we had early on. Rob, who you all know, he was also in the army, also now retired. Rob and I would often talk about and lament and commiserate kind of like, if we only had more time, where could we have taken this by now? I realized that as I say this, it might be coming off as like, the army sucked and it was such a drag, but that's really not the case. I absolutely love my job. Got to do some really cool stuff, but it was definitely time for a change, and here we are. But you're probably wondering, you know, why did I decide to invest in a new website, go back to blogging, which seems kind of old school at this point, but it's really something I thought a lot about, got some very strong opinions about, and I'm about to tell you why I think now is the time to do this sort of thing. In our current era of disposable short form content, going all in on a massive website redesign might seem anachronistic out of touch or just stupid. I could literally wax poetic all day about the evolution and current state of men style online, particular in the influencer world, but suffice to say, I believe we're reaching an inflection point and possibly a reckoning. Now don't get me wrong, while there's definitely certainly an upside to the ease now with which people are able to create and be seen and be heard and spread their message. The abundance of short form content for me often lacks intent, meaning or a point of view. I really feel like there are more look at me people than listen to me people than ever before. And it's honestly something I'm getting really tired of. So I feel, and you know, it's not just me because I've talked to a lot of people who are kind of feeling the same way. I feel that the pendulum is really swinging And I believe now is the time to lean into substance and thoughtful, well-crafted content. That's exactly what I wanna do. It's not gonna change anything. I just feel like somebody needs to take a stand here. But we're gonna continue to adhere to all those same core values that have underpinned our brand from the beginning. Quality, approachability, timelessness. I missed my finger. And integrity. Now, designing and developing a website is not easy, especially one like ours, which has been around for so long and has a ton of content and some proprietary things like the style guide, for example. Planning for this project began well over a year and a half ago, you know, for something of this scope and complexity, it was really important that we work with the right partner because it's one thing for something to look nice, but it's another for the entire backend of it and how it functions, how fast it is, how different things can work together with ease and make it easier for us. you want that part to be just as elegant. And finding an agency that understands design, tech, and brand equally, and can also successfully put those three things together to achieve what a client's looking for and more, is pretty difficult. And I've often felt like looking for someone like that was kind of like hunting for a unicorn. But luckily, we found our unicorn in the form of Toronto-based digital agency article. And I have to give Ryan and the entire article team a big shout out here because if you go to the website, you can clearly see that their work is remarkable. We're diving into some of the biggest features and upgrades to the new site and shop in a bit, but I do have to say that their ability to problem solve, innovate and leave no detail unconsidered was and is inspiring to say the least. Just to cite one example, our new fonts. I know it doesn't sound like much, but a font is so important to how a brand feels and can say so much about you. So really, really super important. And the detailed explanation we got during our first design presentation on why these particular fonts, which are GT-Sectra and GT America, if you're curious, were chosen for us, bordered on philosophical, and they applied that level of meticulousness and thoughtfulness consistently throughout every level of the project, which really just confirmed that we definitely engage the right team for this project. So I realized that was quite a windup, but now that you've gotten the complete backstory, what I'm gonna do now is to walk you through some of the biggest and most exciting features of the new He Spoke Style website and shop. The first thing is a new and unrivaled editorial experience. You know, when we decided to commit to this project, one of our biggest desires and objectives was simply to get back to basics. We love to tell stories and wanted the ability to be able to illustrate those stories much more vividly. We can do that now. I call it an editorial experience because we really want to convey a feeling through our visual creative. We've always gone the extra mile in that sense, so we're really thrilled to have the ability to present that material with a look and feel that matches the incredible people, places, things, and experiences we'll continue to showcase. not to mention Rob's amazing photography. The next big upgrade was to the Style Guide. From when we first launched the Style Guide in mid-2015, it has been one of the site's most popular features. It was conceived to allow readers and new viewers to easily search our large and ever-expanding catalog of style editorial for outfit ideas and inspiration. But, you know, a tool like the Style Guide is only as useful as it is easy to use, and I have to admit that its original iteration was not without a handful of issues. But thankfully, the new style guide addresses and solves every one of those problems that we had, making it easier and much more enjoyable to use, discover, find inspiration, and more. To expand on exactly what I mean by that, let me share five of what I think are the most exciting changes and new features of the style guide. First is that it is more focused with fewer choices. As with many things, less is very often more. And that was one of the guiding principles of the new style guide. The original version allowed you guys to search by pretty much any imaginable piece of an outfit, which resulted in something that was way more bloated than it needed to be. And then additionally, the abundance of choices was frankly overwhelming. So by distilling the search categories down to four key areas, clothing, season, occasion, and footwear, we're allowing you to quickly access options while still providing the ability to drill down and refine your search. The next upgrade is that the style guide is now mobile optimized, which makes it more fun and easy to use. So we knew the mobile experience for the original style guide was pretty seriously lacking. It looked terrible, difficult to filter, no easy way to reset the filters, maddening to navigate back to once you'd clicked into a particular outfit since it would take you out of the style guide and into the original post, but that's all been addressed and we know you're going to love using the new version. Filtering is simple and dare I say fun. Once you've selected a single look you want to explore, you can easily jump right back into your search results and if you're so inclined you can click into any article we've written that features that particular outfit you are viewing. Pretty neat. The next upgrade is that we can now have multiple images which means more inspiration. And so while we love writing articles, we know that when you are searching for outfit inspiration, sometimes all you really need is a visual, especially if you're in a hurry. So we've made it quick and extremely easy to see more of the outfit in greater detail with just a scroll or swipe. Additionally, we've created a separate content type for the style guide, which basically allows us to post even more outfit inspiration independent of our regular editorial. And we also want the style guide to be a place to feature you guys are incredibly stylish viewers and readers, you can submit your best looks to us on Instagram with the hashtag style guide HSS or by sending an email to styleguide at hespokestyle.com. And finally, and finally, we've made the style guide shoppable. So whether that's garments from the HSS shop, more on that in just a second or otherwise, it's never been easier to shop the looks you love. So that's what's up with the style guide. Now let's take a look at the new and improved HSS shop. So when we launched the HSS shop in 2017, it was stocked with a small hand selected and curated collection of brands and products that we loved. You guys loved it too. And because of the circumstances, Army related mentioned before, we had trouble keeping the shelf stocked. Good problem to have, less than ideal for you. Building on that success in 2021, we formalized a partnership with Michael Andrews Bespoke, one of our longest running brand relationships to offer a range of private label custom menswear. That's a mouthful. Private label custom menswear designed and curated by me, basically giving you the option to shop my closet and providing you with MEB quality at a made to measure price point. The new shop is so exciting and we know you're going to enjoy it for a variety of reasons, which I am about to explain. The first reason I know you're going to going to love the new shop is that you told us what you wanted and we listened to you. So over the past two, three years, we've received lots of feedback from you guys telling us that you really wanted to purchase from us, but the price was just a little bit out of range. And as a result of your feedback, we've implemented some changes that have allowed us to dramatically lower our prices while still delivering you the highest quality garments at an incomparable value. You may be wondering, how do we do this? Well, it comes down to our previous fitting model, which required you and a partner to take close to 20 different measurements. So we learned real quick that this was not only hard for you, but it was often inaccurate, which led to increased time on our side having to adjust and dial into measurements. That was frustrating, and it created an additional cost that unfortunately had to be passed on. We've collected a lot of data over the past two years of online fittings, so much of it in fact, that we've been able to build a sizing predictor that is insanely accurate. However, despite its accuracy, which is truly insane by the way, we definitely believe you deserve much better than that. And we are fully committed to helping you achieve an exceptional personalized custom fit. And this next bit is the true differentiator for us in this space and at this price point. So once we forecasted your size, you will receive a prototype trion garment. Along with your trion garment, you will also be sent a small kit that includes a ruler, tailor's chalk, and pins. At this point, when you navigate to your personal account dashboard on the site, you will find your complete measurement record along with short videos where I'll personally guide you through the process step by step, teaching you everything you need to know to expertly assess the fit of your trion garment and make the necessary adjustments to your pattern. So if all that sounds a bit intimidating, let me tell you it's not. When you get into classic menswear, the reality is that you become a student of fit. Over the years, you build a relationship with your tailor and during that time, you develop an eye for what right looks like and the adjustments necessary to fix whatever's wrong. That's been my journey over the past decade and change and what we are providing you with is no less than an accelerator course in tailoring. It's something I honestly wish I had when I first got into this stuff. So we're confident that you will quickly become an expert, but we are still providing you the option to book a 15 minute bespoke consultation with one of our tailoring experts. If you're not feeling it and just want a little more peace of mind. In addition to reduced pricing and a new fitting model, there are several other incredible HSS shot features to check out, as well as an overall really highly improved and enjoyable experience. We honestly couldn't be happier with how it turned out and invite you to explore everything that we have to offer. Another big update to the site is that we are now offering our complete and growing Groom Guide series. So a little back story on that in 2021, just as we were coming out of the pandemic, we undertook an exceptionally ambitious project, which was to create a complete video series designed to help grooms look and feel their best on their wedding day. And we did it. Initially, we offered it as a paid course that's been utilized by both grooms and wedding professionals. That was great, but we really felt strongly that more prospective grooms should have access to that content. So we've changed our model now and we're offering all of the Groom Guide content on the HSS website. So in addition to being publicly available now for the first time, we've made the entire experience much more dynamic. Instead of just watching the videos, some of them you've seen here on the channel already, you can still do that obviously. There are also articles that are really elegantly illustrated and easy to shop. So if you are getting married soon, dive in and let us help you look and feel your best on what will definitely be one of the most important days of your life. One of the biggest challenges we've faced as we've continued to expand into different areas like video, editorial, e-commerce, has been maintaining consistency across our vast scope of activities with a small team and limited time. We really had to pick and choose, as I mentioned, where we could focus and leaving things often to wilt on the vine, despite our best intentions. We needed to grow so we could scale, but we really weren't in a situation where that was possible until now. When I decided to retire from the Army after 20 years, I was fortunate and very grateful to have been given a pretty long runway to plan, develop, and execute on what was truly necessary to make HSS what we wanted it to be. Anyone who's run their own business knows that it's nearly impossible to work on your business when you're constantly working in your business. In other words, the necessity of the day-to-day activities required to keep things status quo, pretty much ensures that you don't have time to think about and actually build what you need to have sustained growth. That's exactly where I found myself. Took about six months, but with the help of a really great business coach and consultant, we've come out of that with an incredibly solid foundation, serious custom built project management system. I will talk ad nauseam about the joys of notion to anyone who will listen, and some strategic hires who are powering us into this next phase. I could sing all of their praises for another hour or more, But instead, I recommend heading to the team page and checking it out to learn more about them. In addition to our core team, we've also added a pretty robust roster of contributors to the site. And you know, when we put out a call for applications, we were overwhelmed by the quantity and quality of the submissions and really looking forward to showcasing their voices. And actually, if you're interested in potentially writing for He Spoke Style, leave me a comment and let's talk. So why does this matter? Ultimately, this next phase of HSS is all about you, our community. We wanna give you more of what you want, more of what you've asked for, more of what you've come to expect from us, and more of what you deserve. So now to you, I issue a call to action to take a look around at everything we've been doing on the new HSS site and all that it has to offer. And be sure to let us know what you think below in the comments. We hope you'll love it. Thanks as always for watching, welcome to the new He Spoke Style and stay tailored. Okay here is a little test footage and there's a cat. And this is a cat butt."

        "transcript": " As someone who's been into men's wear and men's style very publicly for over a decade now, you might think that I've got the whole how to dress and what to wear with fill-in-the-blank thing down. Now in some cases, I'd say that's true. You know, give me a suit or sport coat, and I can put some decent outfits together pretty quickly. But in other areas, especially more casual styles of dressing, it often doesn't come that easy. And the place where I feel like I I typically struggle the most is when it comes to styling leather jackets. I've often wondered why that is and we're going to explore that question. And I'm going to show you how I'm styling five different leather jackets this winter, right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa. This is He Spoke Style, Advice and Inspiration to Help You Dress Well, Develop Your Personal Style and Be More Confident. So you know that one of the things I value most when it comes to building my wardrobe is versatility. And I feel like leather jackets often come across as something of a one-trick pony. Like if you Google men's leather jacket outfits, what you see in the image results is, in general, basically all the same thing. You see a somewhat douchey looking guy in a leather biker jacket, wearing a t-shirt, two tight jeans and some type of boot, and maybe he's got a beard, but not like mine. I guess what I'm trying to say is that As someone who admittedly struggles in the what to wear with a leather jacket department, there's not a whole lot of inspiration out there to draw from. And I'm at the age where that whole rock and roll look isn't really going to work for me. Maybe you understand exactly where I'm coming from, or maybe not, but I decided to put this video together for three reasons. First I wanted to do it as a styling exercise for myself. You know, if you want to get better at something, you practice. The second reason was to inspire those of you who might be in the same boat as me. And finally was to help populate the internet with some leather jacket outfits for men that don't look like what you see when you do that Google image search. In just a minute, I'm gonna show you the five leather jackets I'll be styling and all their details and then we'll get into the six different outfit ideas. But first, I do wanna thank the jacket maker for sponsoring today's video and providing the leather jackets you're going to see. So if you've been around the channel for a while, You know that I've worked with the jacket maker before. I think they produce a really great leather jacket for a fraction of the price that you would pay for something similar from a designer brand. And certainly much better than a cheap leather jacket you get from a fast fashion brand. The jacket maker uses the best possible raw materials in their jackets, really nice full grain lateral leather, YKK hardware and all lined with high grade polyester and viscose. So you're not just getting a good looking jacket, you're getting a quality good looking jacket. Sizing is very inclusive, which I love, and they have sizes ranging from extra small all the way up to 4XL, and they also offer a full made to measure option. I have not tried that. One note on sizing from my personal experience is that I would take the next size up from your normal size in a jacket from the jacket maker. The first time I ordered, I ordered mediums because that's my usual size. They were just too tight on me, So going up a size into a large made a huge difference. Recently, the jacket maker has also expanded into footwear with a brand called Evaternity. You'll see this pair of suede chukkas in the outfit section of the video. All footwear are made with full grain leather, Blake stitch construction, and come in a wide range of standard sizes at a fair price. Eastpoke style viewers can save on any purchase from the jacket maker. All I've got to do is use code BRYANTEN to save 10%. You can check out the selection at thejacketmaker.com and I'll also have links to the jackets and boots down below in the description. All right, outfits in a moment, but first, let's take a brief look at each of the five leather jackets I'll be styling. Up first is the Koffner. It's made with a goat skin leather with a suede finish. Inside, it's fully lined in faux fur, which makes it incredibly warm. A removable fur collar adds to its versatility, a two-button closure on the cuff, zip-up closure, two inside pockets and two outside pockets. Next is the Aeron G1 Bomber, which I have in both dark brown and black. It's a sheepskin leather with a semi-aniline finish. There's a quilted inner lining, removable fur collar, rib-knit cuff, zip-up closure, two inside pockets, and two outside pockets with button closures. This is the Vaxston Varsity Jacket. Not a full leather jacket, but there are sheepskin leather sleeves along with a synthetic wool body. Now inside, we've got that quilted lining. snap button closure up the front, striped rib knit cuffs, two inner pockets, and two outer pockets. And finally we have the charcoal black suede biker jacket, goat skin leather with a suede finish, quilted inner lining, mandarin collar, zippers on the cuffs, and once again we've got our two inside pockets and two outside pockets. Those are the jackets. Now let's put some outfits together. For outfit number one, now I would consider this the grown-up version of that men's leather jacket outfit ideas image search I've referenced. So just swap the t-shirt for an OCBD, go with jeans in a more classic fit, some nice suede chukkas, and then finishing it off with the Coffner suede jacket with a shearling collar. I have always felt that one of the best ways to dress casually when you get a little older is to to wear something or multiple things in a more luxe material like the suede you see here. It instantly elevates the look and gives the impression that you know exactly what you're doing, even if you don't. One of the things I learned after going through this leather jacket styling exercise is that you can basically pair a leather jacket with just about any normal outfit you put together, including tailored clothing, so long as it is the right leather jacket. What you get when you hit it just right is a little bit of an edge and I would say cool factor for lack of a better term, to something that could seem just a little plain without it. Take this look for example. I've got a classic and exceptionally warm fishermen sweater paired with some charcoal flannel trousers. Simple, doesn't rock the boat, but add the leather jacket and throw in some Chelsea boots for good measure. And suddenly there's a bit more je ne sais quoi to the old thing. Here is a variation on the last theme this time with a black G1 bomber jacket featuring a white churling collar. I've really been feeling the darker grays and black thing the entire season in terms of color. It's easy, always looks good, and it gives you a sense of confidence and I'd say mystery too. It also makes it really easy to drop a leather jacket into the equation. Now what I really like about this particular combination is how it illustrates that you can wear, let's say, a more sophisticated outfit with a leather jacket. Rather than looking like it doesn't belong with a turtleneck, flannel trousers, and penny loafers, it adds a nice touch of sportiness and really changes the entire vibe. Alright, I hear you. The only thing leather about this varsity jacket are sleeves. That's enough for me though. Consider this one a bit of a palette cleanser as it really is the most generic of the six looks we've got here. Honestly, as much as I tried, nothing seemed more right than a simple and sporty styling with an athletic sweatshirt, light wash jeans, and good old white leather sneakers. Now I'm open to suggestions though if you've got some other ideas of how to style a varsity jacket like this, drop them down below in the comments. Now one of the approaches I took when styling these leather jackets was to embrace aspects of the quiet luxury trend. Here I've done that in two ways. First the lighter color palette of the Luxe Foundation. I guess I don't really need to understand why, but for whatever reason lighter colors almost always equate to a more luxurious look. It's a thing. And second, some more luxe fabrics. Cashmere CableNet Crewneck Sweater and some suede split toe derbies which tie into the color of the leather jacket quite nicely and really bring the whole outfit together. So there are people, maybe that's you, who say that you can't wear black and brown together. Well, here's another thumb in the eye from me to those who insist that much like oil and water, black and brown do not mix. I've said it before and I'll say it again, yes they do. Of course you've got to take into account the shades of brown and this outfit works because one, there is a nice progression of light to mid-tone, too dark, and two, the sweater against the black suede bomber does an incredible job of drawing your eye upward and framing my face which is one of the keys to any well put together outfit. All right so now is the time for you to give me a grade on my leather jacket styling, But remember two things. First, that admittedly styling leather jackets doesn't come as easy to me. And second, that all of these outfits, with the exception of the Varsity jacket, were in attempt to bring a little more sophistication to the styling. Oh, actually a third thing to remember too.

        "transcript": " You know, to be honest, I really envy the guy that has that one fragrance that he wears all the time. Like my good friend, Polo Green. That's it. Nothing else. I wish I could be that person because it would be so simple. But you know, anyone who goes deep down the rabbit hole of niche fragrances knows that's just not something we can do. There's so much out there to experience in that hunt for something really special and unique that you just immediately fall in love with. that's the best part of the whole thing. And in this video, I have five new niche fragrances that I just got very excited about and that I want to share with you today. I'm Brian Sakowit. This is He Spoke Style. Advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. So actually, let's start out just from an educational standpoint by answering four questions. What is a niche fragrance? Why do people buy niche fragrances are niche fragrances worth it and how do you find niche fragrances? So question number one, what is a niche fragrance? Why do we call it that? Niche fragrances typically made by small independent companies or perfumers thus the term niche. They often contain high quality rare and unique ingredients that you're not going to find in mass produced fragrances which is one of the biggest distinctions between a niche fragrance and say a designer fragrance. And as a result of both of those things, niche fragrances tend to be more expensive overall. Question number two, why do people buy niche fragrances? Well, the biggest reason that people love niche fragrances is simply because they're much more distinctive and have a more individualistic character compared to mass produced fragrances. There's a level of artistry in niche fragrances that you don't find in mass produced stuff. And it's that quality along with their uniqueness that really draws people to them. Now because they're typically more expensive, question number three, aren't niche fragrances worth it? So this is a question that I really can't answer for you, but in my experience I have always found that buying a niche fragrance and enjoying it is totally worth the price you pay for one. I really believe in buying quality and I have no problem paying a little extra for that quality. And I love using and wearing things that are well all crafted by people who are really artists and masters at what they do. And question number four, how do you find a niche fragrance? Well, videos like this for one, so you're definitely in the right place. Word of mouth is a great way to discover niche fragrances as well. There's a huge and very passionate community online and there really just a few Google searches away. Another great way to find niche fragrances is by exploring. If you live someplace that does have a nice boutique fragrance shop, just make a trip over there, talk to the people that work there, tell them what you like, smell some things, try some stuff on, really one of the best ways. Now I do often hear from you guys like, now I don't really live in a place with access to something like that, so that does pose challenges, especially at these types of price points. The last thing you want to do is drop a bunch of money to blind buy something that you've heard a lot about, but you know, at the end of the day, you really don't end up liking it. That's when it becomes really important to know where to look for a really well curated selection by people who share that same passion for fragrance as you do. And all five fragrances I have to review for you today came from a place like that. And that place is The Scent House, who I am proud to partner with for today's video. So The Scent House is actually a fragrance distributor. The brand was founded in 2021. They have a whole team of experts who are dedicated to discovering, representing and supporting high quality fragrance brands and specifically providing access to find European fragrance lines to select retailers here in the U.S. As I was getting ready for this video, I did post a photo of the lineup. I'll be reviewing to my Instagram stories. And a lot of people responded saying how great these brands were. They're new to me, but I'm glad that within the luxury niche fragrance community that these brands are brands that are definitely well regarded. Now, you don't buy fragrances directly from the scent house. They sell them via various online retailers and some physical stores, but since this video is highlighting some of the brands within their portfolio, I did tell them what I liked and asked for some recommendations just because I didn't really know many of these brands. And I was very impressed with the selections they made, which definitely speaks to the passion and knowledge of the people on their team. You can check out all the brands that they offer on their website, thecenthouse.com. Now, let's dive into the five fragrances I have right here. Beginning with this one right here in the beautiful blue bottle. This is Piazza Affari by Milano Fragranzi. Now, I always wonder whether I should pronounce things like an American or actually try to pronounce poorly in the real language so either way, don't make fun of me or go ahead, have at. But seriously, what's better? Let me know down below. Now, before I get into what this smells like, I do want to comment on this bottle. It's very heavy. It feels substantial. The glass seems to be very thick. Has a very heavy and ornate metal top, which sounds cool when you put it back on. Kind of like the ST Dupont ping. The brand is relatively new. It was founded in 2020. All the fragrances in their lineup have been designed to evoke the spirit of different places in Milan, and this one is the Piazza Affari, which is generally seen as the hub of all financial activity in Milan. This fragrance is almost brand new. It was released in 2022. It is an Oda Parfum, classified as an aromatic on the brand site and an Ambre Fugère on the sent house, which calls this particular fragrance, quote, the perfect picture of an Italian gentleman, elegant, refined, and well-dressed. Sounds like my kind of scent. Where is it? Ooh! So the first spray is fresh. I get some citrus, a touch of spice, so it definitely has that fougere quality that I really love in fragrance. As it does dry down, it takes on a more elegant character with vetiver and some woodsy notes. And it's not listed in the notes of this fragrance, but I do feel like there is a very slight amber softness to it on the dry down. This is a good one. I like it a lot. It's classic, but modern with a little assertiveness to it. Not much, but just enough. Next, I have the first of two fragrances that I got from Sospiro. This one is Basso from their Clasica collection and being a musician my entire life. I love all the musical references in their fragrances. I am not a Basso or bass. And I would say that this is perhaps misnamed because when you think of a bass opera singer, you think exactly of the first sentence in the description of this fragrance, which is quote, the sheer elegance of powerful deep sound. So I don't have a problem with elegance because this is a very, very elegant scent, but powerful and deep, I don't think quite capture how this truly smells. If I'm thinking something powerful and deep, I'm thinking, you know, in your face, And other than the very first spray of this, which does hit you in the face with some grapefruit, I find this to be extremely refined. As this dries down, there is a slight bit of carnation, which quickly passes. And what you're left with, in my opinion, despite all the base notes that they list, is a really lovely cedar. It reminds me very much of Terida Hermes, but more power than that if you're familiar with that sin. And just at the beginning, I thought that this was gonna be similar to Kriegler's blue escapade 24, but it does soften quite a bit more than the Kriegler does. And actually the Kriegler stays pretty even like the entire time you're wearing it. Mmm. All right, next. Also from Zospiro, I have Tenore, which is my voice type. Whoa! Now, I didn't mention this at all when I was talking about Basso, but I do need to call out this bottle design as well. Again, it's very heavy. It feels substantial. It's wrapped in green velvet, which looks beautiful paired with the gold-toned hardware. Also quite substantial and elegant as well. I only say that because you are paying a premium for an East fragrance like this. And I do think it's nice that you are getting a bottle that is as beautifully designed as the fragrance itself. So let's talk about that fragrance. And it is very different than Basso. So whereas Basso, I think, is a great everyday signature scent kind of fragrance, to Nora, I really feel is much more specific. In my notes that I wrote when I tested this out on my skin, what I wrote was, good for evening, sexy, silky, sticky. I almost don't know how to describe it. It's like I kind of just want to eat it, right? This one I will go through the notes on just because I really am having trouble conveying in concrete terms as you can tell what this smells like. So on the top, lavender and lemon, That's here and gone pretty quickly. Heart, got Lily of the Valley, resin, leather, and spicy clove. That's getting closer, and I think the resin contributes to that silky stickiness I mentioned. And base notes, wood, amber, musk, and patchouli. All makes sense, but kind of really hard to describe. Which makes this, in my opinion, a must smell. It's very distinct, and I think it would be an awesome fall, winter, evening, special, formal event kind of fragrance. Up next, Colonia Veneziana. This is by the merchant of Venice and is a very classic Colonia or citrus fragrance. The bottle is beautiful. You can see a very subtle light green pattern if you look at it just right, which is meant to evoke the old fabric manufacturing tradition of Venice. The green color feels masculine and also matches the citrus theme. And on the top of the silver cap, you can see the wind rose. With a very classic and simple fragrance like this, there's not really much to say. I mean, if you know classic Colonia fragrances, you kind of have a ballpark idea of what you're dealing with here. It's citrusy, it's fresh, it's light, it smells like it should. But the only thing that really comes into play with a fragrance like this is how long does it last? It's always a question when it comes to citrus fragrances, right? This one's pretty good. Two to four hour range, maybe a little more. really nice and elegant colonia. You could wear it day to night, just need to reapply. And the last one I have here is from the house of Martín Mika Lef. This is gin tonic, gin and tonic. This is another instance where you really get a sense of the care and passion that is put into every facet of this simply by looking at the bottle. It's a beautiful white frosted glass. The liquid you can see has a bit of a greenish-blue hue. Then wrapping around you have these like transparent shards contrasting the smooth frosted glass. And then on top another contrast with the black cap. I'm pointing out these really stark contrasts because if you read the description of this fragrance it really is meant to be a study in contrast and that description goes a cocktail of nobility in sport, classicism and avant-gardeism, transparency, and depth. So cool. I love to see that play out in the bottle design as well. So this one is interesting. It's light and fresh, which you'd expect based on the name. Also not surprising, there's a bit of an herbaceousness to it. It takes on a very different quality and becomes aromatic and much more distinct after that first spray. So I think this is a great everyday wear that smells familiar but distinct and intriguing at the same time. see more contrast. So let me know if you've tried any of these that I have here yourself, or if you've tried other fragrances by these brands, I'd be super interested to hear of someone who's always looking out for something new and unique. Thanks once again to the Centhouse for sponsoring this video and reminder that all these brands that I talked about are in the Centhouse portfolio. You can check them out. I'll link in the description as well on the Centhouse website that's thecenthouse.com"

        "transcript": " Every weekday morning starts with a 5 o'clock wake up. I know it might sound early, but I love the calmness I feel in the morning. This is the time of the day that I reserve exclusively for myself and to take care of myself. Everything I do from the time I get out of bed until I start my workday around 9 is designed to help me be relaxed, awake, and extremely productive. Once I get downstairs, the very first thing I do is to drink a glass of water. It's great for hydration and I find that a glass of water first thing in the morning actually helps to wake me up. Once I'm done with my water, it's time to make breakfast. But hold up, because my morning routine doesn't actually start in the morning. It begins the night before. So this is arguably the most important part of my morning routine and it happens the night before. What I do is to lay out everything I need the night before so I can just get up, come downstairs and get on with my day without having to think. So I get my workout clothes ready, put them in my gym bag, and leave the bag in the path that I'll take to go out the door. Next I lay out everything that I need to make my breakfast. Bowl, spoon, oatmeal, pecans, banana, measuring cup, wooden spoon, knife, and small pot on the stove, though the blueberries will stay in the fridge until the morning. Then I set out my workout drink, vitamins, and a glass for water. This whole process serves one important purpose, and that purpose is to reduce the friction that I would have in the morning if I hadn't done these things the night before. It makes it easier, there's less to think about, and there's absolutely no possibility that I'm going to forget something. I basically made this habit automatic and inevitable, which makes it easier. And all that stuff comes directly from a title called Atomic Habits, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a second. First, I need to make breakfast. Every morning I make a healthy breakfast of what I call power oatmeal. It's a recipe I picked up in my cycling years and is a great way to get fueled before my workout. It's half a cup of oatmeal, half a cup of blueberries, but I just kind of eye it, quarter cup of pecans, again just kind of eye it, and one banana sliced up. Once that's ready, I do the dishes right away and make my way over to the table to eat. One of the things I've adopted as a part of this routine is to have a strict policy of no social media, no email, and no news until I'm finished with my entire morning routine. Though the only exception is that I do play the wordle as soon as I sit down. I decided to cut all of that stuff out of my morning for two reasons. First, I found that it would derail me. I'd get distracted, and before I knew it, I'd wasted 15 perfectly good minutes or more doing I honestly couldn't tell you what. And second, I found that those things, particularly social media, would really put me in a bad mood and that's not the way you want to start your day. So the idea of getting off to a positive start and focusing on my mental health in that way was very important to me, especially now as I'm retiring and transitioning from my career in the army to doing his folk style full time. And in order to really hit the ground running with a lot of great positive habits to help set me up for success, I turned to Audible, today's video sponsor, and one of the recommendations that you guys have given me in the comments several times, Atomic Habits by James Clear. To say that this title changed my life would be an understatement. And what I really love about Atomic Habits is just how easy and actionable everything is. For example, and the thing I started applying immediately, are the four steps to creating and maintaining good habits. Number one is to make it obvious. you're arranging your environment so the thing that you strive for is right in front of you and the thing that's holding you back is completely out of sight. Number two is to make it attractive. You want to make that good habit more appealing by combining it with something you already love. So for example, if you want to exercise more, you might try listening to your favorite music while you work out. Number three is to make it easy. Big changes take time so what you want to do is to start small. Cleaning the entire house for example, that's overwhelming but meeting up my desk is a a lot more manageable. And number four is to make it inevitable. Make good habits part of your routine so they become automatic. Listening to atomic habits as well as other titles on Audible became and is a part of my morning routine and you'll see that part in the great share of my office that I sit in to do it later on in the video. And what I found is that audiobooks and audio itself as a medium has the power to boost my mood and help me disrupt those negative thinking patterns. In fact, Psychology Today said that for those of us prone to anxiety and depression, listening to someone else read aloud can help by replacing negative thoughts with something else. And in this case, the something else for me were a lot of positive habits that put me on the path to success as soon as I get out of bed. Now, no matter who you are or what you're into, Audible offers an incredible selection of audiobooks across every genre. As an Audible member, you can choose one title a month to keep from the entire catalog, including bestsellers and new releases. And members also get full access to a growing selection of audiobooks, audible originals, and podcasts. New members can try it free for 30 days. Visit audible.com slash espokestyle or text espokestyle to 500-500 to try audible free for 30 days. Now let's get moving. Once I finish my breakfast, the dishes go in the dishwasher. I take my vitamins, make my pre-workout drink, and set it at the end of the island so it's easy to grab on my way out. Then I head downstairs to my office, where the lights are already on from the automation I set up. I then head to the bathroom in the studio to get ready for the gym, brush my teeth, rinse with some mouthwash, and floss. Next I head back to my office to get dressed. I change into my workout clothes at the gym so I just throw on some joggers and a hoodie, which I've conveniently laid out on the valet the night before, along with some sneakers. I grab my Apple watch, top kit, wallet and phone, head back upstairs, grab my pre-workout drink and gym bag and get into my car. Now, once this happens, I feel like I've already won because everything else basically becomes automatic at this point. I'm gonna drive to the gym, I'm gonna do my workout, I'm gonna take a shower, et cetera, et cetera. So all of those things have literally become inevitable. So let's stop delaying the inevitable and get going. So I usually pull out of the house around 545 and 550. And it's a little bit less than a 15 minute drive to the gym. Currently we're kind of late spring time coming up on early summer and it's more or less completely late outside. I actually like it in the fall when it's in winter, when it's super dark, it's black. I don't know why, it's just, I just feel like it's so peaceful. Even though it's late out now, I still feel that same sense of the fun. Like I said at the beginning of the video, this time in the morning is time that I reserved exclusively for myself. There's no distractions. I'm focusing on things that I know are gonna make me feel good, make me healthy. and things that I know that are going to help me have an awesome day. All right, just pulled into the gym parking lot, going ahead inside and hit today's workout. I work out six days a week, Monday through Saturday, and I begin each workout with a short, easy half-mile jog inside to get warmed up. For my workouts, I use a strength and conditioning plan that I found on Train Heroic, which is a combination of classic strength and resistance training, body weight exercises, high intensity interval training and cardio, like rowing and jumping rope. Each workout takes between 45 minutes to an hour and I always spend an extra five minutes after the workout stretching. So once I finish my workout, I do like to shower at the gym for a few reasons. Number one, I hate being sweaty and nasty when I get back into the car. Number two, it's one less thing that I have to do when I get home so I can just transition into doing other things. And number three, I won't be in Robin's way when she's trying to get ready for work as well. Before I turn the car on, this is what I do. I sit back, I close my eyes, and I take several deep breaths. While I'm doing this, I'm just sort of meditating, listening to everything around me, feeling grateful. And I do this until I start smiling. It's a small thing that takes hardly any time at all, but it's so worth it. Then I turn the car on and drive home. And while I'm driving home, I'm also expressing gratitude. I love where we live, it's beautiful, there is so much for us to be thankful for. Once I'm home and have settled in, I head back down to my office, I will light a candle and then sit down in my chair, put my headphones in and spend up to 30 minutes listening to an audiobook. This is a very important ritual. Not only does it help me center myself, but it also inspires and sparks a great deal of creativity. Once I'm finished listening to my audio book, I go to my desk and start my day. I've been using a digital planning app called Sonsama that I really love because it allows me to block my time, track the time I spend on tasks, and gives me access to the most important things I need all in one spot so I'm not frantically toggling between various apps and tabs. Now this is the very first time that I will check my email. I give myself 10 to 15 minutes to scan through, delete what I don't need and respond to what's most important. And once that's done, I'm ready to jump in and start my day. Many thanks once again to Audible for sponsoring this video. Reminder that new members can try it free for 30 days.

        "transcript": " Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Yes, my friends, there is a sweater for every day of the week and there is a sweater for every kind of occasion. So let's talk about some different styles of sweaters, when you should wear them, and how you should wear them. I've got eight different sweaters in total for this video, all different styles, along with 12 different outfit ideas. So if it's inspiration you're after, you've come to the right place. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style. Advice and inspiration help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. This video is sponsored by Proper Cloth and all the sweaters I'll be featuring in this video are Proper Cloth sweaters. Now, a lot of you are probably already familiar with Proper Cloth. It's a brand that's really well known and well regarded in the menswear space, particularly for their luxury materials, quality construction, and exceptional fit. Custom shirts have sort of been proper cloths bred in butter for a while. They've really worked hard to refine their process with their smart sizes technology, and that has made it faster and easier than ever to order high quality custom shirts that are perfectly tailored for you. In addition to shirts, proper cloth also has a large selection of pants, sport coats, suits, and formal wear. A lot of guys I talked to at pity this past January were wearing proper cloth garments And I have to say that stuff looked really fantastic. And now proper cloth has added a knitwear collection. All of the pieces are designed, of course, to be high quality and versatile. Both of those things, music to my ears. And as I've gotten to really get to know these garments over the past few weeks, in addition to their versatility, I've been impressed with all of their thoughtful details, superior construction, and just the effortless, sophisticated sensibility that they have. Not to mention the fit because that should be the most important thing you look for when you're buying a sweater. You want it to be a Goldilocks thing, right?

This sweater, the chunky shawl cardigan is honestly the sweater I've been looking for my entire life. It feels super luxurious. It's a very soft thick blend of merino wool and cashmere, 85% merino wool, 15% cashmere. It has an English rib knit construction with ribbed finishes. Of course, we've got the wonderful shawl collar, two patch pockets, and four buttons, which are made with Italian genuine horn. In terms of styling, the sweater is incredibly versatile, though I have to say that probably my favorite way to wear it is as an everyday around the house sweater, but let's take a look at a couple different ways to style it. Up first, we have what my friends in the UK would call smart. simple styling here, white poplin shirt, like gray flannel pants, black tassel loafers, and on my wrist, the JLC Reverso. One thing I want to mention is that I decided to size up for this sweater. All the other pieces you'll see are mediums, this one is a large, and I did that deliberately. For this type of sweater, I prefer a bit of an oversized fit. I think you can see that this fits a little looser, but definitely doesn't look sloppy. A sweater like this, I think, should just feel really cozy, kind of like a blanket you're wrapping yourself in. And I think having it slightly oversized really plays into that relaxed feel that it projects. Here I have it styled much differently, very casual, and this is sort of the around-the-house thing I was talking about. Underneath the sweater I've got a Heathered oatmeal t-shirt wearing untucked, paired with some slightly worn in selvedge denim, white common project sneakers, and Cartier Tank American on the wrist. The sweater gives this very casual look, a bit of an elegant and sophisticated feel, even though it's casual. When I'm styling it like this, I tend to wear it unbuttoned so it feels relaxed and maybe I'd pop the collar for a little bit of panache. The second sweater is the one I'm currently wearing. This is the Aaron Turtleneck inspired by the traditional Irish fishermen sweaters. This is a medium heavyweight knit made from a blend of premium Italian yarns, 70% merino wool, 25% mohair, and 5% cashmere. You've got that beautiful and intricate purl stitch detailing and a ribbed turtleneck, which is a warm and welcome addition to the traditional fisherman's sweater. In addition to the beige color I'm wearing, it is also available in navy and a lovely burgundy color. Three different looks here, smart, casual, and sporty, and will kick things off with some smart styling. So I've paired the turtleneck with some mid-gray flannel pants, JLC Reverso on a brown strap, and some brown suede chukka boots to sort of play into the work wear heritage of the air and sweater. Now, when it comes to sweaters, especially a sweater like this that just looks so interesting, you don't really have to do much other than build the outfit simply around that interesting piece. Having a simple foundation will allow that piece to really stand out and be the focal point. Next, a little more casual. Instead of flannels, I've got a medium blue pair of denim along with some dark brown suede zip-up boots. This is an outfit I would wear on the weekend, you know, maybe just going out to a casual brunch with friends. And then we have the look I'm wearing right now, casual, but also a little sportier, swapping out the mid-blue jeans for a lighter pair and the suede boots for some white common project sneakers and also bringing out the heavy hitter on the wrist. Next, another piece inspired by the traditional fisherman's sweater. This is the proper cloth Aaron Kruenig. Same exact makeup as the previous sweater, Reno wool, Mo hair and cashmere blend with all of the intricate cabling and purl stitch detailing. Also available in the same three colors though, I really love it in this deep burgundy for the season. Here it is in a business casual styling. I've layered the sweater over a burgundy striped shirt and paired that with some mid-grey flannel pants, brown suede split-toe derbies, and the JLC Reverso to finish it off. I don't think there's a better combination for the season than a cable knit sweater, flannel pants, and suede shoes. There's something sophisticated and effortless about it that really draws people in even though it's not really in your face. For our fourth sweater, we have a True Luxe Wardrobe Essential, a cashmere turtleneck. It is 100% cashmere made from premium Scottish Todd and Duncan Yarns. It's a company that's been around and in business for over 150 years and fully fashioned construction available in five different colors. I mean, what can you say about a cashmere turtleneck like this? It's classic, must-have piece, incredibly versatile though, let me show you one of my favorite ways to style it. Now, this is for the guy who complained recently that I haven't been featuring enough suits on the channel. You know, in the colder months, when I think, I want to wear a suit, I want to be elegant, I want it to have a sophisticated feel, but still feel somewhat relaxed, this is what I do. Keep it simple. Double-breasted chalk stripe flannel suit, charcoal cashmere turtleneck, black leather tassel loafers, and an effortlessly elegant watch. It's a formula, works every time, no updates necessary. Up next, we have another cashmere essential, the cashmere crew neck. Same specs as the turtleneck. It's 100% cashmere from Todd and Duncan. Super soft and comfortable, very versatile and available in a wide range of colors on the proper cloth website. Here is the first of two outfits featuring the sweater starting off with something on the smart side. Underneath the sweater, a simple white poplin shirt paired with some brown chinos, classic brown captoes and the Vacheron traditionelle on the wrist. You know, Burgundy and brown is such a great color pairing, one of my favorites, as a matter of fact. They're both muted, earthy tones that project warmth and a subtle luxuriousness. And brown, I think, you know, you don't see enough of. So again, it really stands out in the most unassuming way. Next, toning down the dressiness just a touch for something more in the smart casual realm, swapping out the chinos for some medium blue jeans, adding a plaid flannel sport coat, and some pebble grain wingtip brogues. The burgundy sweater really adds a nice splash of color. It adds some depth as a layering piece and really pulls the entire outfit together. Sweater number six is the half zip sweater. This is made from a wool and silk blend 75% merino wool and 25% silk which means it's soft comfortable and lightweight making it a perfect piece for those seasonal transitions. Details we have a ribbed collar, cuffs and hem along with a polished Italian lampeau zipper. Now obviously tons of ways to style this particular sweater but I wanted to do something kind of on the preppy side and here's what we've got. So underneath the sweater we've got a classic bangle striped shirt paired with some cacichinos and brown cordovan penny loafers. It's very kind of as they say these days and old money look. It's preppy, it's got a dash of sportiness, it's easy and it's effortless and it's a reminder that less Yes, really is more 99.9% of the time when it comes to classic style. Now look like this, you can dress up even more. All you got to do is add a tie and yes, we are now in full prep mode. Next up we have the full zip cardigan. This particular sweater is made from 100% merino wool and what I like about this particular fabric is not only that it is very soft and comfortable, but that it has a medium weight to it so it feels substantial, has a little more structure, which makes it a great alternative to a jacket in those seasonal transitions. Also to that point, it's got two side pockets which are very practical. Now you can really think of the full zip cardigan as the sportier sibling of the classic button cardigan. And you can also use it as a replacement for a sport coat and that's exactly what I was thinking when I put this look together. It's a more casual and relaxed approach for, you know, when you want to be dressed up but don't necessarily feel like wearing a jacket. Outfit details. Underneath the sweater I've got a micro stripe OCBD paired with some stone cotton pants, light brown derbies, light brown belt, and a Vacheron traditionnelle on the wrist. Definitely more of a springtime vibe here with the lighter shirt and pants. Simple, classic, and very easy to put together. It's a look that never goes out of style. And then we have sweater number eight, the Merino and Cashmere Hoodie, made from a blend of 85% Merino wool and 15% Cashmere. This is not your typical athletic hoodie sweatshirt. It is much more refined, much more mature. We've got that super soft fabric, some beautiful ribbing on the hood, the cuffs and the hem, and of course the classic hoodie pocket. But this is a piece that I would consider adding if you are looking to develop that grown-up casual side of your wardrobe. And here's how I typically wear this piece, just layered over a simple t-shirt paired with some light wash jeans, common project sneakers, and speedy with a mesh strap on the wrist. I've got a whole video on how to dress casually as an adult that is linked right up there, but one of the key points I talk about in that video, and one of the easiest ways to elevate the casual look, whether you're an adult or not, is to have some of these basic pieces in a more luxe fabric. It's a small change that makes a huge difference in the vibe and outfit projects. It looks more put together. It looks richer, but it also really affects the way you feel. And feeling great, as you know, is really the key to looking great. As I mentioned, there are so many different ways you can style sweaters. And if you're still looking for more inspiration after this video, I've put together a playlist right over there with some sweater specific videos with 20 additional looks that you could try out. Also want to give a big thanks once again to proper cloth, for sponsoring this video. Reminder, you can check out their entire knitwear collection at the link in the description.

        "transcript": " Now let me know when you're ready. I will look right at the camera. We're good. Okay, so ready to do this. There comes a time in any career I think when you get to a certain point, you take a look around and you're like, you know what? I think I'm done. You just feel like, you know, I've done a lot. I've accomplished a lot. met some great people, made some great connections, felt like I've actually contributed something to the world and just kind of feeling like I've got nothing left to prove here and there's no further that I want to take this. I've had this experience in my life before in a couple different situations. So I used to run a modern classical music series in Baltimore, did that for five years, started very small and we actually ended up growing it into something that was quite successful. We got a lot of great press, won a national award for adventurous programming. I loved doing it. It was fun, but after five years, I kind of got to the point where I was ready to move on. So I did. Had that same sort of situation during my days as a bicycle racer. Raced for almost 10 years. I was a cat one, which is the top level you can achieve in amateur cycling. Won some races, time trials, that was my thing. Loved racing for the team and using my skills to help set the other guys up for success. But it kind of wore on me after a while, you know, to be competitive at that level was a full-time commitment. And I remember the day, the exact moment, and exactly where I was. It was just after the racing season ended. I was just out for like a nothing ride. I was going up this little hill. I slumped over my handlebars and I said, I can't do this anymore. So you might think that after putting so much time and work and effort into both of those things that I might feel some regret about leaving or at the very least have some kind of doubts about whether or not I was making the right decision. But I'll tell you that in both of those situations, when I made that decision, I had absolutely no regrets. In fact, I actually felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I honestly felt free and genuinely excited for whatever the next thing was gonna be. So it just so happened that the next thing for me after the music series and bicycle racing was He Spoke Style. It was the fall of 2012 when I stopped doing the music series and retired from racing. And then I launched He Spoke Style. Very first post was February 17th, 2013. And we'll get back to that post. But first, you may have noticed that we just kind of passed a 10 year anniversary and there was nothing to market. Nothing here on the channel, nothing on the website, Nothing on social. And that's what I wanna talk about. Because I've been having those feelings again that I talked about at the beginning of this video. I've accomplished a lot, made some great connections, felt like I contributed something to the world, nothing more to prove, ready to move on to the next thing. So that's why I have decided to retire from the army. Yes, that's right. Now, some of you probably know that I have been and currently still am, don't want the beard fool you, an active duty soldier in the United States Army. But for those of you who are like, what? Let me just get you up to speed. So for the last almost 20 years, I've served as a member of the United States Army Field Band from Washington, DC. Played the saxophone with the group and I know some of you have come to the channel and asked, hey, are you that same guy in those Army Field Band videos? Yes, that's me and proud to have been in a couple of the most popular videos that the Army Field Band ever made. Playing the saxophone was not the only thing I did with the Army Field Band. I was also very involved for the last 10 years or so in public affairs and strategic communications. For a long time, I was a go-to spokesperson for the group, so I do interviews, you know, anything from newspaper, online, radio, podcast, television, I did it. Over the past few years, I've been training our people to do that, so love doing those sorts of things as well. I also worked a lot to get media coverage for the group, a few of the things that I'm most proud of was a huge story that we had on AP News as well as national coverage on CBS Evening News with Nora O'Donnell and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt. In addition to that, I was also the announcer for the group for a number of years. Absolutely love that role. So much fun to be in front of an audience, connect with them and you know, pretty much like set the conditions for them to enjoy the show. I mean, I did other little things too. Those were kind of the big things in the span of my career. And it was great. And there were a lot of things that I truly loved about it. I loved playing music for people. And honestly, I got to the point where I didn't care where I played, who I was playing for, or what I was playing, as long as those people weren't entertained, inspired, or moved in some way, which I know happened every single concert. I loved working with such amazing musicians and people. You know, some of the people I won't miss as much as others, but you know, I guess that's how it goes anywhere. Been to all 50 states overseas a few times. It was a really great career, but it was time to leave. The schedule for the group is challenging. Typically on the road about 100 days of the year. If any of you have ever served in the military, you know your daily schedule can be very unpredictable. That was fine for a while, but you know, you just sort of roll with it, but it gets kind of stressful over time. And as you move through a career in the military, you transition into something other than what you were hired to do specifically. And that's usually a managerial type of role. I love mentoring people, but there were elements of upper level management that weren't really my favorite thing to deal with, especially in a highly corporate environment where it's more like steering an aircraft than driving a Ferrari. So that was very frustrating to me. Overall though, my decision to retire from the Army after 20 years, two months and 29 days, was for two very big reasons. The first was to be home and to be able to spend more time with Robin and my family. It's really hard to be away from home for so long and I just didn't wanna do that anymore. And the second reason is to finally be able to devote 100% of my time to he spoke style. So when I started this 10 years ago, it was kind of easier to keep up with. I didn't have quite as many responsibilities in my army career as I've had the last three, four, or five years. And it really has gotten incredibly difficult to balance. So instead of spending 100% of 10% of my time on HSS, it will be 100% of 100% of my time. And also, Rob is actually retiring from the Army too. He is right there behind the camera right now. So I know that we are both looking forward to making this a full-time thing. So my actual retirement date, my last day in the Army, is October 31st of this year. My retirement ceremony is May 10th. There's a lot involved in retiring and boxes that you need to make sure you check. So there is a bit of a transition period. I'm using that time now, which is why you may notice a little bit of a lull in our content creation at this point, to do some things that are really going to set us up for success, growth, and really being able to scale into the future. Right now, we are working with a consultant to map all of our processes, develop SOPs for everything, and that'll help with hiring training in the future, and to really dig into our project management, refine that process, and implement some things in our software is that we used to make the whole thing just much more streamlined and efficient. It's something I probably should have done a long time ago, but you know, I was doing the best that I could. So in addition to really getting dialed in here on the channel, the other big news is that the HSS website and shop will be getting a complete makeover. We just signed a contract with an incredible web design and development agency to make that happen. It's probably gonna be in the four month range for the entire product start to finish, but the experience both on the editorial side and the commerce side is going to be absolutely amazing. From a personal point of view, having started He Spoke Style originally as a website, I'm really looking forward to kind of getting back to basics in terms of that part of how we tell stories and reach people. There'll be a lot of synergy between the channel, the website, and the shop. So speaking of the website, earlier in the video, I mentioned the very first post that I ever did on He Spoke Style, and I wanna come back to that right now. So one of the things that I'm most proud of having done this now for 10 years, is that the message has remained consistent. In this whole influencer world, you see people kind of jumping from one thing to the next. You just kind of wonder, what do they really stand for? That's really never been my thing. For me, it's always been about the journey and helping people on their own journey to understand the transformational power of dressing well. As evidence, here is a little bit of what I wrote in that very first post. It seems easy enough, but can certainly be overwhelming. With so many choices, options, and opinions, it can definitely be difficult to know where to start, what to do, and how to do it. But like anything, investing little thought and time pays big dividends. I started this blog to offer style inspiration, tips, advice, and answers to common, as well as detail-oriented menswear and grooming questions. As a starting point for guys interested in developing a menswear collection or refining their personal style, it should be fun. It should be fun and it will be fun and I thank you for all the support over the years that has made He Spoke Style what it is today. More good things to come, stay tuned."

        "transcript": " I love getting dressed up and you know that's typically what you see most of here on the channel but you know there are some real life situations where that just isn't practical or advisable. For example, I'm not going to be outside playing with the dog in a tuxedo. I'm not going to be working out at the gym in a suit and I'm not putting on a sport coat and tie just to take out the trash. Let's be real. As Robin and I have eased into country living you know certain aspects of my day-to-day style have evolved. And those of you who know me here, may be surprised to see my real, real life, everyday outfits. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. So you know who's not gonna like this video? The guy who left this comment recently. I mean, I guess it's a reasonable question, and you know, you can read my answer, but basically what it boils down to is that we all evolve. Style is a journey, you know. And one of the fun things to do if you happen to have been chronicling your style journey online for over a decade is to go back in the time machine and see what you thought about things previously. Now I know that years ago I covered the topic of athleisure on the website. So why don't we take a trip down memory lane and see exactly what it was that I actually said. So here we are all the way back on May 18th, 2015, and two of the choice opinions that I shared in that particular post are the following. I said that quote, among the more egregious trends of late is the ridiculously named athleisure trend,\" going further and saying that, I would hope that since athleisure has reached something of a fever pitch that it will begin to fade into the annals of fashion misses. But wait, there's more. In a follow-up post a little more than a year later from June 1st, 2016, which was based on an interview that I gave to the Wall Street Journal about athleisure, I said, quote, I understand the reactive nature of the athleisure trend, but I don't find it to be a positive development for men's style.\" And then I continued by saying that, quote, athleisure is sending guys a huge cultural mixed message. So are we saying that it's okay to look like a slob now? End quote. So I had some pretty harsh words for athleisure back in the day and it's actually pretty amusing to go back and read those thoughts. But you know this was a different time in my style journey and it was a different time for athleisure. This was the time when dressy dressy sweatpants were the thing. And yeah, it did feel like guys were starting to give up. But athleisure has come a very long way since the dressy sweatpants era. There have been a lot of advancements made with these garments, both practical and aesthetic, that have really changed the game in terms of style, to the point where even previous non-believers are reconsidering and changing their opinions about it. And one brand that has done an absolutely exceptional job with this is Public Rec, who I am proud to partner with for this video. There are six specific pieces I want to highlight before we get to the outfit portion of the video, beginning with one of their best sellers, the Public Rec All Day Everyday Pant. Now these are not sweatpants, but the thing people love about sweatpants is that they're comfortable, right? Not to say that jeans, chinos, or suit pants aren't comfortable, but it's a little different, you know? mission was to combine the comfort of sweatpants into something that looked as good as a pair of chinos. You know, something elevated that you could wear out, not look like a slob, but had that soft stretchy comfort. So enter the all-day everyday pant and I have to tell you that the first time I tried these on, the exact words that came to me were, holy crap, these are ridiculously comfortable. In terms of features, they've got an elastic waistband with an internal drawstring, two front zipper pockets. And what I like about these is that they run down the side so there's a very clean line down the leg which gives them kind of a sporty feel. In addition to the front pockets we've got two generous back pockets as well and then a faux fly front which gives them a more elevated look and again making them a much more stylish alternative to sweatpants. The fit is absolutely fantastic. They're perfect in the waist, they've got the perfect length, I think the taper is great and you are able to choose both your waist size and your inseam. So getting a perfect fit is much, much easier. I think these are great travel pants. We'll talk a little bit more about that later in the video, but also great for everyday errands when sweatpants are just too casual. Up next we have the Go-To Henley and Go-To refers to a custom fabric blend of 69% pima cotton for softness, 23% tensile for durability, and 8% spandex for stretch. This is your classic Henley. I'm wearing a size medium. I really like the fit. The fabric feels like a performance fabric, but it doesn't look like a performance fabric, which is nice because you kind of get the best of both worlds. Comfort and performance without sacrificing style. Next piece is the Elevate Mocneck Polo. This is made with a fabric they call Pro TX2. X2, I think that's how you say it. And it's a fabric that is antibacterial, anti-microbial, anti-mold, anti-mildew, and anti-oater protection. Feels really soft, but it's working really hard for you. Again, great fit, size medium for me. I like that it has that performance feel, but that it's not tight because, you know, not everyone has a perfect body. Next up is the Brave the Elements Shell. This is honestly one of my favorite casual sporty jackets. It's completely waterproof, uses a C6 water-dependent coating, so you've got full protection from water and wind. Two front zipper pockets, a hidden chest zipper pocket inside, bonded seams, and a collapsible hood. Super awesome fit. I love the design. I like that it's sporty, but not trendy. Almost has kind of a timelessness to it. Awesome springtime jacket. great for that upcoming seasonal transition period. Next item is the Waffle Knit Hoodie. It's your classic hoodie. The waffle knit fabric does have thermal properties, so it helps keep your body heat in without adding any extra bulk. It's got a great fit, it's athletic but relaxed. I like the texture of it and you'll notice that it does not have that usual front pocket, which gives it a bit of a cleaner look. Last piece to show you is the Public Rec Workday Pant 2.0. more classic five pocket style compared to the all day, everyday pant. Also the fabric, which is water and wind resistant, is a little bit lighter. It's got belt loops, a front zipper fly and a hidden back zipper pocket. Honestly, I wasn't prepared to like this one. It's a different color than I usually wear, but after wearing it some, I have to say that it's not half bad. Outfits are up next, but I do want to let you know that new public rec customers can save 10% off by using code BRYANTEN. I have links down below in the description to all the pieces featured. So click there, check them out, and try it out for yourself. Now let's take a look at five of my real life casual outfits. Here we go with look number one. I've got the Waffle Knit hoodie paired with the all day everyday pants. Over that I am layering a gray Tweet herringbone sport coat, white leather sneakers, and the speedy on the wrist. This is one of my go-to airport outfits. I know in the past I've argued for a more sartorial approach to air travel, but when it comes to long haul overseas flights, especially those that might include a flat lay seat, there is something to be said for maximum comfort. I've always loved combining sporty pieces with more tailored clothing, and this is a really great illustration of exactly how I like to do that. Look number two, similar idea with mostly black, sportier approach. I've got the Henley paired with the all day everyday pant, And over that, the Brave the Elements shell. Black baseball cap, same way sneakers, same watch, but adding a pair of chunky black sunglasses. This is what I call my Hollywood incognito look. I don't know, when I wear this, I feel like a movie star who doesn't want to be recognized. It's definitely sporty and because it features so much black, it is quite statement making. Next, look number three, super classic casual combo. I've got the gray Henley, paired with a pair of khaki all day, everyday pants, braid the elements shell, white sneakers, and speedy once again. Now, not to steer the subject away from style, but this will make sense. So I have been reading Tiago Forte's second brain book, highly recommended by the way, thanks Ian. And there's a part of the book where he shows this famous series of 11 illustrations by Pablo Picasso. The first one is a detailed drawing of a bull, and with each successive scotchy, He keeps distilling the form of the bowl down to its most basic elements. And the final sketch, which is really just a couple of lines, is probably the most pleasing of the entire series. I mentioned that not because I think this look is Picasso-esque, but rather to illustrate that it is very basic. And there is something pleasing aesthetically when you break style down into its most basic form. And that's why I always say, fill your closet with great basics, you can never go wrong. much more casual approach with look number four. We've got the Elevate Mach-Nec Polo paired with the same khaki all day, everyday pants. Over that and all the green work shirt, club masters, white sneakers and speedy. One little style tip to point out here, and it's kind of a good rule of thumb to have in mind when you're putting any outfit together, has to do with color tones. Now there are exceptions, but in general, You want to think about color in three different tiers. You want a lighter color, you want a darker color, and you want something in the middle. And you can see that that plays out here in order with the pants, mock polo, and work shirt. Look number five, simple. We've got the waffle knit hoodie paired with the Workday Pant 2.0. Jacques Marie-Marche sunglasses, common project sneakers, and on the wrist, my Apple Watch. That's right, I have an Apple Watch and if you want the story on that, let me know in the comments. But back to the look. Now, I did say that I was a little surprised by this one, but pleasantly surprised. I don't wanna make a huge deal out of this, but this particular color for pants was kind of a stretch for me, but I like it. And I think it's a really nice dose of contrast when you take a look at the outfit as a whole. Now, whenever I post a video about my casual style, I always get comments and questions about how one should dress casually as an adult. And it just so happens that I have put all of my thoughts about that into that video right over there. So click there to find out exactly what I think and how to pull it off. And finally, I wanna thank Public Rec for sponsoring this video and reminder that new Public Rec customers can save 10% by using promo code BRYANTEN."

        "transcript": " Today I'm here in Washington DC to meet up with a great friend of mine who's getting married very soon and by very soon I mean next month. So we've got to get a move on. I'm gonna help him pick out his wedding attire and to do that We're going to suit supply Well, here we are. It's good to see you. I'm surprised you recognize me with the beard and everything. You've changed a lot since we last met. So I'm here with my very good friend Scott Devereaux. We've known each other for eight years now, playing together in the United States Army Field Band. Scott is a tuba player. And we've been roommates when we've been on the road for, well, the entire time we've been here, so eight years. You're the only roommate I've ever had, Brian. now and now I'm getting a new room. You're getting married. You have a new roommate on the road because your future wife is also in the Army Field Manor, right? Exactly. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about how you guys met, your story. So we met at work and we've been friends for a really long time and then our friendship turned into something more. So I'm really excited to transition from rooming with one great friend to rooming with my future wife. Awesome. I've known you both of you guys for a very long time and I'm so excited for you guys to get married and we're here today to help you try and pick out the best wedding outfit. Now I know you have a little bit of an idea of what you're looking for but we're gonna what I'm gonna do is put together four different looks. We're gonna go through a few different dress codes, four different dress codes to be specific, black tie, creative black tie, formal and dressy casual. We'll get you all set up and see which one you like best. How's that sound? That sounds great to me. Alright, so here we are with option one, black tie, very classic look. We're going with a midnight blue tuxedo here because you said you didn't want black because... Didn't want it to feel like a musician at work. You didn't want to feel like you were going to go play the tuba. You're getting married. So, really nice midnight blue. We have a grosgrain peak lapel, matching bow tie here, cotton PK shirt, and instead of a Cumberbund, we're going with the vest here. I think it's a really great look with a patent leather Oxford. How do you feel on this? Feels great. I mean, you look like a million bucks. Feel like a million. Great option. So how about we try option two now? Let's do it. All right. Here we are, option two. I absolutely love this. It's a version of black tie, which we'll call creative black tie, so you can do things a little bit different. I think the gray dinner jacket looks fantastic. We have a self-facing shawl lapel. This is a cotton silk fabric. Self-facing button, jetted pockets. You said you wouldn't have chosen this for yourself. Yeah, it feels great now that I have it on. I wasn't expecting to like it, but I do. I think it looks fantastic. Now instead of doing the classic tuxedo shirt and bow tie, we're going with the turtleneck here, which I think is great for, it looks very elegant, very chic. We're going with a black tuxedo trouser here, patent leather oxfords once again. I think this is a great look. It's gotta be in the running. Yeah, it is. All right. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. need to nail the basics. That's a tailored suit, dress shirt, and a tie, and I think we've got it down pat right here. So color-wise, we're doing something very classic. We've got a charcoal gray suit. You can never go wrong with that. We've got a notch lapel here, so very classic as well. Conservative flat pockets. It's a two button. Crisp white dress shirt, white pocket square to match, and then we've got a little bit of a off white cream in color knit tie, which I think is great. It adds a little bit of texture into the look. Now, it is formal, so we are doing a formal finishing on the trouser bottom. It's no cuff. And then kind of taking the formality down just slightly with the color of the shoes. They're not a deep brown, but I think it's a really nice in between, could be perfect for your event. Option four, we have dressy casual. Now there are many ways that you can go with dressy casual, but let's talk about what we've got going on here. So we've got a flannel sport coat and a nice sand color, beautiful. We've got a natural shoulder here, notch lapel, jetted pockets and a three roll two. But underneath, we've got it paired with a simple white OCBD, again keeping it kind of casual. Now we're wearing a light gray flannel VBC fabric trouser. Now this has a single reverse pleat. We've got side adjusters instead of belt loops. The bottom finishing here, we've got a four centimeter hem also looks really casual. Drapes really well with this fabric. On your feet, we have a dark brown suede derby with a wingtip and broguing. Underneath giving a little bit of depth here, we've got this vest, which has a little bit of personal meaning to you. Absolutely. So we've got our four options. I think it's going to be tough to make a choice, but why don't you get changed and we'll see what you come out with. Alright, now for the moment of truth, deciding which outfit it's going to be. Option one, we had black tie, full tuxedo, midnight blue, super timeless and classic, always a great choice. Option two, creative black tie, dinner jacket, little more casual than a tux, still very formal, very chic. Very chic. Option three, formal look with a suit. Great option, especially with a perennial suit. You can wear it again and again and again. And finally, number four, we had dressy casual, sport coat, odd trousers, and the addition of a vest. So, what's it gonna be? So the first look, I really love the color. The midnight blue is a twist on something that I wear a lot in a tuxedo, but the blue really set it off for me. I love how I felt on that one. Number two was actually kind of a surprise for me, because I would never choose to wear a turtleneck personally, but once I put it on, it felt really great. It's kind of turned into a dark horse. Number three, felt super polished, classic suit. I loved it. Fourth look, I really love because it fits the vibe that we're going for. It's really casual, but also adventurous. And I also love all the textures involved in that look. It's really nice. And I love incorporating the sentimental piece that means a lot to our relationship. So what's it gonna be? Well. Drum roll. to go with the fourth look. I think it's a great option. I love everything you said about it. I love that there's a sentimental attachment you have with it. You're gonna look great. Thanks. So one thing I wanted to say is that so something I'd like to do for you as a gift for your wedding and we really thank Suitsupply for this as well is you looked great in everything so we're actually gonna give you all four of the looks. Oh wow that's that's really amazing. So if you change your mind between now and then, you'll be able to see. So I'm really thankful for our friendship. I wish you and Erica all the best. So yeah, can't wait for it. No, thanks, Brandon. I appreciate that."

        "transcript": " All right, here's the situation. It's February and Robin and I are gonna be spending a weekend in New York City. We're gonna take the train because it's quick, it's easy and it's relaxing. And while we're up there, these are the things we're gonna be doing. Cocktails and a nice meal, just the two of us. Walking around, maybe doing some shopping, dinner with a couple friends, a really nice restaurant, an early brunch, and then finally heading home. So let's get packing. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. So in this video, I'll be showing you what I'm gonna pack for this very specific situation. I'll go through the basics, those essential things that I always have to have with me when I travel. I'll show you the specific clothing, shoes, and accessories that I'll be packing. I'll do a rundown of each individual outfit I'll be bringing, and finally, I'll show you how I actually pack it all. Now, although this is very specific to my particular situation, If you follow the framework that I laid out at the beginning of the video, it'll be very easy for you to adapt it to your specific needs when you're planning your next trip. The first thing to consider is when you are going. What season is it? What's the weather gonna be like? It's the first step in planning what to pack. Second, how long you going for? This will start to help you focus in on the amount that you'll need to pack, how big of a bag you're gonna need, and also some specifics like how many pairs of underwear you should bring. Third, where are you going? Different destinations require different clothes. So what I bring for a weekend in the city is gonna be very different than what I bring for a weekend ski trip. Fourth, how are you traveling? Car, bus, train, plane? That impacts not only the type of luggage you'll bring, but also the outfit you wear when you travel. And finally, and probably most importantly, what are you going to be doing while you're on that trip? Knowing your itinerary, where you're going, where you're eating, the dress code, or vibe of each of those things is essential to planning each specific outfit for your trip. And planning ahead is what this all really boils down to. Knowing when you're going, where you're going, how long you're going for, how you're traveling, and what you're gonna be doing makes it so much easier to pack more effectively and efficiently. All right, so now let's actually talk about the basics and I'm gonna head over to the desk to talk through those things beginning with my luggage. So the bag I'm gonna take is this rolling carry-on. It's very lightweight. It's got plenty of room. The two dividers here make it really easy to secure everything inside. It's very easy to stow and both the telescoping handle and the wheels make it really comfortable and easy to maneuver. For weekend trips by car, I will typically use a duffel bag, but since this trip is gonna involve train stations, taxis, and subways, the wheeled carry-on makes a lot more sense. Now, two of the biggest challenges when packing any type of bag are keeping things organized and having enough space. And one of the easiest ways I've found to solve both of those problems is by using packing cubes. I absolutely love these things. Everything is organized and contained. Things aren't getting mixed together or coming out the side of the suitcase when I'm trying to close it. For a short trip like this, I will use one of these in place of my regular Dopp kit just to save some space. But my favorite part about these is that they are compressible, which really helps you maximize the space in your suitcase. your suitcase. Now when I travel I like to read but the problem with bringing a book is not only is it heavy but it takes up a lot of space. That's why one of my basic travel essentials is a subscription to Audible today's video sponsor. In addition to lightening my suitcase and giving me more space what I love about Audible is the incredible selection of audiobooks. Literally hundreds of thousands of titles that they have across every genre. Right now I'm in the middle of spare by Prince Harry, which I highly recommend checking out. It's very interesting and inspiring as an audible member You're able to choose one title a month to keep from the entire catalog And that includes the latest bestsellers and new releases members also get full access to a growing selection of included audiobooks audible originals as well as thousands of podcasts and you can download and stream all all include titles as much as you want. Let Audible help you discover new ways to laugh, be inspired or be entertained. New members can try it free for 30 days. All you gotta do is visit audible.com slash he spoke style or text he spoke style all one word to 500-500 to try Audible free for 30 days. Up next, a couple small things. First, gotta have some headphones to listen to those audiobooks, podcasts, music. And I always take a power bank or two with me to keep my phone topped up throughout the day. Nothing worse than running out of battery. Now, anytime you are stuffing clothing in a suitcase, it's gonna get wrinkled. There's no way around it. And that's why I always travel with a steamer. I never rely on my hotel to have one. And if you've ever tried to use an iron as a steamer, you know, it doesn't really work that well. So that's why I always make room to pack my own. Another clothing maintenance tool that I always travel with is a clothing brush. helps me keep everything lint and pet hair free, as well as looking clean and new. And finally, we have a watch roll. You guys know me, I like to have options for the wrist and for the variety of things we're gonna be doing from casual to formal, I'm definitely gonna need more than just one watch. All right, so those are the basics. Now I'm gonna quickly run down my entire packing list to include all the clothing, shoes and accessories I'll be bringing with me. I'm only gonna bring one coat with me, So it needs to be warm, it needs to be versatile. So I'm going with a classic camel overcoat. Next, brown plaid sport coat and gray chalk stripe flannel suit for my tailored items. Because it's winter, I'm going heavy on cashmere sweaters. I've got a black turtleneck, a cream turtleneck, and a navy v-neck. Two shirts, a light blue button up and a denim button down. Three pairs of pants, mid-gray flannel, blue jeans, and black jeans. Since space is at a premium, I'm going with only two pairs of shoes, formal and casual. We've got brown oxfords and white leather sneakers. Onto accessories, a tan knit hat, a big brown scarf, a brown silk patterned tie, white silk pocket square, two white t-shirts, two pairs of underwear, two pairs of gray socks, one pair of blue socks. And for watches, we're going with a watch number one on a mesh strap, watch number two on a brown leather strap and a watch number three. So that kind of seems like a lot, but it really is the minimum that I need for the range of things that we'll be doing. And it also ensures that I'm not gonna be wearing the same outfit more than once. I'll show you how I'm gonna pack everything in just a bit. Trust me, it is going to fit. But before I do that, let me give you a rundown of each individual outfit that I'm going to be wearing. So the first look here is the outfit I'll be traveling in from Baltimore up to New York. We've got the camel coat, black turtleneck, paired with some medium blue jeans, big brown scarf, tan knit cap, white sneakers, and the watch. It's casual, but a nice mix of sporty and tailored with the overcoat and the sneakers. But the most important thing is that it's comfortable, which is exactly what you want when you're traveling. Look number two is for our evening out together after we get in. You can see that I've repurposed the black turtleneck that I wore on the way up and paired it with a brown Glen plaid flannel sport coat and some mid-grey flannel pants. Anchoring this look are the brown Oxfords. And on my wrist, we have a beautiful watch. Didn't want to be too fancy, but definitely wanted to be elegant and refined. So a turtleneck with a sport coat is a great way to do that. And of course, camel overcoat pairs effortlessly with this look. So for running around the city the next day, doing a little shopping, we're going with a slight variation of the first travel look. Once again, the camel coat, which I'm pairing with the cream colored cashmere turtleneck, black jeans, white sneakers, big brown scarf, tan knit hat, and the watch. I feel like this look is very New York. It's cool, it's a little edgy. It also feels very simple and effortless to me. So really the perfect look for a morning and possibly afternoon running around the city. I am a firm believer that you really make your own occasions to wear the things that you want to wear. And fancy dinner with friends in New York City is the perfect opportunity to put on my gray double-breasted chalk stripe flannel suit. I'm wearing it with a light blue button-up shirt, which I paired with a brown silk pattern tie to tie in, seriously, no pun intended, with the dark brown Oxford shoes. Dash of elegance in the breast pocket with the silk pocket square, and as well as on the wrist. Throw on the camel overcoat and I am ready to head to the restaurant for a tasty cocktail, delicious dinner, and great company. Look number five needs to pull double duty because we're having a casual brunch before we head to the train station to travel back home. So I'm going with a navy v-neck layered over a denim button down and paired with some medium blue jeans white sneakers big brown scarf and the watch on the wrist nothing fancy at all just casual and comfortable Great for an easy brunch and the two and a half hour train ride back home All right So you've seen my essentials my entire packing list what each outfit looks like now it's time to pack it all up All right So first thing I'm gonna pack up are my tailored items beginning with my pants now the way I fold my pants when I pack them is to just fold them in half once and then one more time so they're folded into quarters. Next the jackets. Now the trick to folding a sport coat or a suit jacket so it packs well is to basically turn one of the shoulders inside out and you nest the other shoulder inside of that make sure everything's lined up and then fold the jacket in half. Now once again shoulder goes inside out other shoulder nested inside that everything's lined up and and fold it in half. These items go into the large packing cube and I'm not gonna compress it just to keep them as wrinkle free as possible. Shirts next. Now the first thing I do is to button up most of the front of the shirt, turn it over, fold one sleeve over and then bring the cuff up to the collar. Same thing with the other sleeve. Then I will fold the shirt over into thirds and into thirds one more time and that's how I fold the shirt. So one more time here, button up the front, Flip it over, fold each sleeve over, and bring the cuff up to the collar, into thirds lengthwise, and then into thirds one more time. Next, I'm doing the sweaters, nothing fancy here, just folding the sleeves under, and then folding the sweater in half once more. Then in this cube, I'm also gonna put my jeans and two white t-shirts. All that goes into the cube, zip it up, and compress to save some space. Socks and underwear into the small cube zipped up and compressed. For my tie I do have a travel case that I like to use. I'll fold the tie in half twice, put it into the case, buckle it in and zip it up. Toiletries next as I mentioned using another cube instead of my regular Dopp kit to save space in my bag. Now the fun part of packing everything into the carry-on. On the left side that's where the large packing cube with my tailored items goes. I'm also going to put one shoe on the side as well as the watch roll. On the right side, first the medium packing cube up there, then I'm going to lay the tie case to the left of that. Toiletries next, followed by a second shoe. Clothing brush goes here, travel steamer goes here, and the cube with the socks and underwear goes here. Cinch that down, throw the power bank in right here and the pocket square over here. Then all I got to do is close it up, zip it up, and I am ready to go. And voila, there you have it. I'm packed up. I'm ready to go. I actually really need to get out of here to make it to the train. But before I do, I've got two things for you real quick. First, of course, I want to thank Audible for sponsoring this video. A reminder to go to audible.com slash he spoke style or text.

        "transcript": " Three pieces of outerwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one pair of sneakers, and a black hat. That's all you need for a minimalist winter capsule wardrobe. I'll show you each piece and nine different ways to style them right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa. This is Heath Spokes Style. advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. So let me answer the biggest question you might have, which is, why would you want to have a minimalist wardrobe? Because isn't one of the best things about style, all of the options and variety that you have to choose from? I had the exact same question 11 years ago, and it was right after I read the Steve Jobs biography. Steve Jobs, as you probably know, was famous for wearing the same thing every single day. Isimiyaki Turtle Neck, Levi's 501s, and New Balance 992s. This was his uniform, and one of the reasons he said he liked wearing the same thing every day was because it completely eliminated having to decide what to wear every day. And that freed up his mind to focus on other things, like building one of the biggest brands in the world. That idea of having one less thing to think about every day was very interesting to me, and I was really attracted to the idea of simplifying. What more could I accomplish or what new things might I accomplish if I remove that daily style decision for my life? I really wanted to know and I decided to try it out for myself so I made the year 2012 the year of wearing one thing. So this experiment was actually the thing that kind of made me start. He spoke style and one of the very first posts I did on the website back in 2013 was all about the journey I took wearing one thing. So there were obviously some challenges, little tweaks I needed to make here and there. I don't want to get too deep into that right now, but if you're interested in reading that post, I'll link to it right up there so you can check it out. But one of the biggest takeaways for me having gone through that is that I really learned that you don't need a whole lot of options. And if you've got the right pieces, they're versatile, they all work together, and you've chosen them with intention, you really do learn to do more with less. And yes, that's freeing mentally, financially, and simplifying in that way can really help you dial in and solidify a very strong sense of personal style. And that ethos of doing more with less, of having a wardrobe full of versatile quality pieces is exactly what the luxury menswear brand Lestrange London is all about and it's why I'm proud to partner with them once again for this video. Their entire collection, in addition to being incredibly versatile, is focused on quality and only uses renewable and recycled materials so they're able to reduce their impact on the environment which is another benefit of having a lean and minimal wardrobe. The fit as you'll see shortly is outstanding and if you want to check out any of the pieces I'll be featuring in this video I'll have links down below in the description. Okay so the first piece we have here is the Lestrange London modular wool coat. It is made from 100% recycled Melton wool that is GRS certified. It's a very dense weave that feels really nice in the hand. It's definitely going to keep you warm and protected from the wind. Styling wise, we've got two outer pockets, two inner pockets, and the one on the left is a zip closure, so great for a wallet. Inside also is a clip-on snap, so if you wanted to layer in one of their other pieces like a vest, it's very easy to do. It has a single vent in the back and a zip up front with snap closures, which when you do them up, makes for a very sleek, minimal appearance. I went with a size medium here just so I could have a little more room for layering, a little more comfort. If I wanted something more fitted, I definitely would have gone with a size small. Up next we have the Lestrange London Hydro-Wool Bomber. Now this is made from a very tightly spun wool and engineered with a bonded waterproof membrane. So not only do you have a windproof fabric, but it's one that is waterproof as well while still being comfortable and breathable. outer pockets fully lined on the inside with two inner pockets. It's got knit ribbed cuffs, same on the collar, as well as the bottom finishing and a zip up closure. Our third piece of outerwear is the Lestrange London Modular Vest. It's got a zip up front, two outside pockets, one inner pocket. It's made with 100% recycled polyester. It's extremely lightweight, but it will keep you warm. And it's not very bulky, which is what you want because in addition to being a great standalone piece of outerwear. It also works great as a layering piece. You may remember from a previous video that I had the navy version of this. Had that in the medium which I thought was just slightly too large so I went for a small this time and I think it fits much better. Up next we have a pair of black wool trousers. These are the Lestrange London 24 wool trousers and these were actually a huge surprise to me. I'm very picky about how my pants fit and I've pretty much given up at this point on off the rack options for trousers like this but these have completely exceeded my expectations. Before I show you the fit though let's talk details they're made from a 100% merino wool flannel. It does have just a little bit of stretch so super comfortable. It has a hidden elastic waistband, inner cord fastening, both a hook and eye closure, and snap that is hidden. Single pocket on the back with a snap closure and two side pockets. Fit. So I was worried that these were gonna be way too slim. The leg opening is around 14 inches, but as you can see, they're cut really well. They're not too slim, they're not too baggy, they're easy to move around in, they're very comfortable. And I think they're pretty smart and versatile. Work date, just hanging out at home, they're perfect for that. Our second pair of trousers is this cream cotton pair. Pretty standard, two front pockets, two back pockets, hook and eye closure, belt loops, and I do have these styled with a two inch cuff. I think it's a little more of a smarter look and nice balance with the plain bottom black trousers. Next, we have a cashmere hoodie. I mean, what can you say about this? It's a hoodie, it's cashmere, super soft, very comfortable, and I think having a casual staple like a hoodie in a luxury fabric is an easy upgrade to make your casual outfits more elegant and chic. Another cashmere sweater here with this cream colored turtleneck. You know, in addition to being practical terms of warmth, a turtleneck is also timeless and sophisticated, especially when you're pairing it with other pieces that might tend to be a little sportier. It's a great and very interesting juxtaposition that just works. I'm only choosing one pair of shoes and of course going with the minimal white leather sneaker. I've designed this entire capsule wardrobe to have a very cool and chic vibe that walks the line between casual and sophisticated and really no No other pair of shoes does that better than the classic minimal white sneaker. Finally, we have a simple black baseball cap. This is from Strange London. It's made with a heavyweight organic cotton twill. It's got the adjustable strap in the back, very subtle minimal branding. I have trouble finding hats that fit my head well, especially baseball hats, but this one fits great. It's very comfortable and it's the perfect finishing touch for the vibe of all of the outfits. And speaking of the outfits, now that we've got all the pieces, let's jump in and check out 9 ways to style them. But quick word before we get to the outfits and something to really pay attention to here. So we're dealing with a really finite amount of things. Two pairs of pants, two tops, three pieces of outerwear, one pair of shoes, one accessory, and an extremely limited neutral color palette of dark and light. Now with all these constraints, especially only having four foundational items, you might I think that it would be difficult to create variety and to really have each outfit look different. But as you'll see, it's possible. And honestly, what makes it possible, especially during the winter, is to have a few key pieces of outerwear. This will completely change the look and feel of your outfit, but enough talk. Let me show you what I'm talking about. First look, starting off with the hoodie, paired with the cream pants, white sneakers, black cap. And just so you know, because I'm gonna be wearing the sneakers and the hat and every look, I'm not gonna keep mentioning that. So to finish this look off, I'm going with the vest. This combination is very sporty, but it also has an elevated feel to it because of the cashmere hoodie, as well as the color of the pants. Next, sticking with the same foundation, but instead of the vest, I'm going with the HydraWol bomber. And here you can start to see exactly what I was talking about in the setup. It's the same exact foundation as the previous outfit, but somehow it looks completely different. And you can change the whole vibe even more by adding a cool pair of black sunglasses. And to finish this first trio off, I'm swapping the bomber for the wool coat. Here we've got a completely different silhouette, different feel, obviously different level of warmth, and a pretty cool juxtaposition of casual, sporty, and slightly dressy. Now, if you look at each of these outfits side by side, you can really see how different and distinct they are simply because of the outerwear and the vibe that each piece gives off. Next, I'm sticking with a hoodie, but swapping out the cream pants for the black pair. And then we're gonna go with the vest to finish it off. Again, compared to the version with the cream pants, look one, we have a completely different feel here because there's a lot more black in this outfit. It's edgier, a little more serious, but still sporty. And instead of the black pieces being the accent, we're letting the light colored hoodie and the sneakers provide the contrast. Look five, you guessed it, just swapping the vest for the bomber. With the jacket zipped up, the look is very clean. almost monolithic, except for the two pops of contrast with the hood and the sneakers. Moving on from the hoodie at this point and swapping it out for the cream turtleneck and pairing it with the black pants and the vest. Now I'm gonna tuck in the turtleneck here. I think it looks clean and sharp. And I think it goes better with the general feelless outfit, which I would describe as chic, sporty, and sophisticated, perfect for running around during the day. And then to transition that look to something more for the evening, or if it happens to be colder out, going to swap the vest for the overcoat. I think combining dressier pieces in a more sporty or casual context is a great way to experiment. And this look in particular is one that I really like. For the first of the final two looks, taking look six and swapping the black pants for the cream pair. So instead of an edgier look, we've got something a little bit fresher, sort of an opera ski vibe, but definitely more of an outfit for the daytime. And then we're taking the same foundation and changing the vest for the overcoat. And not to keep saying the same thing, but with just one small change, as you can see, you can completely transform how an outfit looks. So what's really interesting about a capsule wardrobe is that although it is very simple, it does take some thought and effort to put one together. You gotta be sure that you've got really versatile pieces that work together, and that's really the trick. So I've actually done a lot of this work for you and put together that playlist right over there, which is designed to help you build and apply the capsule wardrobe concept in a variety of ways. Whether you are a beginner looking to start from scratch, if you're looking for a versatile business casual wardrobe or a seasonal wardrobe, click on that playlist to see exactly how it's done."

        "transcript": " So if one thing is true, it's that we all make mistakes. But when it comes to bespoke or custom clothing, that is a time you do not want to make a mistake. You're laying out all that cash, so you want to get it right. So today I'm here in New York City at the Michael Andrews Bespoke Studio with my friend Corey Sylvester, who is Chief Operating Officer and Partner here at Michael Andrews. And he's got over 10 years working in bespoke clothing, so he's gonna share his 10 biggest mistakes that he's seen guys make. Corey, thanks so much for being here. It's my pleasure. So before we get started, as we are want to do whenever I come here, we're going to have a little bit of a drink, right? So I brought a very special tequila. This is by Jose Cuervo. It's their Reserva de la Familia. And actually, we're very thankful for Jose Cuervo for sponsoring this video. Now I thought this would be a great tequila to share because I think it matches up really well with the topic of bespoke clothing. focused on craftsmanship and heritage here. So one thing that's interesting, Reserva de la Familia, completely family owned. It's the oldest distillery in Latin America, La Rojena. It's actually in Tequila, Mexico. And every year the Cuervo family will hand select the liquid for this particular tequila using a process that's been passed down for 10 generations. What do you say we open the bottle? Great, sounds really special. All right. Oh, nice. Oh, wow. That's a pretty great looking bottle. Yeah, I see so. Extra in Yeho. One thing about this bottle. So all of the bottles for this tequila are hand blown. Again, I think it ties in really well to the idea of the Spoke tailoring, custom clothing. Each bottle is hand numbered and signed. We've got the wax seal here with the Cuervo family crest. And every single one of these bottles is hand labeled. That's the bottle. How about we open it up? Give it a taste? Yes. Don't threaten me with a good time. Ha ha ha. Sounds good. All right, glass. Please. Smells great. It's a very rich bouquet. I would say I give it a taste. It sounds good. Cheers. Cheers my friends. Salute. Tastes even better. Very smooth, very complex taste. It's actually aged in new American oak and French oak barrels, so with different levels of char, so that's what gives it the complexity. You know, it's interesting when you think of tequila, you don't always think of. something as being smooth, you think shots and you know. This is not that. This is not that. This is really, really, really delicious. It's delicious. Well, we could finish this glass or we could start talking about the 10 mistakes that people make. Let's do both. Let's do both. Onto our top 10 mistakes that you've seen people make in an over 10 year career working in custom tailored clothing. And the first one is one that I talk about all the time on the channel and that is not having a plan. Totally. Yeah, oftentimes guys come in, we have over 50,000 fabrics, right? So that can be overwhelming. So it's really beneficial to have some direction, some kind of idea. And if you don't have any clue, that's okay too, but it's more than likely that you're gonna wanna come consult with us. I often send guys home with homework, say, hey, go home, mood board, Pinterest is really great, invariably, inevitably they come back with a bunch of images of you. Often times, as would be the case. And yeah, it really helps to have some direction. See, I can totally relate to that. Like having too many options, being a Libra is a terrible thing for me. So yeah, making a plan before you come in, definitely a good thing. So what are some things other than Pinterest you might recommend for someone to come in to have that plan and ready to go to know what they want? It can be really helpful to find, I don't know if avatar is the right word, but like a style icon, like, you know, for me, I really admire the style of like Tom Ford, Ralph Lauren, Serge Gainsburg. So I'll often see images of them. I might save that and say, hey, you know, that's a cool look. At the same time, it's really important to make sure that you're choosing clothes that flatter you and not somebody else. And that leads us into mistake number two, which is not playing to your strengths. Correct. Yeah, so all too often guys will come in and say, hey, I saw Ryan Gosling or Ryan Reynolds in this suit, they looked really cool and you're like, well, you do not have the same features or characteristics or six pack as those guys. So there are some other things that may be more flattering for you, given your hair color, eye color, the color of your skin or your physical features. Like so I pick up the latest issue of Esquire and I see the rock and I come to you and I say, hey Corey, I love how the rock looks in the suit. Can I get that suit too? You look like that. And you know, full disclosure, we may not be able to make you look exactly like the rock. You probably need about 20 more years in the gym and a lot more protein than we have behind the bar. No offense, you look great. But that's, you know, there are things to be more flattering for you, just like there would be more flattering things like for me, like today I'm wearing a high contrast outfit of black and white because I have kind of high contrast features, you more medium contrast, so the two shades of blue look you know smashing on you, so you know your outfit looks distinctly better on you than it would on me and vice versa, because we're both dressed to our strengths. So how do you get the guy who comes in and say I want this but you know it's not right for him to get to the point where they're you know okay with what you suggest? Well, I think the good news is that for us, most people come to us for our expertise and most guys are looking for guidance and that's how we think of ourselves. We're not fashion designers. It's not our job to tell you what to wear or dictate any one look. We're trying to help guide you through a process to understand what you want from the experience and help you to understand maybe what you want from it as well. So, mistake number three now has to do with time management and procrastinating is a big mistake you've seen people make. Procrastination is a huge mistake. You know guys, some guys, let's not say all of us, are shopping is not their favorite thing to do and a lot of guys will put off getting things done that they may need. But what happens is the longer you take the more limited your options may become. Also the more expensive it may become to produce the thing that you want. There may be expedited service charges that are involved so it's really good to be ahead of especially with custom tailoring ahead of any event dates or things that you have. I would say the biggest reason that guys wait is they're planning on losing weight which is totally fair if you're going to lose 20 or 30 pounds ahead of your big day you should wait a little while but there's also plenty of guys who put that off too long so my advice would be if you're planning to lose some weight set you save yourself a goal and a goal date in between say a month from today. If you're planning to lose X amount of pounds check in a month from then if you're on target that's great. Plan your next appointment accordingly. If you get to that date and you've not lost any weight you should probably go ahead and make an appointment because you don't want to wait until it's too late. Right. So for mistake number four it's one that I think honestly I think a lot of us make early on and that is going too far with the custom details. And I can totally understand why, right? You know, you're getting something custom, you're spending the money, you want it to be special, but you can go too far with those types of details. Totally. With custom tailoring and bespoke tailoring, especially, everything is within your control. So you can change every aspect of the suit, but just because you can do it doesn't necessarily mean you should do it. Right. Which is where we can be really helpful in guiding you to what details you might want to personalize, like the inside of your lining or maybe a special insignia under the collar felt or details that you haven't even thought of before. But for the most part, if there's not something you know you want to change in the style or design of a suit, it's generally good guidance not to start now. I can assure you we've already obsessed over all the details of our suits. So if it's not something you thought about before, you probably don't want to start to change it during a consultation. So can you give me an example of... you have to name names here. Can you give me an example of one of the worst, like overly customized things. Sure. I think the first thing that comes to mind is I made this beautiful sand linen suit for a guy who's going to a friend's wedding and he had started this furniture design company and he really liked the colors red and yellow. They're kind of part of his logo and insignia. So he wanted to incorporate them into the suit. There's many ways that we can do that. He thought it would be fun to have rotating red and yellow stitches throughout the entire garment. which I thought might have been a choice that he would eventually regret. So I shared with him all the different ways that we can incorporate the colors. And he asked for my personal opinion if I thought that it would be sick to have the red and yellow stitching. And I explained to him that I thought it would be really nice choice for Ronald McDonald, but perhaps not for him. And he agreed, he ended up doing all red, and then a little bit of yellow in the lining, which is still a really bold statement, but one that he did not regret. And so I think that's a good example of us kind of getting to where we wanted to go. Everything in moderation. All things in moderation. Dressing and drinking. Okay, so mistake number five is kind of an art versus science thing. And that's that, do not expect perfection. Yeah. There's no perfection in bespoke tailoring, but in tailoring bespoke is the closest thing you can get to perfection. I think I've had the good fortune of meeting a lot of really admirable tailors in our trade who've been doing this a lot longer than I have, and the best of them will be the first to tell you that there are still students of their craft learning every day and always striving for perfection that they themselves know they'll never attain. I think there's a part of the person who's getting into custom or bespoke that they're also like, I'm paying this much, so it better be perfect. And oftentimes you can get there, but that's not what happens immediately. Yeah, I think also the more choices that you can make and the more control you have over something, the higher the expectation becomes, so it's very important to stay grounded in those decisions to have a realistic expectation, like, look, in the end, we're making really beautiful clothing, but we're not saving lives. So this suit is gonna make you look and feel your best, but chances are, you know, it's not gonna change your life. It's not the reason your wife's marrying you, hopefully. It's not the reason you got the promotion, but you know, it plays a role and it's a part of it, but it should be kept in proportion. in perspective. Now you're talking a little bit about weddings and I think that leads nicely into mistake number six which you identified which is people listening to the peanut gallery. Could you explain what that means? Sure. So it's totally understandable you're coming in for your big day and your fiance should probably have a say in that most fiance's do and sometimes your Your mother-in-law may also want to have a say, and your mother, and the cousin. So the peanut gallery, so to speak, can grow. And that's great. It's really nice to come in and have that experience with your friends or family or groomsmen. But it's important to remember that when you're sitting with us, we're dedicated professionals who this is our career. Our job is to guide you into looking and feeling your best. are things that you're the delicate way of putting this. Well, okay, so like they have ideas. Maybe you don't have an idea or maybe you do. So how do you... What's the psychology behind like swaying, you know, staying in that middle lane there? Sure. Well, my advice to grooms is if your fiance really feels strongly something about it and you're indifferent definitely go with her idea. But sometimes there can be too many chefs and I think in the end deferring to the professional expertise of your bespoke clothing can really be helpful. You know remember if your friends and family were dedicated professional clothes you'd probably be shopping with them anyways so maybe a good rule to keep in mind. So mistake number seven I think really applies to the person who is getting into custom clothing for the first time. And that is what you call overordering. You don't want to do that. What is it and why? Why not? So somebody may have lost a bunch of weight or started a new job, made a career change, or decided that now is really the time that they need to elevate their game. And they're going to come to us and they're going to do a complete wardrobe overhaul. And that's great. We're here for that. You just want to make sure that you give yourself and your tailor enough time to really get things right for you and right the way that you want. If you've had extensive bespoke tailoring or custom tailoring experience, that's great because you probably have a really good idea of where you want to start or what you want to achieve. But if you don't, then so much of this is experiential. I've been doing this for 10 years and I feel like I've only just settled into knowing exactly my preferences for different things. I will also say, if you have extensive experience already and you're coming to us, there's likely a reason you're not using your previous tailor. So we wanna make sure that we have the time to really understand what it is you want from the experience and help you to achieve that. It's also a time thing too, right? So say I come, I'm gonna get 10 new suits, but it's the first time I've ever come to you. I don't know how it's gonna fit. Like it's gonna take time to dial in my pattern, right? So you don't wanna do 10 suits and have the pattern off. like let's do one, get it right, really dial it in and then we can order more. Yeah, once you've gone through the process initially and your pattern's on file, it really becomes enjoyable, as you know, because you just call your tailor or you come in, pour an ice glass of tequila and you don't have to be re-measured, you don't have to be refit, we have your pattern on file and you understand what you want and we're hopefully not just meeting but exceeding your expectations each time thereafter. Okay, from overordering, we're going to mistake number eight, which is overspending. Yeah, just as somebody could overspend, you could also kind of underinvest. You know, we offer custom tailoring in three distinct tiers. We have made to measure semi bespoke and full bespoke. And for what each of those are, I believe they're an incomparable value relative to what else is available. But they are different and there are different benefits and reasons that the prices might be different. So just like somebody who comes in, who's never done custom before, and they're really comfortable with $1,000 made to measure suit, if they were to come in and buy a $3,000 bespoke suit, I really wouldn't want that because chances are they're overextending themselves. It's gonna set an expectation that we really can't exceed. Just conversely, if somebody has been buying bespoke suits on Salvatoreau and they come in here and they decide to go for a made to measure suit, it's highly likely that we're not gonna be able to meet their expectation because they're gonna demand higher than we're able to give in that role. So it's really good, just like we said originally, to have some kind of sense of direction. I think it's great to have a budget, and I think it's great to stick to that budget. And if you need to have a different budget for your expectations, we can help you to understand that as well. Mistake number nine, I think is a little tongue in cheek here, but you say don't dress on an empty stomach. No. Or come to a custom tailor appointment on an empty stomach. Well, as you know, we have a bar and... But we never overindulge. No, no, but we do like to enjoy ourselves through our fittings. And so the average appointment for a new client is anywhere from 90 minutes to two hours. Sometimes they take a little bit longer. And so, you know, if you're gonna partake, it could be good to kind of plan accordingly. Make sure you don't skip lunch that day. Yeah. Got it. I've had to put a client more than one in a cab on occasion, don't be that guy. Okay. Which brings us to our final mistake and it's the biggest one that Corey says he has seen in over 10-year career in custom clothing and that is people asking for advice and then not listening to you. Yeah, all too often I would say that is the most common mistake and it kind of underlies many of the previous mistakes that we talked about it. You know, we like to think about the service we offer as a professional service like, you know, you go to your lawyer for legal advice, you go to your accountant for financial advisor, your financial planner. I wouldn't go to my doctor and ask for a diagnosis and then tell him what it is. So I would say it's kind of the same thing with us. We always have your best interest in mind. We want you to look and feel your best and so you can trust that when we're suggesting something to you that a lot of thought and care has gone in to why we're telling you that. That's great. And it's, I mean, that's sort of where I'm at, you know, again, I'm a Libra. It's tough for me to make decisions but having worked with you guys for pretty much like close to a decade now, like you know what I like, we have this relationship, I trust you. It's all about trust. So like, I don't wanna make decisions about certain things, you know? Like I know that you will make a better decision than I could ever make about something. So like, you know, when I put some things together, I say, you pick the buttons, you pick the lining, and it's always perfect. That's actually, thank you for saying that. That's actually a great example. When someone entrusts you like that, That's where we're really, you know, you're like, wow, now it's on, I have to really make sure I nail this because you feel that level of trust and to hear you say that means a lot, so thank you. Yeah, well it means a lot that the service that I've received from you guys over the years and as a small token of my appreciation, I do have something for you. Where did it go? Oh, here it is. I found it. So I know we just cracked cracked open this bottle, but I do have another bottle here for you Keep this at the studio here serve it to all the best clients or just keep it for me when I come by No sharing is caring. That's right. That's right. It's always better to share and we appreciate very much Jose Cuervo for sponsoring this video. Corey, thank you so much for sharing my pleasure your knowledge and expertise And thanks for watching everyone."

        "transcript": " It's hard to describe, but there's something about a leather jacket that just makes you feel different. And I'm not talking about the, oh, you feel like a badass when you wear one kind of thing, because that kind of style isn't for everyone. A leather jacket can elevate your look. It can be elegant. It can be sophisticated. And it will transform how you feel when you wear one. If you've been looking for a leather jacket to upgrade your style in that way, I've got five options that I think really fit the bill, along with five different outfits for some fall winter inspiration. I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. Today's video is sponsored by the Jacket Maker and all the leather jackets I'll be featuring are from the Jacket Maker.

Now, let's take a look at five leather jackets to upgrade your fall and winter style. Up first, one of my all time favorites, we have a classic G1 bomber jacket. The G1, which is what this military flight jacket came to be known as, is a revised version of the 1930s US Navy jacket known as the M422 Alpha. It was updated in 1947 and is still the current issue jacket for commissioned and enlisted aviation personnel on flying status in the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. This version is made with a great looking dark brown sheave skin leather, two outer pockets with button closures, quilted lining to inner pockets. It's got a knit rib cuff and knit rib around the bottom as well. Zip up front and a fur collar that is removable. Obviously, many, many ways to wear this, but let's take a look at how I styled it for this video. So very classic, not unexpected. I've got a mock neck sweater that I paired with some medium blue jeans, suede chukkas, and then giving a nod to the G1's history with both the vintage aviators and the IWC Spitfire on the wrist. When I wear a leather jacket, I generally like it to be the focal point of the outfit, but I tried to make this a little more interesting with the addition of some texture. The mock neck sweater has a great texture to it, which really sets it apart from the smooth leather. And then the suede chukkas as well, you know, unlike matching your belt finish to your shoes totally fine to wear suede shoes with a smooth leather jacket. It breaks it up visually, it makes it look less perfect and I think it's overall a more interesting look. Up next we have another bomber jacket, this one a bit more simple than the previous, still a very classic look made with black sheepskin leather. It's very soft and supple, two outer pockets, quilted inner lining, two inner pockets. It's got knit rib cuffs and same on the bottom as well. A zip up front and then the collar is actually lined on the inside. So if you wanted to zip it up all the way, it would be a bit more comfortable around the neck. So this look is perhaps a little unexpected. Wanted to show that it is possible to dress up a black leather jacket. Again, it's just very simple cashmere cable knit sweater paired with some mid-gray flannel pants. I went with some black oxfords Rolex DHS on the wrist and then a pair of chunky black eyeglasses. I always think it smartens up and evening look like this. Dressing monochromatically like this, easy way to make a statement by doing less and also a statement that's not going to call a ton of attention to yourself. To do it well, just make sure you're not matching colors exactly. I've got two shades of gray here along with the black and then adding in some texture as I've done with the cable knit is Another great way to keep it interesting Here we have another bomber jacket in a beautiful mocha brown suede It's a goat skin leather and you can see the really nice suede finish This is a really simple and elegant design which I love. It's got two outer pockets quilted inner lining with two inner pockets. The collar is a knit rib which gives it a little more of a sporty feel. It's got a zip-up closure and snap closures on the cuffs. Going monochromatic once again with this look, got a tan cashmere turtleneck paired with some cream colored cotton trousers, brown suede belt to go with the suede penny loafers, also cream colored socks, and finished off with the Vacheron traditionnelle on my wrist. Pretty much exactly the same concept as the previous look where we're dealing with a variety of shades of brown as well as some texture. Great example of how a leather jacket, in this case suede, can be more sophisticated than you might think. Here is our fourth jacket. This one is in a beautiful cognac light brown color. Once again it's made with sheepskin leather, two outer pockets, a quilted viscose lining to inner pockets. It's got a button up front which gives it a much different look and feel than a zip up front, cuffs are buttoned as well, and it's got a simple well proportioned collar. Styling it here with a little more contrast. I've got a cream crew neck sweater paired with some black jeans, brown Chelsea boots, and a speedy on the wrist. Here I have decided to kind of color match the boots and the jacket. You know with a higher contrast foundation of cream and black, it really helps balance the look as a whole. I really do love the color of this jacket. Just pops and as I said, the button up front just makes it different than most leather jackets and as a result, a real standout piece. So if you have been a long time fan of HSS, I think you're really going to be excited about this last jacket. It is very similar to one that I have worn a lot in videos over the years and pretty much anytime I wear this jacket you guys ask me where you can get it and I always feel bad because it's really old and no longer available. But this one is the closest thing I have ever found to that jacket and not only is it very similar but the price is way better than the other jacket. So this is a light brown suede trucker jacket. It's goat skin leather. It's just super soft and supple. It feels great in the hand. It's got four outer pockets, two down low and two breast pockets with snap closures. Inside is a quilted lining as well as two inner pockets. It's a snap closure up the front. Simple collar and it's also got snap closures on the cuffs as well as on the two waist adjustment straps. Going super casual with this look, a cashmere hoodie paired with some light wash jeans, white leather sneakers, and speedy on the wrist once again. You've probably noticed that I like to pair a cashmere with leather jackets. I think especially as an older guy, it's a very easy way to showcase a little more sophistication and make the look more grown up. Also, you know, investing in pieces like that, you're going to get more out of them. So over time, financially, it makes sense as well.

        "transcript": " Do you know what is legitimately crazy? What's crazy is that it only takes seven seconds for someone to make a judgment about you. So if this is the first time you've ever seen one of my videos, chances are that in the time it took me to say those first two sentences, you've already formed an impression of me. It's kinda not fair, right? That we don't have more than seven seconds to come across as who we really are. Now I said that's crazy, but what's even crazier is that there's some research that suggests that you're gonna be judged in one tenth of a second. One tenth of a second. And those are for big things like trustworthiness, honesty, which means that the first impression you make on someone is extremely important. It goes without saying, and we all know the same. Whether it is a job interview, first day at work, a first date, you do not want to mess this up because not only do you never get that chance again, but if you come off the wrong way, it can be very hard to change people's opinions of you in the future. So how do you do it? How do you make a great first impression? Well, keep watching because I'm going to share 10 of the best tips I've ever found to help you make a great first impression. I'm Brian Sakawa. This is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. Sorry, hold on a second. I just need to reply to this text real quick. Okay, so, hold on, sorry, sorry, I just, I just really need to... So that scenario is one that we are all too familiar with these days. And being on your phone when you meet someone for the first time, or even just having it in your hand, will make a terrible impression. It tells someone that you aren't paying attention and it also communicates that you aren't interested in them. So tip number one for making a great first impression is to put the phone down. And actually, you'd be better off just completely putting it away. And make sure you turn off the ringer. This next one is one of my all-time biggest pet peeves. In fact, it's probably the biggest pet peeve I have. It's something that my mother was always insistent about. It's something that if you're in the military, could get you in a lot of trouble. If you are meeting someone for the first time, make sure you get there on time. Do not be late. Meeting late is the ultimate sign of disrespect. So especially for a first meeting, make sure you're planning ahead. You know how long it's going to take you to get there. And follow probably the best advice I've ever gotten, which is on time is late and early is on time. And if your first meeting happens to be virtual, which happens a lot these days, make sure you've checked your connection and downloaded any software updates you need well before you need to hop on that call. So remember again that right or wrong, people are going to make a judgment about you within the first seven seconds of meeting you for the first time. So what you say is definitely important, but those nonverbal things are even more important. The first one and possibly the most important one to keep in mind is eye contact. Eye contact is often taken as a show of honesty and as a way of showing respect to the person you're talking to. And try to initiate that eye contact before you start talking. And then while you're talking, maintain that regular eye contact to show the other person that you're paying attention to them and listening to what they're saying. Now just be careful that you don't confuse making good eye contact with staring someone down. There's a big difference there. So this next one could be considered superficial. It's not fair that someone is going to judge you in seven seconds. But one of the keys to making a great first impression is to understand that your appearance matters. In fact, two researchers from the National Research Council of Canada found that, quote, people are affected by your appearance whether or not they realize it and whether or not they think appearance is important. So basically what that means is what you wear and how you look has significant consequences. In terms of clothing, you always want to dress appropriately for the situation. If you're going to a job interview and you're underdressed, that's going to send a signal that you're not serious about the job. If you're overdressed for a casual meeting, that's going to send a different kind of signal and maybe not the one you intend. In terms of physical appearance, the first thing someone sees is your face and taking good care of your skin is an easy way to help you impress in that area. When I look for skincare products, what I look for is simple, easy to use, and no nonsense. And that's why my favorite skincare products are from Teege Hanley, who I'm proud to partner with for today's video because they check every single one of those boxes. Now all you really need is Teege's basic plan. That's a face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, and AM moisturizer that has SPF. You need that to protect your skin from the sun. And a PM moisturizer that helps with the important repair process that goes on while you sleep. If you're an older guy like me, I would definitely recommend bumping up into Teege's level three system which includes a firming serum and an eye cream. Now you might think, well, you know, I don't know how to use this stuff. And that's where Teej makes it super simple. You get your box, you open it up, and then you see this card. This card is going to tell you what to do, when to do it, and how much of the product to use.

You definitely don't want to miss out so click that link to get started today. So let's talk about three specific things you can do to make a great first impression related to another non-verbal form of communication, body language. Number one, when you first meet someone and you go in for a handshake, make sure it's firm but that you're not gripping too hard. A firm handshake will appear confident, too hard, and you'll be that guy. Number two, stand or sit up straight and hold your head up. When you do this, you present yourself as comfortable and confident. And number three, avoid crossing your arms or legs. If you do this, it subliminally closes you off to the other person and projects that you might not really be interested in listening to them or hearing what they have to say. So one of the things that will contribute to someone having a great first impression of you is if you are able to create a positive environment and a positive experience for them. And the simple way to do that is to be positive and optimistic. People love being around optimists. Being positive lifts people up, makes them feel good, and generally makes you someone that people want to be around. A positive person is approachable. A negative person, people don't really gravitate towards. So keep it positive and use this next tip to turn it up a notch. Okay, so part of creating that positive environment is to put the other person at ease. And there's no better way to do that than with a very sincere smile. A genuine smile will create an impression of trust and sincerity. Now sometimes you might think you're smiling and you're really not, which is why I honestly recommend practicing smiling in a mirror. And the thing you want to pay attention to is how your face feels when you smile. So try to memorize that feeling and then recreate it when you're in that situation. Now be careful that you don't go too overboard with the smile. It's got to be genuine because a fake smile or a smile that's too big will come off as insincere. An important thing to keep in mind when it comes to first impressions is that people will always remember how you made them feel. If they didn't like their interaction with you, then you've definitely not made a good first impression. You can help the other person come away with a good feeling if you listen to them. If you talk too much and don't listen enough, that comes off as rude, overbearing, and that you're not interested in them. Listening shows that you're being attentive and it lets the other person know that they're being heard. And another way to let someone know that they're being heard is by asking questions. And there are two different types of questions to ask, each one of them with a different aim. An open-ended question like, what is art or who inspires you? That's gonna let the person know that you're interested in them. A closed question like pet sounds or revolver, that'll help you focus in on something more specific. Ideally, you're mixing it up, but you know, don't overthink it, just be sure to listen and engage. So the previous tips, definitely important to making a great first impression, but probably the most important thing is to remember to be yourself. People pick up on insincerity extremely quickly. So be authentic, be yourself. That's going to make you feel more confident. It's going to help you build trust with that person as well as earn their respect. Now what happens if you don't make a good first impression? Like, you know, at that point have you completely screwed up this relationship forever? Because it can seem like an absolutely impossible task to recover from something like that. If this has happened to you and you felt this way, what you should know is that it is definitely possible to come back from something like that. And here is a blueprint to help you do that. The first thing you need to do is accept it. Use some self-awareness, go back, replay the interaction in your mind, and identify what you could have or should have done differently. Next, find that person and admit your mistake. Apologize if you have to. to something like that is gonna go a long way to repairing that relationship. Then once you've done that, forget about it. It happened, it's in the past now, let's focus on the future. And finally, you need to be consistent with your positive actions going forward because it takes time to build trust and especially to repair trust. So be sure that every future interaction is positive. Thanks once again to Teach Hanley for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " The most important thing you want when you're building a fall outerwear collection is to know that you've got something appropriate to wear in any situation. I mean, obviously the most important thing you want is to be warm, but stick with me. If you only have a coat for your formal clothes, that's not going to look right if you try to wear it with a casual outfit. And if you've only got a casual coat, that's definitely not going to look right if you're more dressed up. That's why what you really want to have is options and options that are going to work in a range of styles from casual to dressed up and everything in between. I've put together five pieces that I think represent the perfect fall outerwear capsule wardrobe. I'll tell you what those are and show you how you can style them right after this. I'm Brian Zacaua. This is He Spoke Style. Advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style and be more confident. Now all of the outerwear pieces I'm going to be featuring in this video are by Lestrange London, today's video sponsor. You know, when the brand approached me to work together, I started scrolling on the website and I knew immediately that one, this was going to be a great fit for my own personal style and two, that this was a brand I think you should know about if you haven't heard of them already. Lestrange London, luxury menswear brand from London and what I love most about them is that they're focused on doing more with less. So versatility, one of the key parts of what they're all about. Basically have less stuff, do more with it in a variety of situations. Which sounds a lot like what I talk about all the time here on the channel. Their entire collection, in addition to being incredibly versatile, is focused on quality and uses only renewable and recycled materials so they're able to reduce their impact on the environment. The fit, as you'll see shortly, is outstanding and if you'd like to check out any of the pieces I'm featuring in this video, I've got links down below in the description. Alright, so now let's jump in and take a look at my five must-have outerwear pieces for fall. Our first piece here is an all-time classic, a lightweight Macintosh. They call this the modular Mac. It's made from a mix of organic cotton and recycled nylon. It's water repellent with a PFC free finish, which means that no environmentally damaging chemicals were used in the process of creating it. The best thing about a Mac and what makes it so easy to style is just how simple and straightforward it is. This one has a zip up front with snap closures, which gives it just a really clean look. Two outer pockets, an inner pocket on the right, and we have another inner pocket with a zip closure. A lightweight Mac like this should be a staple of your business casual wardrobe, as well as more dressed up officer tire. Here we've got a really simple business casual look. Striped shirt, navy cotton pants, mid brown derbies, Belt, Vacheron Traditionel on the wrist. Pretty much about as simple and classic as you can get. You know, when I think about business casual, I always feel like it needs to have a little bit of sportiness to it. Easy way to do that is to add in a little pattern here. That's with the striped shirt, which in addition to being sporty, helps add some visual contrast to the solid coat and trousers. Now, with just a few tweaks, we can smarten this look up and dress it up a little more. First, adding a striped tie. You can pair similar patterns long as the scale of the patterns are different. Second, throwing on a sport coat with a mini houndstooth or puppy tooth pattern. Third, swapping out the derbies for a pair of oxfords. And just like that with a few small changes, we go from business casual to something slightly more professional. And even though this look is more dressed up, you can still see that the Mac is the perfect finishing touch. So this next piece here is one of my favorite pieces of outerwear for fall and that is a quilted vest. It's got a zip up front, two outside pockets, one inner pocket. It's made with 100% recycled polyester. It's extremely lightweight but it will keep you warm and it's not very bulky which is what you want because in addition to being a great standalone piece of outerwear, it also works extremely well as a layering piece. Now just to drive home how easily these pieces can move throughout your wardrobe and really change the whole vibe of an outfit. I'm gonna start with the same foundation as the last two looks so, Shripe shirt, Navy cotton pants, but changing up the footwear to some suede penny loafers and of course suede belt to match. Over that I'm adding the vest and we've got another classic and slightly sporty look. And although everything here is fairly monochromatic there are a few elements, subtle elements that add a little flavor. Of course the stripe of the shirt is the most striking from a distance but then the quilting of the jacket provides some texture and likewise the suede from the loafers. I mentioned that a vest is a great layering piece as well and here we're gonna layer it up and smarten it up with the addition of a tie as well as the Mac. This particular look is a great example of how these first two outerwear pieces can work together in addition to being extremely versatile individually. I like how the layered vests add some sportiness here even though this is a more professional kind of look. I think it's a good match particularly with the tie since it does have a bit more of a preppy feel to it. Quilted vest is great for casual styles as well. Here I've got it styled with a tan turtleneck, some medium blue jeans, a pair of Chelsea boots, speedy on the wrist, and some classic club master sunglasses. For me, turtleneck plus jeans plus quilted vest always equals a great fall outfit. It's got a little bit of a rugged outdoorsy feel but also some sophistication via the turtleneck and the chelsea's. Great for a weekend brunch or taking a walk to to look at the beautiful leaves. So keeping things casual here with the next item, an olive green work shirt known as the 24 Overshirt. It's made with a thicker stretch cotton, which is 100% organic. It's got a snap up front, snaps on the cuff, single breast pocket and two side pockets. It's extremely functional, can be worn either as a shirt or a jacket though, personally, I prefer it as the latter. which is exactly how I'm styling it here. Light wash jeans, classic athletic sweatshirt, ox blood boots, and Arabic dial Seiko 5 on the wrist. For any over shirt like this, I do look for one that is a little roomier, so I am able to layer it over a sweatshirt like this or a thicker sweater. And I typically wear this if I'm doing workout in the yard or something, so the roomier fit gives me the freedom of movement that I want and just keeps it more comfortable in general. Next, still keeping a bit of that rugged vibe, but prepping it up just slightly. Just a plain white t-shirt underneath, and then some suede penny loafers, along with some cream colored socks for a very, very little nod to Ivy style. You know, a lot of times you might wonder how you can do something different with jeans, you know, other than like a classic minimal white sneaker, which I'll admit is often a go-to of mine. And a pair of suede loafers is an easy tweak to make. I think it looks more considered, maybe a little more quote unquote advanced and an interesting contrast with the ruggedness of the overshirt. Must have fall outerwear piece number four is a half zip sweater. This one right here is made with 100% extra fine Reno wool. Now that description of the fabric might make it seem like this, you know, wouldn't be substantial enough as a piece of outerwear, but this is thicker than what you would think of as a typical layering sweater. and definitely has a good amount of heft to keep you warm. Styling wise, it's quite simple. Of course, there's zipper right here, and the collar has a really nice piping detail around the edge. I consider the half zip sweater to be one of those essential pieces when it comes to dressy casual and business casual attire. And I've styled it very much in that mold here with a simple white button up, khaki cotton pants, suede tassel loafers with a tone on tone sock combination, and the Cartier Tank American on my wrist. Super simple and classic look that does have a sporty feel to it, thanks to the zipper. One other thing to point out that I really love about this particular sweater is the collar. A lot of half sips have a more stand-up collar, but I prefer the style and feel of the turned-down collar here. For our fifth piece of outerwear, we have the all-time classic casual staple, the hoodie. but this hoodie is different from any other hoodie you've probably seen before. It's made with a super soft organic cotton, but it really does feel much more like a jacket. Part of the reason is that it's lined, so not only are you getting some extra warmth, but you've also got two inside pockets, which are very practical. And of course, it's got the two outer pockets, as well as a breast pocket, which I think is a really nice styling detail and practical as well. So here is a really classic casual hoodie outfit idea that is so easy to throw together. Just white t-shirt, light wash jeans, white sneakers, but keeping it a little more interesting on the wrist with my Hoyer Carrera Blue Dreamer. So although this is a hoodie, it doesn't really wear like one. Because it is lined, it's got a little more structure and heft. And the addition of the breast pocket, I think helps elevate it as well. Definitely feels more grown up and luxurious than your regular old run of the mill hoodie. One thing I wanna know about this particular piece from Lestrange is that it is a little more form fitting. I'm wearing a size medium here, which is the size I got in everything else. And it does have a little bit of a slimmer profile to it. This is the large and you can see I have some more room though it is a bit longer. So if I was going to keep this one, I would just roll up and tuck under the bottom whenever I wore it. So the idea of doing more with less is an idea that I think is great to embrace when you're building your wardrobe or any part of it, like your outerwear collection, for example. Now, if you've been thinking about completely revamping your wardrobe and building something truly versatile from the ground up, but aren't totally sure where to start, check out that video I've got linked right over there because I made it just for someone like you. I take you through the 25 basic items you need to have, to have you covered from casual to dressed up along with many outfit ideas to illustrate just how versatile it is."

        "transcript": " So it's fall now and today we're talking all about casual fall style. Just to be clear, there is nothing wrong with a simple outfit, especially when you're dressing casually. But have you ever felt like this, you know, when you get dressed, it's fine, but then you wonder, what can I do to make this better? For fall style, very simple. And doing this one thing is an easy way to transform and upgrade your casual fall style. I'm Brian Sakawa. This is He Spoke Style. Advice and inspiration to help you dress well, develop your personal style, and be more confident. So one thing I believe is that if you put time, thought, and effort into something, people will notice. When you go that extra mile, it's obvious. Now, in a style context, this doesn't necessarily mean being obvious or flashy or showing off in some way. It could be more of a feeling people get when they see you, not necessarily something they can really put their finger on. These types of details, the ones that you're aware of, but other people don't really see in an obvious way are, in my opinion, the best ones because they exude a sort of style and classiness that you don't get if something's super obvious. So for casual fall style, the secret to achieving this is by adding to your wardrobe staple pieces in luxury fabrics. There's a big difference between say how a cotton sweatshirt looks and feels compared to a cashmere sweatshirt. There's a big difference between how a cotton t-shirt looks and feels compared to a silk t-shirt. I've got five different looks to show you exactly what I'm talking about coming up, but first I want to introduce you to and say thanks to our sponsor for today's video, Lily Silk. be featuring a couple of cashmere pieces from LilySilk as well as the silk knitted t-shirt you just saw. But in addition to clothing, LilySilk has a wide product range of everything you can imagine with silk including pajamas, pillowcases, bedding sets and more like this eye mask that I just got a lot of use out of on some overseas flights. Now I know this video is about casual fall style but if you've never tried silk sleepwear and bedding, I highly recommend it. In addition to just being super comfortable, silk has many other benefits as well, including being naturally hypoallergenic, antibacterial, breathable, thermal regulating, lightweight, durable, and long lasting. The brand is committed to zero waste production and they work with TerraCycle to help ensure that they're creating as little waste as possible. Fabric remains, they actually used to make things like this silk eye mask, and all Lily Silk products are clean and toxin free with Okotex certification. There's a link in the description to check out LilySilk. You can save 12% off everything with code HSS12. And then for men's and women's apparel and sleepwear specifically, you can buy one and get one for 25% off with code HSS25. Okay, now jumping into our five different looks showcasing how you can use luxury fabrics to upgrade your casual fall style. Look number one, starting off with a simple combo of light wash jeans, black silk t-shirt. For that, I'm layering this lily silk cashmere hoodie, minimal white sneakers, and a casually elegant watch, which makes for a very simple classic fall combination. Over the past few years, I've been all about upgrading some of my casual staples to luxury fabrics like this sweatshirt. Not only does it feel great when you wear it, but I also feel like it has a little bit more of a mature vibe to it that also projects confidence. So this look great for a fall day. If it does happen to be a little cooler and you need some extra warmth, what you could do is to just add a navy pico, flip the hood outside, and you've still got a very classic look that's going to keep you warm. Our second look here, in addition to having some cashmere as a luxury fabric, is going to be focused primarily on texture. We've got the cable knit on the sweater, quilting on the vest, and the suede of the chukkas in the belt. Texture, excellent way to not only add some visual interest and depth to your look, but But it also gives it an overall richness, which helps to elevate the overall appearance. Next up, we've got a very simple country casual look. Foundation here is this tan lily silk cashmere crew neck sweater paired with some kind of mid blue colored jeans. Over that, throwing on a wax cotton jacket, some pebble grain wing tips, and pilot's watch on the wrist. Even something like this with a little bit more of a rugged feel benefits from and is elevated by adding in a cashmere sweater. Soft and comfortable, classic and stylish. For me, this is really something of a casual fall uniform. I love it for when I just need to run out. So simple to put together, really requires no thought. And if you wanted to dress it up a little bit, you could very easily throw on a button down shirt underneath the sweater, and you're good to go. Little nod to my military career here with this one. Again, very simple, black silk t-shirt with some light wash jeans, olive linen safari jacket, got some oxblood boots, speedy on the wrist, and some classic sunglasses. Even though we think of linen as a summer fabric, if it's a heavier weight, it makes a really great summer to fall transition piece. I mentioned earlier in the video that there's a big difference between how a cotton t-shirt looks and feels compared to a silk one, and it really is true. This particular t-shirt has definitely replaced to my old cotton one. I love how it feels. Love how I can move in it. Highly recommended. Got the t-shirt once again in this look which I kind of consider sort of a grown up rock and roll look. A little softer, not quite as edgy, but you know, still has that vibe. Of course, black t-shirt, black jeans, classic rock and roll foundation. Instead of a leather jacket which would be an obvious choice. We've got this quarter right trucker, brown leather Chelsea boots, Arabic dials Seiko 5. Love this watch and smartening it up a little bit with some specs. People always want to know if brown and black can work together. Yes it can. I'm a big fan. I love the warm tones when you've got lighter browns like we do here. It's a nice color contrast and brown in general gives off a really rich appearance. Thank you very much once again to Lily Silk for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " Robin, I'm gonna talk about you on YouTube. Did she hear? Is she coming? Well, maybe I don't want her to hear this anyway. All right, if you follow this channel for a while, you have met my wife, Robin. You've seen her in a few Q&As. She's helped me pick the best date night colognes and she's even chosen what she believes to be my best outfits ever. She's not gonna be on today, but I'm gonna talk about her because we've been married for about five years now And in that time, I've learned a lot from her about life that has definitely made me a much better person than before I met her. So let's jump right into the five life lessons that Robin has taught me. [\"I Am an Only Child\"] So I am an only child and I am an INTJ. I'm not very outgoing. I like to kind of keep to myself quiet and comfortable just sitting quietly with someone and not really speaking. Doesn't bother me. Doesn't feel weird or anything like that. Robin on the other hand is not that way. Can we roll that clip? Keep things in. I'm not a big communicator, but you are. Well, I might be an over communicator. So I think there is the balance of... She said it, not me. Robin loves to talk about how she feels. It doesn't come naturally to me. I guess it's kind of weird though when I think about it because in work scenarios, I'm pretty upfront with people. Like if I have an issue with someone or they did something to f*** me off or whatever, I will immediately address that thing with them. So yeah, it's weird that I don't apply that to our relationship, but it's something that Robin has helped me with and it's definitely improved our relationship and certainly made me more confident in other situations as well. One thing I have always loved about Robin is her natural beauty. She doesn't wear a lot of makeup and when she does, it's just kind of to enhance her natural features, not like to cover anything up or anything. She looks the same in the morning when we wake up next to each other as she does midway through the day. I like that. And that's not a miracle. That is because she takes obsessively good care of her skin. Every day, morning and night, she goes through this routine because it's important to her because she knows that the only way to maintain her great skin, her great complexion, and especially as she gets older, to stay looking youthful, is to have that routine and not wait until it's too late. I really admire that, but I'm a guy and I see all these things that she uses from all these different brands. And to me, that seems kind of overwhelming. I mean, I care about it, but I personally need a solution and routine that is simplified in every way and just laid out there for me. That's why I have absolutely loved Teege Hanley, who I'm proud to partner with for today's video, because they literally give me everything that I'm looking for and that I need. So if Teege is new to you, all you really need to do to get started, to do the things that you need to do is their basic plan. Face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, AM moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun, and PM moisturizer for that important repair process that goes on while you sleep. Personally, because I am pushing 45 years old, I really like Tejas level three system because it includes a firming serum and an eye cream. Now, I said this really simplifies things for me. So let me explain exactly what I mean. And it It starts as soon as you get the box in the mail. You open it up and then you see this card. And this card is everything. It tells you exactly what to do, when to do it, and how much of the product you need to use.

So click that link to get started today. Okay let me just say that I am not a sloppy person. I hope that you can probably tell that if you know me through these videos. Sometimes though, it's hard to keep things neat. Like when we're in the studio working and making a video, an outfit video specifically, it just becomes a complete disaster down here. It's like my closet explodes all over the studio, which is fine if I picked it up, but the way my life is now, I just sometimes don't have the time or I don't make the time to put everything back where it belongs and need in the space up. So when it comes to the next time we need to work, it's a mess to start with and it it gets even messier from there. And the worst part about it is not necessarily the mess, though that's definitely bad too, but it's the way that it affects me. It stresses me out, it makes me anxious, I'm less productive, everything suffers as a result. Now, studio aside from time to time, our house is immaculate. Like everything is put away, perfectly styled, there's no clutter. It looks like a freaking magazine, honestly. And that is because Robin is obsessive about keeping it this way for the exact same reasons that I can't stand when the studio is a disaster. It seems like a simple thing to do, but it's not easy. You have to make the time, dedicated time, to keep things neat and organized. You'll learn why it's sometimes hard for me in the next section of this video, but following Robin's example here does improve my stress productivity and overall just kind of feeling good about things. So, related to this specific thing, work-life balance, one of the stories that Robin loves to tell about me goes like this. So it was before we were married, she's still living in New York City and pretty much every other weekend I'd be up there and we'd hang out, go out to eat, explore the city. So this particular time, I think we'd probably just finish eating at Little Prince, which is a really nice casual little French place, and right around there, kind of right at the corner of Sixth and Prince's little park, and there are benches, and Robin suggested that we sit down and I smoke a cigar. And I kind of half jokingly said, why don't we just sit and do nothing? That's time that we could be doing something else, like being productive or whatever. So I tend to be a workaholic, and that's generally the way I think. If I'm not doing something or working more specifically, that's time I'm wasting and I'm not gonna be able to get as much done as I should. Robin, however, is much better at drawing lines between, okay, I'm working now and I'm done with that and now it's time to relax. It wasn't the easiest thing for me to embrace having operated in a completely different way for a very long time and I have to admit that I sort of felt lazy at first, but as things have changed in my life, whether that's having more seniority and responsibility in my army job, and if you're new here and haven't followed the channel and didn't know that about me, I talk more about it in that video that I've got linked right up there. And with all that and trying to keep up with Eastpoke style, which has continued to grow, it would be very easy to get to a point where I'm just completely burned out. So I've learned, and Robin has helped teach me about the value of downtime and what it does to recharge you physically, mentally, and emotionally. I've always been really thankful and appreciative of all the things that we have, the life we've made for ourselves. I'm pretty good at that. And when it comes to being thankful and showing gratitude towards others, it's something I definitely feel inside, but it's also something I don't express outwardly maybe as much as I should. is great at this. She's one of the most caring people I've ever met and it doesn't matter who. Friends, family, coworkers, she always goes out of her way to tell people that she appreciates them, the job they've done and even just like randomly texting someone she hasn't talked to in a while, let them know that she's thinking about them. Like I said, I feel it inside and sometimes I just assume that people can tell and that they definitely should know that I'm grateful for them, But as I'm told, that is not always the case. Like for example, when Robin and I are getting ready to go out, she comes out, she looks amazing. I clearly see that, and I assume that she can see that I see that. But if I don't say anything, there's no way for her to really know, right? When it comes to gratitude and you really break it down, it does kind of seem pretty simple. But for some people, like me, it just takes that little extra effort to actually express it outwardly. But when you do, not only is it something that goes a long way and is very meaningful to the person you're expressing it to, but it also makes you feel good to know that you've had a positive impact on someone.

        "transcript": " Those of you who know me and who've watched this channel for a while know that I've had varying opinions on suit supply over the years But you'll recall that one of those opinions was that I really believe that they offer a great value to quality ratio And today I've partnered with suit supply to show you ten of my favorite pieces in the collection right now Take you through the entire custom made process from start to finish and then put together six different outfits all that right after this I'm Brian Sakawa, this is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress better, develop your personal style, and be more confident. Alright, let's jump right in and take a look at the 10 items I picked up. Up first we have this off-white knit polo. It's a mix of cotton and silk, 70% cotton, 30% silk, light and breathable. The placket is buttonless so it has a very chic look. Pull-out of course is a wardrobe essential and this is a really unique and elegant take on that. Here we have a classic crew neck sweater in a cream color. It's marina wool, very soft, super comfortable, great foundational piece. Up next we've got the first of a few tailored items starting off with this beautiful brown Houndstooth Sportco. This is the Havana model linen wool silk and cotton blend. It's got a great feel in the hand. It's a two button notch lapel patch pockets. We've got working sleeve buttons completely unlined as you can see. Very very comfortable great casual sport coat that I think every guy should have. Next is this really cool black field jacket. It's made with 100% linen has a lot of heft to it so the jacket really keeps a very nice structure despite the fact that it is unstructured. It's got four flapped patch pockets, snap closures on the front and actually inside it has a drawstring feature so you can cinch it up, give it a little more shape and sort of kind of tailor it to your own body or your own style. So one of the biggest gripes I've had with suit supply clothing in the past is their pants. Maybe about five or six years ago, I bought a couple pairs and they just didn't fit me well. Even with alterations, there was something that just wasn't right. What's funny is that when I went to the Soho showroom to get fitted for my suit, which we'll get to in just a bit, they remembered how much I did not like the fit of the pants in the past. And they said that since then they actually made some updates, they fit differently now and that I should give them a try again. So I did that with this pair of black linen trousers. So before talking about the fit, let's go over a few of the details here. This is the Braden model. It's 100% linen from Baird McNutt. It's got two reverse pleats. We've got side adjusters and then we have this overlapping closure on the front. Now one thing is that this particular pair of pants comes with a cuff. Some ready-to-wear styles do, some don't. Personally, I don't like cuffs on my linen pants so they were able to take that out for me and make them plain bottom. Overall these are super elegant, love the details, great alternative to cotton pants and the fit, I have to say that suit supply was right. They fit amazing as you'll see when I style them later on in the video. Another pair of trousers here, these are the Ames made with a tropical wool from VBC. Really nice mid-brown color, very versatile. They have an elastic waistband. It's a button closure, but you've also got a drawstring feature here as well. They have a single reverse pleat, and then the bottoms are also elastic. So interestingly, these were too long for me and they were actually able to shorten them even with the elastic cuff. Very cool mix of sporty and elegant. At first, they did seem a little bit outside my comfort zone, but when I actually put them on, I really loved how they wore. Extremely comfortable. And as a result, dare I say that these just might be the ultimate travel pant to wear it when you're flying. The next item I kind of joked about and called it the dad vest, but this is like the coolest dad vest you'll ever find. It's reversible. This side is actually water repellent and then you could flip it around for something a little softer, a little softer looking, a little more texture. One thing I want to point out is that both sides of this jacket have pockets. I've seen reversible vests like this before where one side doesn't have a pocket. So that's a really cool feature of this one. Here is just a simple white button-up shirt made within Egyptian cotton. That is incredibly soft. It's not actually quite that simple though because as you can see it's not meant to be buttoned up all the way as it doesn't have a button here or up by the collar. And my favorite feature of this shirt is actually the collar. It's a tab collar and I really like the shape that it has when it's buttoned. Some footwear here now, a pair of sneakers. We've got a nice taupe suede upper along with a white sole. All the pieces I picked so far, I chose these because I think they're a great mix of sporty and chic. So I have always been impressed with suit supplies ready to wear garments, specifically their tailored pieces and even more specifically their sport coats. Over the years I've owned several suit supply sport coats. I wore them all the time. They fit great. I never needed any alterations. The fabrics are fantastic and I think they represent an incredible value especially as a ready-to-wear option. But the one thing I had never experienced at Suit Supply was their custom program and I was extremely excited to try it for the first time recently at their SoHo showroom, a place that I've wandered around many, many times. One of the newer features of the showroom that I got to see for the very first time is their rooftop lounge, which in addition to just having an amazing view of the city is some place that you can go, kick back, relax, have a drink either while you're waiting for your appointment or for some alterations to be completed. Let's talk a little more specifics about Suit Supplies' custom-made program and what they offer. So they can pretty much make you whatever you need for whatever you might need it for, whether that's work, a special event like a wedding, and even more casual styles. Suits, jackets, trousers, shirts, waistcoats, overcoats, evening wear, a huge range. I've already talked about their fabrics being fantastic and for the Custom Made Program, they do offer a full range of what you would call four season fabrics as well as seasonal books for more luxury European and Italian mills. Now one of the things I always tell people when they're going into a custom clothing experience like this is to do your research and really kind of know what you want before you actually go to your appointment. And one thing I really like about the suit supply process is that you're able to go through a portion of it online where you can see all the options you have, whether that's lapel styles, buttons, colors, tons of stuff. So you're more prepared and then you can save that configuration for when you go into the store where you're measured and really able to dial things in, get that perfect fit, feel the fabrics and make that connection to a garment that you'll have and wear for many years. And as a bonus, when you do that, it's also more sustainable. I thoroughly enjoyed the process from dialing in all my details. Yes, even I like to get some suggestions when I'm doing custom to the measuring process where I was able to talk about certain fit things that I liked or things that I didn't like. All of that was taken into account. I tend to be very picky and particular when it comes to this stuff. And I have to say that when I got the suit, which is a two to three week delivery time, I felt like they nailed it. So for my suit, you know, I'm super classic. So I decided to go with a charcoal gray double breasted suit. It's a very nice VBC Super 110s fabric. The jacket I did with a Peek LaPel. This is their standard width, which is about three and a half inches. You could also go with a wider version, which is about four and a half inches. It's six button. We've got dark brown buttons here. It's got a double vent. I went with jetted pockets because I wanted this to be a little bit more on the formal side. And now at Suit Supply, you have the option of full canvas, half canvas or unconstructed. Here I went with a full canvas and that's gonna mold to the shape of my body over time and make the jacket fit even better. For the pants, just got rid of the jacket. I went with a single pleat, which I always do side adjusters and a two inch cuff. If you know me, no surprise there. So that's how I styled this suit, but how does it fit? Well, we'll find out right now as we jump into our six different looks. So here we go, starting out with the full suit and styling it probably not in the way that you were expecting. Everything I picked out I feel is very chic yet casual. So I wanted to style the suit in a way that reflected that. So instead of a shirt and tie, we've got the cream colored crew neck sweater, simple, elegant and definitely that casual chic vibe that I'm trying to carry over to my accessories as well with the chunky black sunglasses, JLC Reverso on the wrist and finished off with a pair of black suede Belgians. Even though I'm wearing the jacket unbuttoned, you can still see that it fits amazing in the shoulders. Sleeve length is perfect, and it feels great across the body. Trousers also perfect fit. They've got a higher rise, which I love. Super comfortable. Length is absolutely perfect, just how I like them. Leg width and opening, also perfect. I said before that they nailed the suit, and here's the proof. Here we are with look number two, a nice sporty elevated casual weekend look. You've got the reversible body warmer, which I call the dad vest, layered over the crew neck sweater and white button up, paired with some light wash jeans, white baseball cap, two-tone suede sneakers, and a little piece of nostalgia on the wrist. Anytime you're looking for ways to elevate casual attire, the absolute best way is to give some of your basic pieces a little bit of a luxury upgrade. Here, that's the sweater, vest, and shoes, all in materials that look great, and feel great as well. For look number three, I'm going with the Houndstooth Sportcoat, pairing it with the knit polo, black linen trousers, sneakers, and my traditional on the wrist. Again, this combo, very simple, but we've got the pattern of the jacket, the slightly unexpected knit polo, pleated trousers, suede sneakers, and a really elegant color palette coming together to take everything up a notch. Once again, just wanna say how super impressed I am with the trousers, like the suit trousers, the fit of these, perfect as well. Length is great, leg width is perfect, I love the pleats and closure details, higher rise feels more mature and very elegant. Here we have look number four, and can I just say that I am absolutely loving the color palette that is available in the current suit supply lineup. I'm a sucker for brown, I love dressing tonally, so this is kind of like a match made in heaven here. Back to the look, we've got the reversible vest again, layered over the crew neck, and paired with the drawstring trousers and sneakers. So to be completely honest, I love these trousers. I didn't think I would, but I do. They're such a neat mix of dressy and sporty, and just ridiculously comfortable. I said that these are great for travel, and I just took an overseas trip, and I wore them, and I can confirm that they are a great option to wear on a long plane trip. For look number five, we've got a sort of rugged but chic safari suit vibe going on with the linen field jacket paired with the linen trousers. It's a great match and adding some contrast with the knit polo and sneakers once again. I mentioned earlier that you can cinch down the size of this jacket on the inside and that's what I've done here. You can see that it gives it a little more shape around my body. I know a lot of guys like the idea of a suit but the level of formality doesn't really fit their lifestyle. Something like this though, with a more casual style jacket, is a great way to kind of keep that suit ethos, but also keep it kind of casual. Look number six now, we've got what I would consider a very classic business casual-ish combo. Hounds 2 sport coat, white button up, light wash jeans, suede sneakers. Wearing a sport coat with jeans, gotta be the right fabric, and we've got that here. Patch pockets, keep it casual, and the pattern helps break up the simple foundation. This is a super easy kind of go-to outfit for me. I love mixing sporty and tailored. It's no nonsense and always just a great way to elevate your look. Really wanna thank Suit Supply once again for sponsoring this video. All these pieces are great basics, incredibly versatile, and you guys know that I love the idea of having less that you can do more with. We call that a capsule wardrobe, and that playlist over there will help you get started building one, whether you're a beginner, a professional, or if you're going on vacation."

        "transcript": " If you think being successful is going to make you more confident, you're wrong. And you've actually got it backwards. You need to be confident in order to be successful. Because think about it. Why would anyone believe in you if you don't believe in yourself? If you are tired of feeling like you are at the mercy of everything and everyone around you from a shitty boss to a dead-end job and everything in between, let me help you change your situation. And if you apply the nine strategies we're going to talk about end of this video, you will be a different person. I'm Brian Sakawa. This is He Spoke Style, advice and inspiration to help you dress better, develop your personal style and yes, be more confident. The first thing I want to do is to dispel the myth that in order to be confident that you've got to be loud, extroverted and aggressive. It's easy to think this because people who act this way often do appear confident, but The way they're presenting themselves is actually that person compensating or overcompensating for their lack of confidence in themselves and their abilities and their insecurities. Confidence or a lack of confidence is something that's created throughout your life. The opinions of your parents, your teachers, your friends all help to build up that confidence or destroy it. And the reason is because we care about what people think. But if you get to a point where that fear of how someone is going to perceive you takes over and controls everything you're doing and every choice you're making, then you've gotten to a point where you are not in control anymore and you're judging yourself based on what others think and not what you believe. So we need to get rid of that fear. We need to get rid of that inner criticism that is holding you back from living the kind of life that you want. And the first step to doing that is to take an honest look at yourself and to know yourself very well. Self reflection is ground zero for improving your confidence. Knowing everything about what's inside you is going to help you start believing in yourself and your abilities. If you don't know what you want, how are you going to get it? Self reflection can be difficult and it's important that you're honest with yourself. Get a notebook and start writing things down. What do you want? How do you feel? What sets you off? There's no right or wrong way to do this, so do whatever feels right for you. And as you're going through this, one of the things I want you to do is to create a list of your strengths. Don't forget what you're good at. Having a list that you can refer back to will help you remember all the positive things you have to offer, which is especially helpful when you feel discouraged. Also, if you have a clear understanding of your strengths, that's going to be like armor that'll protect you against any needless feedback or criticism that you might get on on a daily basis, like at work, for example. That list is the easy part. This next list, not so easy, because what you also need to do is to make a list of your weaknesses. And once you've identified your weaknesses, those are the things that you're going to want to work on the hardest. Make plans for how to improve them. Figure out ways to minimize their negative impact. It's easy to sit back and coast on the things you're good at. But if you know that you have these weaknesses and you're not working on them, that's not gonna make them go away. Over time, that's just gonna reinforce any doubts that you have about yourself. People with talent who don't practice or work on stuff only get so far in life. It's the people that dig in and do the hard work on the things that they can't do or aren't so good at. Those are the people who eventually have greater success. The next two strategies we're gonna talk about have to do with appearance. And let me just say that caring about your appearance is not vain. there's a big difference between conceit and confidence. And one thing I know for sure is that if you look in the mirror and you're not happy with what you see, you are not gonna be confident when you step outside into the world. The first thing we're gonna focus on is skincare because your face is one of your most important assets when it comes to your appearance. And to take the best care of your face, you need to make it a habit and part of your daily routine. I used to go in fits and starts when it came to skincare. I'd start and then I'd stop. And it was usually because there was like too much out there to choose from and not enough guidance. That's why I love Teesh Hanley, who I'm proud to partner with for today's video because they make it so easy to start and stick with it. If Teesh is new to you, they have many different products but all you really need to get started is their basic plan. Now that's a face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, and moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun and a PM moisturizer for the important repair process that happens while you sleep. I'm almost 45 years old, and if you're like me, I'd recommend bumping up to Tisha's level three system that adds in a firming serum and an eye cream. But let's get back to the part where I said it's easy. So when you get your box in the mail and open it up, it comes with a card. That card tells you what to do, when to do it, and how much of the product to use. And it gets even simpler because when you subscribe, You don't even have to think about going out to get more when you run out because it automatically comes to your door every month. Now, in addition to great skin, when you join Tees, you get tons of perks as well, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, pause or cancel at any time. There are no hassle refunds and there's free US shipping as well as low-cost shipping to most other countries. And because Tees Handley is sponsoring today's video, they're offering you guys a great deal, All you got to do is click the first link in the description to get TeachHandley for 30% off and you can choose a DoppKit, HandTal, or Body Wash and Scrubber combo as a free gift. So click that link to get started today. All right, the next thing we need to talk about in terms of appearance is how you dress. Like it or not, the clothing you wear, how it fits you, your accessories, all those things communicate something about you. It affects every relationship you have, how you're perceived, what group you belong to, or want to belong to, and it's a direct reflection of what you're going to get out of your day. How you dress is completely up to you, and it's dependent on your personal style, your situation, and what you want to get out of life. But however it is you choose to dress, if you put some time and effort into it and do it with intention, people will notice and you'll be more confident. Now, nothing boosts your confidence more than when you win at something. And the bigger the win, the bigger the boost. But if you're only focusing on those big victories, you are missing out on a lot of smaller ones. Think about your day. You probably get a lot of stuff done, a lot of stuff you overlook and don't consider a victory. But they are. They're things you've accomplished. That's a good thing. And the best way to see these things and celebrate that you've accomplished something is to make a list at the beginning of the day and cross things off. Seeing what you've done every day will give you a huge boost. Let's circle back to the myth that in order to be more confident that you have to be loud, extroverted, and aggressive. Aggressiveness is not confidence. If you respond to someone aggressively, that's a sign that you're insecure about something. You can be assertive without being aggressive, and that is something worth practicing. But you've got to know yourself and your insecurities to do that. But being assertive without being aggressive will boost your confidence. When you're good at something, you know how that feels right? It feels good and it automatically boosts your self confidence. So if you could get better at more things, it would follow that your confidence would also keep increasing. That's why it's important to continue to seek out opportunities to learn and grow throughout your life. Of course, great place to start is that list you made of your weaknesses, but it can be anything that interests you from a hobby to your work life. Define what that is and set a realistic amount of time that you can devote to it every day because getting into a routine is going to be the key to success here. Let's talk about comfort zones. Now a comfort zone feels good, thus the term comfort, but it's also something that can hold you back, discourage you and diminish your confidence. You always regret a chance you didn't take, so step outside of what's comfortable every now and then and try something new. Doesn't have to be crazy either like you don't have to go jumping out of an airplane or something. But think about what you know about yourself. If you're shy maybe it's just going up to a stranger and saying hello. Whatever it is if you face that fear your confidence will improve. Thanks once again to Tish Hanley for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " Okay, I know that weddings can be expensive and that sticking to a budget is extremely important. So, a custom suit or tuxedo may not be in the cards and that's perfectly fine. However, if it does fit within your budget, I highly recommend getting a custom suit or tuxedo made for your wedding. And in this video, I'm going to share five reasons why I think it's a great idea. Reason number one is that it's the best way to get a perfect fit. Before launching this course, I put out a survey to married guys asking them about their biggest style regrets looking back at their wedding day now. And of the hundreds and hundreds of responses I received, having a poorly fitting suit or tuxedo was by far the number one answer. And typically, they attributed that to having worn a rented suit or tuxedo. So we all come in different shapes and sizes and off the rack clothing operates in basically a one size fits all mindset. And if that size doesn't work for you, if you have very specific fit issues, like for example, really broad shoulders or larger thighs, it can be difficult and not to mention frustrating to try and squeeze yourself into this pre-made mold. Alterations can help, but oftentimes they'll only get you so far. So that's why there's no substitute for having a garment made specifically for you in terms of getting that perfect fit. Reason number two is the ability to personalize it and really make it your own. Custom is called custom for a reason and the fact that you have so much control over all the details like linings, pockets, buttons, et cetera, that really gives you an opportunity to add personal touches and personality to your suit or tuxedo. In this sense, I always think about how the bride puts so much time and effort into finding the perfect dress and a dress that really complements her and says something about her. So I feel that if you're able to do the same, that just kind of elevates everything that much more, makes it a bit more special and really adds that extra layer of personalization. One thing to keep in mind though, is that different companies offer different levels of what you're able to customize. So if you're going to go the custom route, definitely do your research before you commit so you know exactly what you can and can't do. Reason number three is that a custom suit or tuxedo will generally be much higher quality than one that's rented. Again, going back to my married guy, wedding day style regrets, Another big one was that people felt, looking back at their photos now, that their wedding suit or tuxedo looked cheap. And not only that, but a lot of them also added that it felt cheap as well. Caveat here is that there are plenty of custom suit companies out there that do produce a very cheap garment. So I'll say that if you're looking into it, if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Two things to pay attention to here are the fabric and the construction. For a decent custom suit in an entry level quality fabric, you should expect to pay somewhere around $500 minimum. As the quality of the fabric gets better, the price will increase. In terms of construction, never buy a custom suit that is fused. That means it's literally glued together. Always opt for a half canvas or a full canvas construction. Reason number four, I recommend getting a custom suit or tuxedo is that it is a special garment you will have for many years to come. Your wedding day is one of those days that you will never forget. And having a custom suit or tuxedo made specifically for that occasion is a great keepsake and reminder of that special day. And if you follow the guidance I've given in the course so far, chances are you might be leaning towards something classic. And the great thing about a classic suit or tuxedo is that it never goes out of style and it will always look good. So even if you don't have opportunities to wear a suit or tuxedo all that often, I'll bet that there will be times you'll need one, whether that's someone else's special event or an anniversary dinner or any other time you and your wife feel like getting dressed up and doing something nice. Having that suit or tux you had made for your wedding and being able to put that on again makes for such a great sentimental connection. And reason number five is that you will be getting a very high return on your investment. Along the same lines of being able to re-wear it and feel that sentimental sense of nostalgia, Being able to re-wear it also makes economic sense. If you're renting a suit or tux, probably going to be spending between $100 and $200 and closer to the top end if you're getting an entire outfit. If there are future occasions where you need to wear a suit or tux and you don't have one, you need to rent one again, you can see how in the long run that cost could easily be higher than if you had one made for your wedding. Even at an entry level price point, a custom suit or tuxedo will pay for itself over time. have to consider it and investment. So there you have it. Those are the five reasons that I really recommend going with a custom suit or tuxedo if it fits in your budget. Just to recap, it's the best way to ensure a perfect fit. It's a great way to add some personalization, generally higher quality. It's a classic garment that you'll always have with the added bonus of that sentimental attachment and it offers a really high return on investment. I know I didn't get into specifics about particular brands so if you have any questions let me know."

        "transcript": " This is the latest addition to my watch collection, the IWC Spitfire Automatic. I absolutely love this watch, and I'm gonna tell you why I think it is so great. The first question you probably have is, why did I choose this particular watch? So as many of you may know, I'm an active duty soldier in the United States Army. For the past 19 years, I've been proud to be a member of the US Army Field Band from Washington, DC. I play the saxophone. I do the announcing for the group, done a lot of media stuff, been to all 50 states, overseas a couple times, played for presidential inaugurations. I mean, like, so much stuff over the years, I could talk for hours about it. But the main point here is I'm in the military. And being in the military, I have always wanted a military watch. So the holy grail of military watches for me would be a Rolex 5513 or 5517 mil sub. But you know, there were like 1200 of those issued and I think that only about 180 of those now are thought to be around today. So they're rare, they're coveted, they're very expensive and it kills me that most of the people who own these watches today were probably never in the military. So mill sub aside, I have looked at some vintage Hamilton and Omega British military watches which are definitely way more affordable, but I don't know, there's something about them just doesn't do it for me. Size wise, I feel they're a little small and I don't mind a 36 millimeter watch, but I don't know, it just does feel a little too small for me as a sportier watch like that. And then there's the fact that I know from previous experience that although I love the idea of vintage watches and I appreciate them. As far as wearing a vintage watch, I just found that it really wasn't my thing. I owned a Rolex GMT Master at 1675. That was from 1977. And over time, I found that, you know, I wasn't wearing it as much and you just kind of have to know yourself. And a vintage watch on my wrist just just just kind of didn't feel like me. I thought about this a lot though, because I've always really, really liked the the IWC Pilots watches, specifically the Mark 18. And that one is one that I've considered off and on for probably the past five or six years. I love its simplicity. I love the tool watch aspect of it. I love the legibility. I love its versatility. But I always felt like there was just something missing from it beyond the movement because that's another story. But just missing something that was enough to keep me from pulling the trigger. And I know for those of us who like these watches that Mark 18 versus Spitfire is kind of a common conundrum, you know, trying to decide between the two. I have to say though, now that I own the Spitfire myself, I feel like if I had gone with the Mark 18, that I would have had some serious buyers or more. So there's just so much I love about this watch. And we'll talk about that in detail, but first I wanna tell you where this watch actually came from. So this watch is brand new. It's got box, papers, original tag, but I did not buy it from the boutique. So this is a $4,800 watch, brand new, and I actually found it for $4,150, brand new box, papers, tag, everything on eBay, who was kind enough to sponsor today's video. This is not the first watch I've gotten on eBay, my Omega Speedmaster, first Omega in space. It's also from eBay. And I know from comments that I've gotten both on Instagram as well as here on the channel that there are some of you who worry about buying a luxury watch on eBay, specifically knowing whether or not it's legit. So having gone through this process twice now, I can tell you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about, but you have to make sure that you are buying a watch through their authenticity guarantee service. And super easy to tell whether this is the case or not because you'll see a big blue check mark next to the listing that lets you know that this particular watch is 100% authentic. I'll say it again, my Spitfire came with the original box, original papers, warranty card, and tag. Any watch you get from eBay's Authenticity Guarantee Service will come with a card, and you can actually tap it to your phone, and you'll get information about your specific authentication as well as an explanation of how the program works. All of this should give you peace of mind that you're actually getting what you think you're getting. eBay's got a huge assortment of watches online, everything from new to vintage with a wide variety of price points. So if you're looking for something specific, maybe something that's not available in the boutique, which honestly is a lot of watches these days. Definitely search for it on eBay because you could potentially find a really great deal like I did. To start your search and to find your own authenticity guaranteed watch, go ahead and click the first link down below in the description. So that's where this watch came from. Now let's take a closer look at the IWC Spitfire Automatic in detail. First I'm gonna focus in on the color scheme here. We've got a steel case, black dial, and olive green textile strap. Very deliberate choices. The watch is inspired by the famous World War II plane, the Super Marine Spitfire. It was a British single seat fighter plane used by the Royal Air Force and other allies before, during and after the war. And the color scheme is meant to evoke the cockpit of that plane. The white numbers are reminiscent of the instrument clusters, and even little pop of red in the Spitfire signature is also present in the plane's cockpit. I'm gonna skip for a second the Fotina on the hands and around the dial, we'll get back to that. To also mention that this watch was inspired by the design of the IWC Mark 11 navigation watch, which was produced from 1948 onward for the British Royal Air Force. Moving on now, let's talk a little bit more about the case. So as mentioned, this is a stainless steel case. It is 39 millimeters in diameter and 10.8 millimeters thick. 39 millimeter case is awesome. Compared to the Mark 18, which is 40 millimeters, I mean, seems like a millimeter can't really make that much of a difference, but in this case, I have to say that it does. I really prefer how the Spitfire wears on my wrist over the Mark 18. On the side of the case is a screwed on crown. Case back is closed because you've got a soft iron inner case around the movement to protect it from magnetic fields. Not sure if you're gonna need that on a daily basis, but it's a nice little conversation starter. Some people might not like that the case back isn't see-through because the movement is a new in-house IWC movement, but I think, you know, given all the vintage vibes that this watch throws off, it kind of makes sense, even from a design perspective. Speaking of the movement, as I mentioned, it is an all-new in-house automatic movement from IWC, caliber 32110. That comes with a pretty nice 72-hour power reserve also features a silicon escape wheel and lever. The dial, this thing just looks so good. I absolutely love the look and design of the dial. It does what it's supposed to do as a tool watch. It's easy to read. So we've got hour and minute hands, a hacking sweep seconds hand, Arabic numerals, and minute indices around the edge of the dial. We've got the IWC signature, spitfire in red. There is a date window at three o'clock, which I happen to like. you know, date windows can be a touchy subject for some. And if you look even closer, what I really love about this date window is that it's kind of like two tiered. So there's a really neat element of depth there. The dial itself is a matte finish that has a really nice texture to it. Subtle, yeah, but it's there and it's just a really nice touch. Let's talk about the Fotino. I said we would on the hour and minute hands, the triangle above the IWC signature and the 12, 3, 6, and 9 indices. I will say that on some watches, I really hate Fortuna. It's like the watch equivalent of trying really hard to look cool, but not really pulling it off. A lot of vintage tribute watches, I don't like for that reason. Having said that, I think it really works on this watch. It seems seamless, it doesn't seem out of place. I don't feel like this is a watch that's trying to be something that it's not. And it's honestly one of the features that I think makes the Spitfire really stand out compared to the Mark 18. This is a great everyday casual watch. It's so easy to wear. This is the watch that I like to wear when I'm wearing my OCPs. Obviously, very easy to swap out for a different color NATO. So, you know, tons of options in terms of styling. Everyone that's seen this has commented on it. It's a real crowd favorite and I absolutely love this watch. And when you consider that brand new, This watch with the in-house movement costs about the same or a little bit less than some configurations of the Mark 18. I mean, it's just an incredible value. New watch collection video will be coming up soon, hopefully, but as you now know, there have been some changes. Till then, why don't you click over there to see what the collection looked like last time and make some guesses in the comments about what's still there, what's new, and what might be gone."

        "transcript": " So here's the thing. It's very easy to put on a suit and tie and look like an adult But looking like an adult when you dress casually is a completely different story, right? Like how do you take these universal casual staples like jeans t-shirts sweatshirts and make them age Appropriate when they're worn by guys of all ages There are a lot of ways to get this wrong and the worst is being an older guy Looking like he's trying too hard to look younger. So how do you do it? But how do you dress casually and look like an adult? In my experience, there are seven things you need to pay attention to. There are some key principles to follow, and there are some really easy upgrades that you can make. I'm going to share those with you in this video and show you what it looks like. I'm Brian Sakawa. You are watching He Spoke Style, and this channel is dedicated to giving you all the advice and inspiration you need to dress well, develop your personal style, and gain more confidence. Before we get into it, I want to take a quick commercial break to let you know that today's video is sponsored by Keeps. Keeps is a subscription service that focuses on making it easier and more affordable for men to treat their male pattern baldness online. Here is a statistic for you. Two out of three guys experience some form of male pattern baldness by the time they are 35. And the best way to prevent it is to do something about it while you still have hair left. With keeps, a licensed doctor reviews your information online and recommends the right hair loss treatment for you. Then your treatment is shipped directly to your door every three months. Keeps offers generic versions of the FDA approved medications for hair loss, which makes it more affordable. So, if you're ready to take action and prevent hair loss, go to keeps.com slash he spoke style. That link is right down there in the description. on that to receive 50% off your first order. Now the first thing I want you to do is to think about how you used to dress when you were younger, like when you're in high school for example. So for me, what I like to wear a lot of the time were rock band t-shirts, t-shirts with some kind of saying on them, sweatshirts with logos, I had this jean jacket that I used to wear all the time that had pins and patches all over it. And if you think where I'm going with this is to tell you that you shouldn't wear logos or graphic t-shirts or stuff like that, that's not quite what I'm getting at. Yes, I do think that graphic t-shirts, ironic t-shirts and logos, all that stuff make you not look your age if you wear them when you are older. But what I wanna focus on here is that all those things just look really busy. To wear t-shirts and sweatshirts and jackets as an adult and look like an adult, it's best to simplify. So instead of a graphic t-shirt, choose one in a solid color. Instead of a sweatshirt with a big logo on it, go with a classic style without a logo. It's pretty simple and keeping it simple like that is one of the keys to looking good dressed casually as an adult. All right, so the next thing you need to focus on to dress casually as an adult is one of the exact same things that I constantly preach about when it comes to looking good in a suit. Your clothes have to fit. Doesn't matter whether it's dressed up or casual. If your clothes don't fit, you're not gonna look like an adult. You're not going to look like you know how to dress your age. Now one thing I wanna emphasize here with fit is that when it comes to how your clothing should fit that it really depends on two things, the look you're going for and your body type. If you're like me and you consider your style to be classic with a modern sensibility, that tailor fit, you know, slim, comfortable, definitely not tight or form fitting, it's probably what you're looking for. If you're someone who enjoys keeping up with trends here and there, there's nothing that says you can't do that as an older guy, but I would just say don't overdo it. But how do you actually get your clothes to fit the right way? The first thing I would recommend is to find a great tailor, even for casual clothes. A good tailor will be able to make any number of small tweaks, you know, whether that's hemming your pants or jeans, yes, you can do that too, shortening a shirt sleeve, little things that go a long way to helping you do grown up casual right. And if you're wondering how to find a great tailor, check out that video I've got linked right up there. The second thing I'd recommend is to explore a variety of different ready to wear brands. Different brands have different fits. Some will work for you, some won't work for you. Figure out what does, what matches your personal style, and you will be well on your way. So if there's one thing I really want to stress here, it's that there are many different ways to dress casually and look good as an adult. I don't want you to think that I'm saying that you have to dress like me to look good or to look right. We're all different. live in different places, we have different jobs, we have different experiences. I went through this like little crisis maybe six, seven years ago. I used to think that I needed to constantly wear something different, you know, like to keep showing people that I quote unquote knew how to dress. But what happened was, was that I started driving myself nuts. I was getting frustrated, it felt too complicated, and honestly I didn't feel like myself. At that point, I realized what I really like to wear and I got really comfortable with the idea that that was my style. So I stopped driving my behaviors in terms of style based on what I saw other people doing and learned to really like and appreciate what I like to wear. Knowing what you like and sticking to that and developing a sort of uniform for yourself, that's not boring, that's cool. It's what makes you you. It becomes your calling card and it becomes your style. If you apply what I've talked about already, simplifying and paying attention to fit, that's gonna work in a variety of different styles and approaches, but it's most important that you're comfortable because if you're not, that's going to negatively affect how you carry yourself and your confidence. So at that point, it's like all that work would be for nothing. All right, next let's get into some specific upgrades that you can make and starting off with one of the ultimate casual staples, jeans. If your jeans are worn out, full of holes, poorly fitting, meeting either baggy or too long, where they're pooling at your ankles, it is time to upgrade to some jeans that fit right. Now, you might wonder, how many pairs of jeans should you have and what colors should they be? So the first pair you need is a slim and dark pair. This is your workhorse pair of jeans, and it will be one of the most versatile in your entire wardrobe. You can wear them casually and rugged, and they can easily transition into other slightly dressier casual scenarios like a date night or even business casual depending on your workplace. The second pair I recommend is a pair of black jeans. Of course, black jeans have those rock and roll connotations but as you get older, they take on some other properties that I think are beneficial. They're slimming and they're very easy to dress up casually with just a t-shirt and a casual jacket. The third pair I recommend is a light wash pair. They're sporty, great for the weekends and work with a variety of shirts from T-shirts to polos to button ups. And if you're comfortable with it, you can go ahead and add a white pair in, lots of options there, especially in the summertime, but I know that's not gonna be for everyone. Next, let's talk about footwear, specifically sneakers. Now, I like wearing sneakers as much as the next guy, but I'm not gonna be wearing a pair like this outside of the backyard or the gym. Athletic shoes as your go-to footwear outside of working out working around the house are a complete no-go. Instead, upgrade to a pair of minimal low-top leather sneakers. They're still sporty, but help make a casual outfit look a little more put together and considered. I'll talk about and show you some other footwear options later on in the video. As you get older, you look more mature, and your casual dress should also look more mature. An easy way to do this is to upgrade some of those classic casual outerwear pieces that you have in different materials, textures, and colors. So, for example, classic denim jacket. I don't think there's anything wrong with wearing this as an adult, but I will grant you that it does appear more youthful. But the same garment in a light tan corduroy, caramel colored suede, or chocolate suede, has a completely different look and feel. Not only does it look more mature, but it's also more elevated while still being casual. This next upgrade might be a little controversial since we're talking about dressing casually, but I do think it's important as an adult, even when you're dressing casually, to have a go-to sport coat. So our goal is to make a casual outfit look more mature and age-appropriate. And if you think of an outfit as consisting of three main garments, pants, shirt, and some kind of jacket or outer layer, All you need to do to make a casual outfit look more mature is to add a dressier piece, one dressier piece into the mix. And I think a sport coat is one of the easiest ways to do that. Take this outfit, for example, jeans, t-shirt, hoodie. Swap out the hoodie for a navy sport coat, and I don't even have to tell you because you can clearly see the difference that just one small change made to the entire look and feel of this outfit. So we've talked about a few general things you can do as well as some specific upgrades you can make, but instead of just talking about it, what I want to do next is to show you what these things look like in practice. Five looks for various seasons coming your way. Let's jump right into it. So this look here is like the clearest illustration of pretty much everything I've talked about. Two real simple casual pieces, light gray sweatshirt, light wash jeans, classic sporty combo. Over that, I've got a lightweight navy suede jacket from a brand called Valstar. You know, for a sporty look like this, I think a crop jacket works really well and the darker color complements and completes the look. Some simple two-tone sneakers, these are from Suitsupply. Again, kind of sporty with a contrast between the taupe of the leather and the white sole. On my wrist, I'm wearing the Longine Heritage Classic Sector Dial and a classic pair of Ray-Ban Clubmasters to finish everything off. Here we've got a classic kind of rock and roll look, black t-shirt, black jeans. Skys the limit when it comes to what to style with this. I kept it simple but with some pretty big contrasts. Starting with the jacket, it's a classic trucker jacket style but in a gorgeous caramel color and buttery smooth suede. Both the color and the texture elevate the look and really make it stand out. More contrast to anchor the outfit with some white common project sneakers. I'm a fan of the white against black for me. I think it just creates more visual interest and kind of like a visual layering. On my wrist, got the Speedy on a black NATO, and then keeping the rock and roll vibes here with some Jacques Marie-Maz shades. All right, next we've got a summertime look to illustrate that casual doesn't always mean jeans, especially in the summer, you know, when you're not really gonna want to wear jeans. Very easy to substitute a pair of khaki cotton pants. Going with a simple brown gingham button-up shirt here, both the shirt and the pants are from our collection, available in the shop. And I mean, it's a real simple combination. What really takes it up a notch and completes it are the footwear and accessories. Got a suede tassel loafer. Again, suede always feels more mature to me. Suede belt to match. Panama hat makes the silhouette more complete and the watch and sunglasses just finish everything off. Here we've got a jeans and sport coat look. Foundation is just really simple tan crew neck sweater paired with some slim dark denim. On its own, casual, it's fine, but you can really elevate it and make it more grown up with the addition of a sport coat. I love this particular jacket with this look. It's a clean and simple color palette with the browns up top, the blue jeans, and white sneakers. If you come in closer to the jacket, you can see there's a nice texture to it, makes it more interesting. And again, like suede, definitely appears more mature than a regular old solid color jacket. Watch is the Vacheron traditionale. Sunglasses are the Dylan by Jacques-Marie Maj. Now you can easily wear a nice pair of walnut derbies if you wanted to dress this up a bit, but to keep it more casual and sporty, I like the white sneakers. Now there's summer look here substituting jeans for some cream colored cotton pants, which I'm pairing with a black polo shirt. Very simple combo, very high contrast. Polo shirt, classic casual piece, but this particular shirt from our collection feels more elevated and grown up for two specific reasons. It's got a stronger collar, so keeps it shape better, easier to wear under a sport coat if you want to do that. And it's got a five button placket rather than the standard three button. I deliberately did not wear a belt with this to keep it looking very simple and clean. Got a white baseball cap with this along with some white sneakers to create some balance top to bottom. Great sporting watch, the IWC Spitfire on my wrist and finished off again with the Ray Band Club Masters. So if there's one thing I really want you to take away from this video, it's the power of simplicity. Your goal shouldn't be to have lots of clothes. It should be to have less clothing that you can do more with. And the capsule wardrobe concept is a great way to get started.

        "transcript": " Still gonna say it again though. I am severely underdressed for this, but that's what we have So it's been a while since we've done a Q&A and a lot of you love seeing Robin on the channel So here she is there's been a lot that's gone on since the last time we've done this. We're actually in a new house This is our bedroom. So Yes, welcome So we've got actually 11 questions for you guys today. So we're just gonna jump right in so the first question is Someone asked just got engaged Congratulations, first of all. Any marriage advice? Well, if you just got engaged, I would say to enjoy the engagement. Everyone around you was rushing Wednesday day. When are you getting married? What are you doing? Like 20,000 questions and I feel like people rush that they need to get married right away. So first step, enjoy the engagement as much as possible, right? Get a wedding planner to help if you're doing a bigger wedding. Right. That's wedding. I think we covered that in a previous one. Maybe we'll link that up there. Yes. But that's like they just got engaged. So that's just like that helps the engagement process which makes for a happier marriage. Okay. Now when they are married, yes, like us, we've been married for a while now. Almost five years. now. I would say my advice to you is to listen and communicate. I am not a great... Hey, I'm learning. I just took a Myers-Briggs test and I am an INTJ, so I prefer to keep to myself. I keep things in. I'm not a big communicator, but you are. Well, I might be an over communicator. So I think there is the balance of being patient with each other and finding even if it's not the same communication styles trying, we're still working through it for us. This is going to be like a therapy session. I think so. It feels like it. Tough first question. But yeah, find a way to always communicate not to hold on to things. Don't hold grudges. We don't hold grudges on anything. We don't because we communicate even if we don't really resolve everything. We're not like, well, six months ago you said X, Y, and Z and I'm still mad at it. Like that's not a part of it, right? Yeah. I'm still trying to communicate with her about painting the walls white downstairs, but anyway, next question. Okay, so a lot of you know that we've moved recently. This is a new place for us. And one of the questions we had was, are there any new essential home things that you like? And I swear this was not a plant, but this is a really great segue into letting you guys know that this video is sponsored by Bull and Branch. They make some amazing bedding. Actually, everything on here right now is Bull and Branch. A lot of people don't think to invest in like quality bedding like this, but I don't know. We actually, we love it. We didn't until like two years ago either. Right, yeah. I mean, it's not, it isn't something that you think to invest in, but I swear like once you do and you feel how it feels like, you know, it's like an important part of your day. And starts your day, ends your day. Yeah. And investing in like a quality product that is made well. It feels good. It's comfortable. Your wife partner can get the fitted sheet on the mattress without breaking their nails and dislocating a shoulder. Yeah, that's right. The fitted sheets on other things, they just never fit this mattress. And for some reason like this, I just put it right on, through the pillow, zipper sham, just through that in. I don't have to shake the pillow and shove it in there. The other thing I think just like close to, if you invest in quality linens like this and bedding, as you wash it, it actually gets better. It feels better the more you wash it. And linen sheets, we never had them until last year. And I could not believe how much cooler the bed actually was. Oh yeah, yeah, it's getting warmer now. Yeah, so we have pillowcases, we have pillow shams, we have a quilted comforter, a waffle blanket, and you like the waffle blanket for? This throws me back to childhood. I feel like everyone had the white waffle blanket. this feels like it's the same blanket but it has a little bit more texture and design to it. Yeah, there's the adult version. We absolutely love this stuff and definitely would recommend it to you and if you go to their website they have a lot more than just what we've showed you which showed you. They have a lot more than we've just shown you. Thanks again to Bollin Branch for sponsoring this video. Living in a different country if so where? Italy. Yeah, Italy. Where in Italy though? Let's drill down. We've tried We've traveled a lot to Italy. We've been to Florence, Milan, and Venice. And Lake Como. So where would you want to live? I don't know. I've never been to the south of Italy. I don't know that it really matters. If you're in like Tuscany or something and you're just enjoying the surroundings, I don't have, I can't say where. but it would definitely be somewhere in Italy. Yes, agreed. All right, next question here is, do you guys help each other buy clothing or tell each other what to do regarding clothing? I would say, I never tell you what to wear or what to buy. I might ask you for an opinion if I'm going to buy something and I'm on the edge about it or if it's an investment. I think I might ask you not for permission, but like, do you like it? Is this, what do you think? Feel like you do the same. Yeah, now see the issue becomes when one of us buys something and then we put it on and then go to show the other person. Maybe this falls into the any marriage advice question. So if your partner puts on something new, See, what I have trouble with is like, you know, she has great taste. And, you know, she doesn't need me to say like, oh, you should get this or you should, there are certain things that I like, but, you know, and she shows me something, sometimes like I can see in her face that she's not sure about it. Or like, and I'm constantly wondering like, do you need me to, like, do you want me to read your mind? Or do you want me to just tell you, like, it looks good? Yeah, but sometimes I'm honest and you're like, oh. Like yesterday with the gold boots. Yeah. It's all keeping them though. Okay, should show them the gold boots. Let's mark that down. It's been a while since we've been out and shopped together. Yeah, we don't shop together. It's more of like, I just show him, I bought this, I'm going to buy this, more online shopping. So it's maybe like the before or after. Like I got this, what do you think? So when you show me something, Like, do you want me to say? That I look very pretty? I always say that. I want you to be honest, that's why I'm asking. Okay, but sometimes I am honest and... And I'll make a decision on whether that matters or not. Okay, there you have it. All right, here's a good one here. What's the best way to deal with conflict with your married partner? What do you think? always agree with your wife? Yes, that's always a... That doesn't happen here. I mean, but seriously folks, I think talking about it and being open and again, like having that line of communication is really good just so you know how they know how you feel, you know how they feel and then you can take it from there but you have to like establish like that baseline. So you know where both of you are coming from. Next question is, were you both always interested in fashion? Depends on how far back. Yes and no, I was a tomboy growing up and then in high school, I started to play with clothing a little bit more because I couldn't afford everything. So I would like treasure hunt in the like sales racks and the clearance racks to try and put things together. and I found a new creative outlet for myself. So maybe like since 16, but prior to that, I was a dirt ball, not dirt ball, like dirt, just always dirty playing. I didn't care about what I was wearing. It was just like utility. And then I kind of found a groove. I mean, I feel like I've answered this question a lot before. I've always been conscious of it. My father always dressed really well. He always either wore a suit and a tie or like a sport coat. So that I always saw that. And then of course, you know, it sounds like so cliche, you know, but like really like the original James Bond movies were very influential on me as a as a kid. My father watched those with me. So, and, you know, I was always interested in it. I always knew like how it had a power to sort of like influence how you felt and also influence how people see you. But it really wasn't until later in life when I started actually investing the time in it. So, but it's always been there, but it's only been maybe the last 15 years or so where I've put like a lot of thought into it. Post the Caesar haircut that you had in your 20s. Caesar haircut. Yeah, you had that little like in sync backstreet boy. Yeah. Caesar haircut. Okay. What do you two do as a couple for fun beyond travel? I feel like we haven't traveled that much. Not in three years. No. So yeah, what have we done for fun since then? Nothing. Ha ha ha. Watching shows on Hulu or Netflix or HBO. I mean, that sounds so lame, but like it's like a thing that we do. Oh, you know what else we do? We watch a Jeopardy in Wheel of Fortune. I'm not kidding. I'm gonna be 45. She's turning. Don't, don't say that. I mean, well, we started doing like weekly date nights. Yes, yeah, recently. We started doing like just going to a bar at a restaurant and sitting or making reservation at like the early bird time and going in before it gets too crowded. But well, now that with the new house, we actually have a backyard, we have a garden, we have a little like patio area. So we have been even just hanging outside not watching TV that is kind of like mind-numbing? Yeah, a lot of projects around the house. Outside and side. The dog obviously takes up a lot of our time. Yes. But yeah, it's nice to have our space now and really, we've done a lot when we think about it, moving into the house nine months ago. Yeah, it's crazy. There was a question, will we be getting a house tour? You know, and like- I know and like even in the last house it was like, you know, we just wanted to finish that one thing and then we would do it but Then we moved. Yeah, and then we moved so you never got to see the old house So maybe I mean We could do it in parts. Yeah, we keep instead of waiting for like a full reveal Why don't we do because the upstairs is gonna take a long time to Get it to where we want like we like the bedroom. We don't like the bathroom so we can do like main floor Or we can show them your studio and then we'll eventually do a true before and after. Almost there with the studio. Almost there. So soon. Soon. Yeah. Part one and two. Okay. Next question here. Are you guys planning on having children? No. No? No. And I know some people might wonder why. I've never wanted them. My dreams growing up. I never envisioned another person in my life. But I found him. I never pictured like this like romantic wedding, a lot of little girls like grow up and dream about those things. My focus was always career and yeah, just like having a certain feeling and validation coming through career. I've always wanted animals. I've always wanted these other things, but that just wasn't something that was innately like natural for me. So yeah, I think a lot of people might hear you say like, oh, I was always into my career. And that, I mean, no, well that, that like, I think conjures like a certain image of like, you know, but like a really cold, like driven, like don't care. So yeah, but you are like anything but that. Like you care so much about people and family. So it's- I love my friends, kids. I love my nephews. I'm a great aunt to my nephews, but I also know myself and I would, Sean Hayes says this on his podcast all the time, but so to quote him, I'd rather regret not having one day than regret having. And that was one thing when we met, when you said you didn't wanna have kids, it was kind of a weight off my shoulders because dating apps and everything before that, it's like, do I want kids? I don't know, I have to answer this question. Well, then what about religion? Do I care about religion? were all these questions that I felt kind of an authentic answering. And then when you said you don't want kids, I was like, then when you said you don't want a dog, I was like, I got to break up with this guy. Well, that's where I was gonna go with it. That's where I was gonna go with this. We do have a German Shepherd, which is... Our child. Yeah, but it's a lot. I don't... I can barely manage that, so I don't... Yeah, it's not for us. We know ourselves for ever. We know how much work it takes it's just not in our future. Yeah. But what might be in our future, the next question, will you guys get another cat or dog? No. Yes. Not a cat or a dog. Two cats. We're going to Rob's lovely wife and daughter are fostering kittens and we're going to get two kittens this week that one of us is more excited about than the other. But their names will be Nick and Nora. Yes. See that's how she sold it to me. I did. Let's just name them after thin man characters. Yeah I'll probably I'll probably love them. I hope Coco loves them too. Yeah we did try and adopt a we tried to rescue a dog earlier in the year and Coco's health is not totally stable so it wasn't the right time so that was kind of a failed adoption unfortunately but I think the kittens might be a little bit easier for her not as like it's not gonna be like hopefully WrestleMania in the house so fingers crossed that you see Nick and Nora on your house tour. Yeah and next year's Christmas card. Okay moving on now does Robin have a watch collection and there was actually a question that I left out that sort of played into this but someone asked, do you let Robin borrow your reversal? I would like to borrow your Rolex, maybe. I like the Rolex. Okay. That's more like me. But see, okay. I have a collection of two watches, the J.J.R. I have this that I wear more than I actually thought. I'm not really a watch person because I have a small wrist and the watches just never looked right on me. That's a small. So yeah, I like the small or like oversized men's watch. like your watch and my great grandfather's Omega Seamaster that I wear. It doesn't run as well. So I actually wear this when I want actual time, but I just have the two. Now I got my Reverso engraved. Yes. With quote from the thin man. Aren't you gonna get yours? I don't know what I want yet. I have commitment issues and that has not been figured out yet. You have commitment issues? Mm-hmm. You still. Didn't know about that. Okay. Okay. So that's actually a good place to end, I think. That's it? That's it. That's it. But what I'm curious about is what people think, what people, our viewers think that you should get on your, the back of your, what should you get engraved in your reverse out? Well, that's not keep it too open-ended. Maybe like, should it be? Just some suggestions. Sentimental. Right. It could be a quote, it could be a monogram, it can be a picture, can it be a picture of something like an etch? I don't know. I mean, it probably could. Yeah, I feel like they can like sketch. The only thing you can't get on that is enamel. Yeah, but you can get like a sketching of like Coco's face if I wanted to, her name. That's what I'm not sure about, is it like a quote, is it someone's initials, is it a date? I'm not sure what to put on there. Anyway, help us out, okay? So anyway, wanna thank Bolin Branch once again for sponsoring today's video. And you can see the lovely bidding that we have from Bolin Branch back there one more time. So again, thanks again. And we'll be back here another time. And I'm terrible at finishing these up. That's it. And that's it. Coco! Yes, mommy daddy. Careful, Coco, come here. Oh, it's a big dog! Come on! Coco, come here. Hi! What do you think of the bed? What do you think of the bed? Let me kiss you. Coco, are you a good dog? Are you gonna... I think it's time to go."

        "transcript": " Here are five signs that you are stuck in a rut. Every day seems the same and you can't even remember what day of the week it is. You don't feel excited or inspired by anything. You're unmotivated. You feel unfulfilled. You want to make a change but you're worried that it's going to be too hard to do and you think you know you're just better off doing the same thing that you've always done. If that stuff resonates with you, the first thing you need to do is to not feel bad about it because we all go through periods like that throughout our lives. Now, it might feel never ending and like there's no way to get out of it, but you will. And if you use the 10 tips in this video, I guarantee you'll get there faster. I'm Brian Sakawa. You are watching He Spoke Style, and this channel is dedicated to giving you all the advice and inspiration you need to dress well, develop your personal style, and gain more confidence. Tip number one, very simple. You've got to accept the situation. Hey, I'm in a rut. I get it. I accept it. Now, let's figure out how to get out of it. For tip number two, I actually want to go back to one thing I mentioned in the intro, and that is, don't feel bad if you find yourself in a rut. If you're feeling this way, the thoughts that come to mind might be like, well, you know, when I look at myself objectively, I've got a pretty good life, which then might make you think, I shouldn't be feeling this way. Almost like you don't have a right to feel the way you feel. But you do have a right to feel this way. You feel how you feel for a reason. And if you're telling yourself you shouldn't feel this way, you're not going to make any progress. So what you need to do is to let go of that and really try to understand and get to the bottom of what is causing you to feel like you're in a rut. Identify the cause. Is it your romantic relationship? Is it your health? Is it your job? Your family situation? Your friendships? Your hobbies? figure this out because you need to know where to direct your energy. The next thing you want to do, tip number three, is to analyze your goals. And specifically, what we want to do is to kind of put things in perspective. You need to be honest with yourself about what it is you're hoping to achieve and whether that goal is reasonable. Personal example I use and that I've used before is, let's say my goal is to be a professional basketball player. So let's step back and analyze that for a second. Well, I'm 5 feet 9 inches tall. I'm almost 45 years old, and I'm not really that great at basketball, even if I practice. So my goal of being a professional basketball player is completely unreasonable. So instead of aiming to be a pro, I've got this basketball hoop my driveway that I wanna use. I'm gonna try to be really good at shooting free throws, and 10 and 15 footers. It's actually something I can achieve. It's more attainable. And that is what we're talking about here in terms of analyzing your goals and putting things in perspective. It's okay to dream big, but if you're dreaming too big and not being honest about what you can reasonably achieve, you're gonna keep dooming yourself to failure. Now, don't equate recalibrating your goals downward to failure or that you don't have potential. What you need to do in the short term is to create conditions that will promote success. Through those small successes, you're gonna gain some momentum, and that momentum will continue to carry you up, up, up, and up out of your rut and perhaps even get you closer to that bigger goal that you had originally. So once you've accepted that your inner rut identified the cause and figured out where you want to go, one of the things you might be tempted to do is to completely change up your routine. When you're inner rut, you feel like you're doing the same thing over and over and over and over again. But it makes complete sense to think that making some really big changes to that routine is the key to getting out of the funk that you're in. In theory, it sounds great, but actually that is the wrong way to approach it. Because if you make a lot of drastic changes at the same time to either habits or behaviors, that actually is going to very quickly create a lot more stress and anxiety for you and you'll feel overwhelmed and probably won't be able to commit to any of those changes. Now that doesn't mean you shouldn't change up your routine, but what you should do is to make small changes to that routine. Choose one or two things and make those changes manageable. You want to be able to follow through with whatever change you make. One particular routine that I think is perfect to get into for this kind of situation when you're in a rut is a skin care routine. It checks a lot of boxes. It's a small change that makes a big impact on how you feel and see yourself. It's good for you, both short and long term. It's very easy to get into and it is manageable. I know that skin care can sometimes seem like a challenge to get into. There's like so many different products. You're not sure what you should be using. Everything always runs out at different times and it's hard to keep everything stocked. And that is why I personally love and recommend Teesh Handley, who I'm proud to partner with for today's video because they make the whole thing just super easy. If Teesh is new to you, they have many different products, but all you really need to get started is their basic plan which includes a face cleanser, an exfoliating scrub, an AM moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun, and PM moisturizer for the important repair process that happens while you sleep. Older guys like me, I'd recommend bumping up to Teej's level 3 system and that is going to add in a firming serum and an eye cream. I've used this stuff every day and every night for the past year and a half and I can definitely tell you that I see and feel a difference. So let's get back to the part where I said it's easy. So when you get your box in the mail and open it up, it comes with a card. That card tells you what to do, when to do it, and how much of the product to use. And it gets even simpler because when you subscribe, you don't even have to think about going out to get more when you run out because it automatically comes to your door every month. Now in addition to great skin, when you join Tees, you get lots of perks as well, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, you can pause and cancel at any time, there are no hassle refunds, and there's free US shipping as well as low cost shipping to most other countries. And because TeachHandley is sponsoring today's video, they're offering you guys a great deal, all you gotta do is click the first link in the description and you'll get TeachHandley for 30% off, and you can also choose a Dopp Kit, Hand Towel or Body Wash and Scrubber Combo as a free gift. So click that link to get started today. Since we're on the topic of taking care of yourself, for tip number five, what I want you to do is to think about self-care. Are you taking care of yourself? Like yourself, your actual self. Now, if you hear the term self-care and you're like, man, that's too Oprah. That's not me. I'm a man. I don't need to do that. Well, you do. You won't believe it until you try it, but trust me, it works. So what are some self-care things that you can do? and don't think about anything. Nothing. Nothing at all. Download a meditation app and try one of the guided meditations. If you're working on something, take a break. If you're feeling burnt out, take a step back. Exercise. Spend time with people you love. Make sure you're eating well and make sure you're getting plenty of sleep. Oh, this next one, tip number six. It's tough. Of all the strategies I'm giving you in this video. This one will be the hardest for certain people because it deals with something that can often lead people to great success. And if you're this type of person you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If you are a perfectionist let go of that and as a perfectionist myself I know that that's difficult to do. You have high standards. You set high expectations for yourself and if you don't meet them you might tend to be a little hard on yourself. And you know even if you do meet those expectations, you might immediately start thinking, well, how could I have done that even better? This is a vicious cycle of sabotage when you are in a rut. So instead of focusing on perfection and putting so much weight on that, turn that focus to just getting things done and putting forth your best effort. It doesn't have to be perfect. Just do things to the best of your ability because if you're a perfectionist, the best of your ability or even if you're not trying so hard is generally going to be a much higher standard than what the average person actually considers to be really great. So it's okay to not be perfect. Now for tip number seven, this is one that sometimes gets a bad rap for potentially being reckless and risky. But there are two specific ways that being impulsive can benefit you if you find yourself in a rut. You know, when you're in a rut, it kind of has the effect of taking some of your confidence away. ahead and make a quick decision about something and stick to that decision, that will actually increase your confidence in your ability to get something done. And second, if you approach something in a new way, in a way that's more impulsive, meaning less thought going into it, it's going to give you a different perspective. It's going to give you some new insights. And looking at something differently is a great way to get yourself out of a rut. Now remember that being impulsive doesn't mean being reckless. So instead of saying, you know what, I'm going to be a bass jumper starting tomorrow. Dial it back a little and maybe say yes to a date. Sign up for a cooking class. Visit someplace nearby you've never been before and don't make a plan before you go. Tip number eight is to go outside. Go for a walk. Go for a bike ride. Go for a jog. Go to the park. Do something outside and I guarantee you'll come back inspired. Tip number nine, let's talk about routines again because a routine is a good thing. But if you don't switch it up, things can get boring. And not only that, but what this does to your brain, well, what your brain does is, it's used to this pattern. So it keeps applying the same strategies and processes to the problem. But that's not working. That's why you're in a rut. So what you need to do is to reset your brain. Start by not thinking. Let your mind wander. Again, tip number eight, go outside. Sit quietly. Doodle. Nap. Watch some bad TV. to just get your mind off of and away from this rut thing. Now finally, tip number 10 is to realize that sometimes a rut isn't just a rut. It could be something else, something like depression. A rut is temporary and you'll eventually get out of it, but depression is something more serious and I would definitely get some support and get some help if you think you might be depressed. There's no shame in that. Having someone to talk to outside of your family friends is really helpful and I know that because I've personally done talk therapy in the past. It's extremely helpful to just unload everything and one thing you got to know though is it's not like a quick thing where you do it just a handful of times and you're better. It's a process and like everything it takes work and commitment but it is so worth it. I think this is such an important topic and really want to thank TeachHandley for sponsoring this video and giving me this platform to put this information out there to you guys. So just a reminder, click the first link in the description and you'll get 30% off-teach Hanley and you'll also be able to choose a Dopp Kit, Hand Towel, or Body Wash and Scrubber Combo as a free gift with your first box."

        "transcript": " You know what? It's been a long time since I've done a good old-fashioned outfit video on the channel. And you know what else? I think it's time to do one. We've got this new space here and I've got a rack of clothes as well as some shoes and accessories to put together five spring outfits. But first, you know what happens. I'm Brian Sakawa. You are watching He Spoke Style and this channel is dedicated to giving you all the advice and inspiration you need to dress well, develop your personal style and gain more confidence. Here we are with look number one, which features a pair of white denim from J Crew in my favorite 484 fit. Up top, I've got a cream textured sweater with gray stripes from Peter Millar. And then over that I'm layering this amazing Olive Safari jacket, which was a collaboration between Informale and Craftsman clothing. I know that combining a sweater and jacket might seem a little too much for spring, especially since we're getting closer to summer now, but both of these pieces are very lightweight and also made with linen. The jacket 100% linen and the sweater is actually about a 50-50 mix of Merino wool and linen. Shoes and accessories. I'm wearing a pair of Bowden and Lang loafers, suede belt to match. Sunglasses are the Dylan by Jacques-Marie Maj. And on my wrist, the datagraph is the perfect finishing touch here. Earth tones like olive and brown, you know, we typically think of being fall colors, but When you style them with light tones like white and cream, they're very easy to integrate into your spring and summer wardrobe. Look number two, I'm going to call business casually relaxed and sporty slash rugged. So we've got a pair of navy cotton trousers paired with denim shirt up top for a nice sporty contrast. And then over that instead of a sport coat, I am layering this khaki cotton Shacket to give it a more rugged and relaxed feel. And all three items, the Shacket shirt and pants are HSS MAB, available in the shop. Anchoring this look are walnut colored Derbies by Enzo Bonafé and for the watch, I decided to go with the beautiful and minimal tradition. The briefcase I've got here is by a company called Maverick & Co. who was kind enough to sponsor today's video. This is the Manhattan Briefcase and it's got a very slim and simple profile. It's made with sapphiana leather which means it's more resistant to scratching and water damage and it's also very durable and easy to clean. It's got a very sporty look with the navy color and orange accents which I think complements this outfit really well. They do have six different color combinations which you can check out on their website. The outside pocket here is perfect for a phone and inside you have a padded laptop sleeve, a medium sized pocket with a magnetic closure, two smaller pockets as well as two pen slots. And if you want they do include a shoulder strap for carrying as well. This is a very understated and classy briefcase for a business casual environment. I think it works extremely well. I've got a link down below to the collection and you can actually save an extra 10% on all Maverick and Co. products by using code K-HSS10 at checkout. Okay look number three now, bringing back the white denim and pairing it with a little bit of a darker denim shirt than you saw in the previous look. Over that I've got our classic navy blazer and some suede tassel loafers anchoring the outfit. Spring-summer, I love doing this preppy nautical style, feels fresh and really kind of matches the season. Obviously a key part to this look is a pair of white pants and for a more everyday easy wearing relaxed look I do prefer white jeans because they're more casual but if it was a date night situation I would definitely swap them out for a nice pair of white cotton pants instead. Now if the day or evening is a little chillier check this out. I think the Olive Linden Safari jacket from Look 1 is a great piece to layer. You get a little more depth and interest in terms of color. I do really like how the green complements the brown of the loafers and it also lends a more casually rugged overall feel. Moving on to look number four and this one's maybe a little more towards summer but would definitely work on a warm spring day. Featured piece here is this navy short sleeve pajama shirt which I paired with some cream linen trousers both from the HSS MAB collection. Don't sleep on the pajama shirt as a cool, relaxed, and unexpected spring-summer top. I don't know about you, but as much as I love classic style, over the last couple years, you know, I've really enjoyed adding some more casual and different kinds of pieces into my wardrobe. And for me, the pajama shirt kind of represents a good feeling and kind of a reminder to enjoy yourself and be as relaxed as you would be when you might typically be wearing some pajamas. So for shoes, I kept it casual but elevated with the Bowden and Lang loafers, datagraph once again on my wrist. And then now help me decide here whether you prefer this outfit with these sunglasses or with this hat. Let me know in the comments. For look number five, going super casual and relaxed with the denim on denim look, the light blue denim shirt is by drakes which I paired with some kind of medium blue jeans from J Crew in 484 fit. Over that I've thrown on a tan corduroy trucker jacket kind of a more unique and maybe I'd say grown-up take on a very cool and classic piece of lightweight outerwear. Shoes I've got on a pair of white leather common project sneakers. Sunglasses are the Fitzgerald by Jacques-Marie Maj and on the wrist I have my Omega Speedmaster on a mesh band from Forstner Vans. I think this is definitely an outfit that anyone can pull off, but if it happens to be, you know, maybe a little too casual for you, go ahead and check out that playlist right over there, which is full of over 50 different outfit ideas that are both simple and stylish."

        "transcript": " All right, so when it comes to dress codes, especially when we're talking about black tie or anything related to formal wear, I understand that it can seem very prescriptive and like there's not much room to put your own personal signature on things. Now there are ways to do this and in this video, I'm going to take you through five specific recommendations I have for how to add a little personality to your wedding outfit, whether it's a tuxedo or suit, formal or casual, or anything in between. One thing I will say, however, before jumping into my five recommendations, is that any personal touch you add should be on the subtle side of things. You do not want anything that is going to call a lot of attention to itself, because the focus at your wedding should be on you and your spouse, specifically your spouse, and you do not want any detail, whether it's clothing or an accessory, to take away from that. The thing that should stick in people's minds should be how great your wedding was, not that crazy bow tie that you wore. So now that that's out of the way, let's jump into my five ways to add a personal touch to your wedding outfit. Personal touch number one are cuff links. If you're wearing a French cuff shirt, you're going to wear cuff links. And cuff links are hands down one of the best ways to add some personality to your outfit. This is a great opportunity if you have a specific interest passion to display that in a subtle way. Another recommendation I have with cufflinks is to get them engraved. You can have your initials, your bride's initials, your wedding date, anything that is special to you. The thing I really like about this approach is not only is it adding something personal to your outfit on your wedding day, but it's also something that you'll have for the rest of your life as a memory of that day. And you know, later on for an anniversary dinner or a special event, you can wear them and they will continue to have meaning to you. Personal touch number two is to add a sentimental item. Now maybe you have a watch that your grandfather gave you or a tie bar or tie tack or cuff links maybe from your father. My wife actually on our wedding day did a really great job of this. She wore the wedding ring of one of her favorite aunts who had passed away. She wore her grandma's ring too and diamond earrings that her parents had given her. I love this approach because it adds just a wonderful layer of extra meaning. Another thing you might consider is to borrow something special from a family member or someone very close to you. Weddings are supposed to have something borrowed, right? Again, it's a very special and meaningful personal touch and I'm sure it would mean a lot to the person you borrowed it from to know that they have this special part in your wedding. Personal touch number three is a pocket square. I know a pocket square might not sound very personal, but there are ways that you can make it more personal. If you search online, there are companies out there that can embroider things on pocket squares. You could have your wedding date again, your name and your bride's name, a favorite quote, something sentimental. Again, my wife did a really great job of this and she got one of these pocket squares for her dad with something really special written on it for him to wear on that day. If you do like a pocket square like this, it's not a detail that people are necessarily going to see, but it's a great way to create something special with a very personal meaning. Personal touch number four is to get a custom suit or tuxedo. If it is within your budget, a custom suit or tuxedo is something I definitely recommend for a wide variety of reasons. And later on in the course, I'm going to cover all of those in detail. for this specific video, what I want to focus on is, of course, the ways in which you can add personal touches to your custom suit or tuxedo. On its own, the suit or tuxedo will be a personal touch, since it's made specifically for you. And if you're doing something custom like this, you have a lot of control over things like colors, buttons, monogramming, and linings. And those last two, the monogram and the lining are places where you really have an opportunity to do something that has a special meaning to you. Personal touch Number five is fragrance. I always say that fragrance is the final detail of any outfit and I like it because of the power that fragrance has to evoke something. It could be a specific time and place, a specific memory, maybe your spouse has a fragrance that she loves when you wear it and if that's the case, make sure you wear that fragrance on your wedding day. You know, and maybe you already have a signature fragrance that you like and you wear all the time or maybe you're looking for something different, something special to really tie into how special the day is. If that's the case, if you are looking for something different and need some recommendations, in the next couple of videos, I'm gonna suggest 14 specific fragrances that you might consider. So keep watching, and if you have any questions, let me know."

        "transcript": " All right, so after you've decided what to wear and figured out all your accessories, there is one last detail to consider, which I like to call the final detail of any outfit, and that is a fragrance. Now you may already have a particular fragrance that you like to wear and that your future spouse likes as well, which is honestly one of the most important things. But if you're looking for a fragrance to complement your wedding outfit, I've put together seven recommendations for you. This video deals specifically with spring and summer fragrances so if you're getting married in the fall or winter feel free to skip ahead to the next video. All seven fragrances I'm going to go over here work for a spring or summer wedding for two specific reasons. Reason number one, they're light so they're not going to be overwhelming or unbearable in the heat and reason number two, they're crisp which complements the season and and gives them an overall masculine scent. Fragrance number one is O'Sauvage by Christian Dior, not to be confused with Sauvage, which is a newer fragrance. O'Sauvage is the original, it's an absolute classic, and it is one of the most iconic men's fragrances of all time. Top notes include lemon, bergamot, basil, and lavender. Heart notes, jasmine, rose, carnation, patchouli, and sandalwood. and base notes of Okmas, Vettiver, Musk, and Amber. Overall, this is a very fresh and citrusy fragrance. It also lasts quite a while, five to eight hours, which is not typical of a citrus fragrance. If you're looking for something fresh, simple, and classic, that gets tons of compliments, au savage is a great choice. Fragrance number two is Floris number 89, and this is considered a woody citrus fragrance. Top notes are Bergamot, Lavender, Neuroly, Nutmeg, Orange, and Petite Grain. Heart notes, Geranium, Rose, and Ylang Ylang. And base notes are Cedarwood, Musk, Oak Moss, Sandalwood, and Vettiver. Flores number 89 is considered a quintessential English gentleman's fragrance. To that point, it was supposedly a favorite of Winston Churchill and also Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels. Definitely has that classic gentleman kind of scent, almost like a barber shop fragrance, in that you do get a lot of sharpness from the lavender. Overall, it's very fresh and masculine. You'll get a good four to six hours out of it. And since you typically don't see it in US stores, it's also a bit unique. Fragrance number three is Gerlon Vettiver, which is also considered one of the all-time classic men's fragrances. Vettiver is a type of grass that's native to India, And as a result, vetiver fragrances have a very fresh and grassy smell to them. Gerlon vetiver has top notes of bergamot, lemon, neroli, and coriander. Heart notes are vetiver and cedar. And base notes, tobacco, nutmeg, pepper, and tonka bean. Although you get that underlying grassy vetiver essence, it's not as front and center as many other vetiver fragrances out there. And what you get in addition to the freshness is a sharpness and woodsy-ness that makes Gerlon Vettiver more recognizably masculine than many other Vettiver fragrances. This one lasts quite a bit as well. You'll get six to eight hours out of it. It's another simple, classic, and distinctive scent. Fragrance number four is Ood Fleur by Tom Ford. This is going to be the most unique and distinctive of the seven fragrances I talk about here. Not gonna bother listing off the individual notes of this one because there are way too many to mention, but there are three that really jump out at you. First and foremost is rose. And I know that might not sound like a very masculine scent, but you also have ood and incense, which gives the fragrance a very spicy and masculine quality. This fragrance has a very big projection. It'll last a solid six to eight hours. It's classy, it's elegant, it's unique, it's surprising, and it's very sexy. Fragrance number five is Elysium by Raja Parfum. This is considered an aromatic fougere, which means it's fresh, light, bright, and masculine. It's got top notes that include grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, lime, and thyme. Heart notes of vetiver, juniper, apple, cedar, pink pepper, and jasmine. And base notes include ambergris, vanilla, leather, and benzoin. This fragrance is fresh and it has a little bit of a zing to it. What really comes through are the sharper and more herbaceous notes of grapefruit and juniper. And what really distinguishes this, especially as a light and fresh fragrance, is that it does last very long on the skin thanks to the ambergris. Elysium is a very unique fragrance in this category and it also gets tons of compliments. Fragrance number six is L by Arquist. This is classified as an amber fougere which means it's fresh and herbaceous but also has a very deep rich and masculine scent. Top notes include laurel leaves, clary sage, rosemary, and geranium. Heart notes of cardamom, cinnamon, orange flower water, and buckwheat honey. Bass notes include patchouli, oak moss, vettiver, and a fougere accord. Of the seven fragrances I'm recommending here, L is by far the sexiest of the bunch. However, because this is a deeper and richer scent, I would only recommend wearing it if you are doing something in the evening for your spring or summer wedding. Fragrance number seven is Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford. This is classified as a citrusy aromatic and you have top notes of bergamot, mandarin orange, lemon, bitter orange, lavender and rosemary. Heart notes are African orange flower, neroli and jasmine. And base notes include amber, angelica and ambrette. It's a very light citrusy fragrance and what comes through the most as you might expect from the name is the neroli. Neroli is an oil that is derived from the orange flower blossom so you do get a touch of the floral which also kind of smooths out some of the citrus nodes. This is extremely long lasting. You will easily get eight hours out of this. It's very light. It's very fresh. And if I was doing a beach or seaside wedding, this would definitely be my choice. So there you have it. Those are seven fragrances that I would recommend wearing if you are doing a spring or summer wedding. Two things now. Number one, I understand that a few of my recommendations are on the pricier side of things. These are unique niche fragrances that don't smell like anything else out there, so you are paying a little bit of a premium for that distinctiveness. Your wedding is a special day and if it fits in your budget, I would definitely recommend checking out some of these if they sound interesting. Number two, it's also very difficult to get a sense of a fragrance without actually smelling it yourself. In many instances, you can go online and order samples of each for a fraction of the price of a full bottle, which I would definitely encourage you to do. And if you have any specific questions about these fragrances, let me know."

        "transcript": " Alright, now that you've figured out your tuxedo, you've decided on your shirt, you've picked your bow tie style, the next thing to consider is what shoes to wear. In this video I'm going to be showing you the five different styles of formal shoes and at the end I'll quickly be going over some details such as socks and laces and then finally talking about a couple things to avoid. Formal shoe number one is a patent leather Oxford. An Oxford shoe is a specific type of shoe that's created with what's called a closed lacing. All this means is that the flaps of the leather that contain the lacing eyelets are sewn under the vamp as opposed to on top of it like you would see in a Derby shoe. The visual effect of this is that it almost looks like a single piece of leather which appears very simple and elegant and why the Oxford is considered such a great formal shoe. The patent leather Oxford is going to be the most formal of the five shoes we talk about So if you're wearing a classic two or three piece tuxedo and your dress code is very formal This is an excellent choice now for an even more elegant look You can go with what's called a hole cut shoe while an Oxford has the general appearance of being a cut from a single piece of leather The hole cut on the other hand is a cut from a single piece of leather The result is a very clean refined and elegant look that is both sophisticated and very stylish Formal shoe number two is a plain leather Oxford. This is going to be a small step down in formality from the patent leather Oxford due to the fact that it is not as shiny. Ideally your plain leather Oxford does not have a cap toe or any type of broguing which are perforations in the leather. However, it's not the end of the world if you do have a cap toe it'll just knock the formality of the shoe down a little bit. Like the patent leather Oxford you could also do the plain leather Oxford as a whole cut for some added elegance and sophistication. This type of shoe is a great choice for anything black tie, black tie optional, or semi-formal. Formal shoe number three is the opera pump. The opera pump is a very specific old school style of formal shoe. It's different from a loafer in that it has a deeper cutout, which means you're going to see more of the sock. The most distinctive feature of the classic opera pump is the bow. However, there are more modern versions with a single strip of fabric. If you if you happen to like the style, but aren't necessarily feeling the bow. The opera pump is elegant and very classic. And if you want that vibe for something black tie, this is the type of shoe you should consider. Formal shoe number four is the Belgian shoe. This is a very unique and quirky style of loafer known for its small and distinctive bow. The original comes from a small shop in New York City, but there are a variety of other brands that also make this style today. If you plan to wear a full tuxedo and like the loafer style, but not necessarily the opera pump. The Belgian shoe, especially in a patent leather, is a great alternative. Because of its uniqueness, the Belgian shoe is also a very natural choice for semi-formal cocktail attire, black tie optional and creative black tie dress codes. Though in each of those scenarios, you may consider a plain leather or suede version as they are less formal in appearance than patent leather. Formal shoe number five is the Velvet Slipper. This is the most informal of the five formal shoes we're looking at here. And some people will tell you to never wear velvet slippers outside of your own home. However, I think that's very outdated advice. Velvet slipper is an opportunity to have a little fun. They come in a variety of colors and often with some sort of embroidery, which is great for a monogram or something that shows off your interest and personality. Because these are the least formal of the formal shoes, I do not recommend wearing them with a full tuxedo. A velvet slipper will look best for a cocktail attire. black tie optional or creative black tie. Those are the five types of formal shoes. Now let's go over some details, including socks, laces, and a couple things to avoid. Most traditional sock to wear with formal wear is a black silk over the calf sock. It's got a translucent appearance, giving it a very elegant look. Silk socks can be a little pricey, not to mention difficult to find, not a big deal as any thin black sock will do the trick. Laces, obviously, should be black. The most classic formal and traditional lace would be a satin lace. However, a waxed cotton lace is also completely acceptable. You'll see both round and flat waxed cotton laces and you'll always want to choose the round as it looks more formal. Finally, two things to avoid when it comes to formal footwear. Number one, do not wear a square-toed shoes, shoes that are boxy or shoes that have a rubber sole. They look cheap and they do not match the polish and elegance of formal attire. Number two, do not wear boots. Although there are boots that are called dress boots, they do not match the level of formality of a tuxedo or an outfit with a dinner jacket. So that wraps up this overview of formal footwear. If you have any questions, let me know."

        "transcript": " All right, so after you've figured out all of the details that you want your tuxedo to have, the next step is to make sure that you're choosing the right shirt to pair with that tuxedo. There are a variety of different styles of tuxedo shirts and all of them have specific details that should be considered when it comes to the style of your tux, the formality of your event, as well as your own personal style and personal preferences. So in this video, we're going to be going over five specific styles and types of tuxedo shirts and the details of each so you'll be able to make the best choice for your wedding day. Tuxedo shirt number one is a wing collar shirt. This is going to be your most formal tuxedo shirt option and we're going to take a look at four of the shirts distinguishing characteristics. Number one is the collar itself with its two distinctive points that should go behind the bow tie rather than sticking straight up. Number two is the bib front, which will be in a different, more textured fabric than the shirt itself. Number three is that you will use studs with this type of shirt. And number four, this shirt should have a French cuff that you fasten with cuff links. As I mentioned, the wing collar shirt is your most formal tuxedo shirt, and it's actually very close to a white tie shirt. So if you want to wear a wing collar shirt, I recommend going with a three-piece peak lapel tuxedo. If you're leaning towards a shawl collar or a dinner jacket, this is not the shirt for you. Tuxedo shirt number two is what's called a self textured shirt. Self textured simply means that the shirt is in all the same fabric. We have a turned down collar on this one, a stud front, and French cuffs. Now the turned down collar as well as the absence of the bib front makes this shirt less formal than the wing collar shirt. It's one of the most versatile tuxedo shirts. It can work with a three-piece tuxedo, two-piece, with a waist covering, without, peak or shawl lapel, dinner jacket, you really can't go wrong. One detail to pay attention to that can increase or decrease the shirt's formality is the fabric that it's made with. A textured fabric like you see in this shirt is best for more formal options and a fabric with no texture would be less formal. Tuxedo shirt number three is the Pleser front. This is a very unique style of shirt that feels kind of European to me and you can see the alternating lines down the front which gives it a really nice textured appearance. Now this is a bib front shirt however with the turndown collar it's not quite as formal as the wing collar shirt. This shirt also has a stud front as well as French cuffs. In terms of formality the plezais front is a more formal shirt so I would recommend wearing it with a three-piece tuxedo or a cummerbund. If you don't want to wear a waist covering or you're doing a dinner jacket, I do not recommend choosing this style of shirt. Tuxedo shirt number four is the pleated front. This style of shirt is less formal and in my opinion, it's the swankiest of the bunch. Most distinctive feature obviously are the pleats. It's got a stud front as well, a turndown collar and French cuffs. Now one thing to know with the pleats is that the width of the pleats should match the frame of the wearer. So narrow pleats for skinnier guys and broader pleats for broader guys. Because the pleated front shirt has a bit of a cool factor to it, it's a great choice with a dinner jacket, especially one that might be in an interesting color or have a bit of texture or pattern on the fabric. If you're wearing a velvet jacket, this is the shirt that you are going to want. Also looks great with a double breasted tux and is a very versatile option. Tuxedo shirt number five is what's known as the plain front or fly front. This is a very versatile shirt and has a very contemporary feel and minimalist look due to the fact that the buttons are covered up so no need for studs with this one. Other details are the turndown collar and the french cuffs. This is really sort of your do anything all purpose tuxedo shirt. It can give a tuxedo a more modern and relaxed look and I also highly recommend it if you are wearing a dinner jacket. Now one thing I would actually highly recommend is that you have two shirts on your wedding day. It's going to be a very long day, probably starting out with photos, going to the venue, taking more photos, the ceremony, cocktail reception, dinner, dancing, and then whatever else you have planned for the evening after all of that. Your shirt's going to get dirty from all of that and that's not even considering the possibility of getting a stain from your bride's lipstick, your mom's tears of joy, or your best man's billing whiskey on you. So if you are planning to wear a tux, choosing one of the more formal shirt options and having a fly front shirt as well is great for hedging against any kind of mishap and a good choice for staying fresh throughout the day and transitioning to what is typically more casual as the night wears on. So that wraps up the five types of tuxedo shirts that I recommend. You saw a little bit of the way I would advise styling each type of shirt but later on in the inspiration section of the course you'll see the full outfits and how it all comes together. That's it for this video if you have any questions let me know."

        "transcript": " Look number one features a royal blue suit. Royal blue is an extremely popular color, very modern, and it's a great alternative to the more classic darker navy blue, which you'll see later on in this video. Jacket styling is very traditional here. It's a two button, notch lapel with flap pockets. And then we've kept the rest of the outfit super classic as well. A simple white shirt paired with a navy striped tie, which contrasts just the right amount with the blue of the suit. White pocket square done with the presidential fold and then finished off with a pair of dark brown Oxford shoes. An easy wedding suit look that's classic with a modern sensibility. Moving on to look number two, the first of two looks were showcasing that feature a medium gray suit. For this one, doing something very sleek, clean and minimal, always a great way to look sharp and focus attention on your bride. This jacket, as you can see, is two button, flat pockets and a peaked lapel, and a simple white shirt paired with a black grenadine tie. A grenadine tie is a great way to subtly add a little bit of texture and visual interest to a suit. Keeping with that minimalist approach here, we've got a white pocket square and some black Oxford shoes pulling in the black of the tie. Clean, simple and cohesive, great for an evening event. Look number three now, our second look featuring a classic medium gray suit. This time though, adding in a little bit of color via the burgundy tie. A deep burgundy like this is a really rich color and pairs very easily with gray. The tie also has a very simple pattern in the form of the white dots. And if you zoom in, you can also see the subtle pattern in the fabric, which is a nice little detail that adds some texture and visual interest. Pulling in the burgundy of the tie with the colored edge of the pocket square and also with the double monk strap shoes that anchor the outfit. a classic look with a rich and elegant pop of color. Next, moving on to look number four with our dark navy suit. And this is the first of three looks featuring this particular suit. For this one, we're keeping it clean, minimal, and more or less monochromatic, always an easy way to make a very powerful statement. Classic styling on the jacket, again, with two buttons, a notch lapel and flap pockets, crisp white shirt, paired with a navy grenadine tie, adding in that subtle texture along, with a very subtle herringbone you can see in the suit fabric. Going with a white silk pocket square with a puff fold and then finishing this look off with a pair of black oxfords. This is a very elegant and formal way to style a dark navy suit. For look number five, we're taking the same suit but bringing the formality of it down a couple notches in three specific ways. First, the tie. The contrasting lighter gray color makes it feel a lot less formal than the previous look while the classic stripe keeps it looking appropriately dressed up. Second, the pocket square. Instead of the puff fold, which I always find to be a bit more formal feeling, we're doing a presidential fold and showing off the edge. And third, instead of black shoes, we're going with a dark brown Oxford. Overall, still very dressy, though not quite as formal. Look number six, our third and final look, featuring the dark navy suit, is one that shows you how you can incorporate a bolder pattern tie into a more formal outfit. This particular plaid pattern is known as a Prince of Wales check. And one of the things I really like about it is that although up close it does seem rather bold, from a distance it doesn't have that effect. So it stands out, but not too much. Keeping the entire outfit monochromatic with the blue of the tie pattern playing really nicely with the ice blue shirt, a white silk pocket square with a puff fold playing into the formality, and then black oxfords to finish it off. A simple way to add some personality via a single standout piece. Look number seven is for those of you who may be considering a double-breasted suit, and we've got a really classic navy double-breasted suit. I feel like a double-breasted suit gives off the feeling of a lot of confidence and power, and if you're comfortable with it, it's a great way to do something a little different. Playing into the power aspect of it with a shirt choice, We're going with a classic bangle stripe shirt with a contrasting collar, mixing in some more stripes with the tie. Now, if you're gonna be mixing the same type of patterns together, always make sure they're different sizes. You can see the stripe of the tie is thinner than the stripe of the shirt. Simple white pocket square, and anchored by a pair of brown double monk strap shoes. Another double-breasted suit for look number eight, and we're featuring a brown double-breasted suit. I always consider brown to be a great alternative navy and gray as it's also a neutral color which makes it very easy to pair it with a variety of other colors. It's a great choice if you want to get away from something super classic in the color realm. However, we are keeping it monochromatic here. Remember monochromatic an easy way to make a big impactful statement with the addition of a striped brown tie. Simple white shirt and classic white pocket square providing some punch contrast. And then we're going with some brown double monk strap shoes once again. We're going a little more casual with look number nine and a khaki cotton suit. A khaki suit is pretty much the ultimate casual suit option so if you're looking to dial down the formality but do want to wear a suit this is a great choice. Gotta make sure the rest of the outfit does match that reduced level of dressiness and here we're doing that in a couple ways. First instead of a solid color shirt we've got a classic striped shirt and And then with the tie, this is a silk knit tie with squared off blades. One of the best more casual feeling tie options. Just a simple white pocket square and then a more casual derby shoe in a walnut color to finish it off. Finally for look number 10, another more casual styling option featuring a light gray suit. Light gray, perfect for daytime events and like a khaki suit, a natural choice for something with a more casual feel. Here we've got a classic blue shirt paired with a medallion print tie and notice how the colors in the tie complement the rest of the outfit as we have both blues and grays. This type of consideration really helps contribute to an extremely cohesive overall look. Keeping it on the more casual side also with the patterned pocket square with the bunny ears fold and then a classic pair of dark brown oxfords anchoring this look. So there you have it, 10 looks for some wedding suit inspiration. so many different ways to style a suit but hopefully these have started to get you thinking about what would work best for your wedding and your own personal style. Feel free to copy these exactly or modify to what you like best. If you have any specific questions about things that would work or wouldn't work be sure to let me know."

        "transcript": " Okay, if you're going to be wearing a tuxedo, there are some key decisions you have to make when it comes to a few specific styling details. These are important to pay attention to because these details have a huge effect on the look, feel, and overall vibe of your tuxedo. So in this video, I'm going to explain 10 specific tuxedo details. I'll introduce you to the terms you need to know, lay out the various options you have, about why you might choose one of those options over the other and give you some things to always look for as well as some things to avoid. We're going to quickly make you an expert here so you can make choices that best represent your personality and your personal style and the result is that you will not only look great in your tux but that you will feel comfortable and confident as well. We're going to start off with the tuxedo jacket and the first thing to consider is the style of the lapel. The lapel is the most distinguishing feature of a tuxedo and there are three different lapel styles. A notch lapel, a peaked lapel, and a shawl lapel. A peaked lapel extends upwards and forms a peak that points towards the shoulders, thus the name peaked lapel. This is going to be the most classic and timeless choice for a tuxedo jacket, never a bad option. A shawl lapel has a rounded shape and while it still has the same level of elegance and formality as a peaked lapel, I would say that there is a little bit of a relaxed sophistication to a Shaw lapel. So if you want that sort of casually elegant vibe, a Shaw lapel is a great choice. A Notch lapel is fairly uncommon for modern tuxedos. It is one of the most common and versatile lapel styles for suit jackets, but for my taste, it doesn't quite match the level of formality and elegance of a tuxedo, so it's not an option that I would recommend. Detail number two is the lapel fabric. So you've got two options here, satin or grosgrain. A satin lapel is going to have a smooth and shiny appearance. A grosgrain lapel is slightly ribbed so it has a textured and less shiny appearance. Both of these lapel fabric options are extremely classic so there is no wrong choice here. However, if you opt for a shawl collar, you're going to want to choose a satin lapel. Level number three is the lapel width. The width of your lapel should be proportional to two things, the width of your body and the width of your face. So if you're a broader guy, the lapel should be wider. If you're a narrower guy, the lapel should be slimmer. This is extremely important because for a tuxedo to look perfect, everything needs to be balanced and nothing can throw off that balance more than a lapel that's the wrong size. Now one of the biggest mistakes I see people make is to wear a jacket with a lapel that is too narrow. So generally speaking, the safe zone for a proper lapel width is 3.5 to 4 inches for a peak lapel and 3 to 3.5 inches for a shawl lapel. Detail number four is deciding between a single breasted jacket or a double breasted jacket. Single breasted jacket is going to be your most classic, traditional and conservative choice, going to look good no matter what. A double breasted jacket with its overlapping fabric and two sets of buttons is also very classic, though it definitely has a more formal appearance. Ultimately, the choice comes down to your personal preference, your personal style, and most importantly, your personal comfort zone. If you've never worn a double-breasted jacket before and are kind of on the fence about it, I would advise you to choose a single-breasted jacket. On your wedding day, you want to feel comfortable and confident, and if you're doing something new and outside of your comfort zone, that's going to affect how you carry yourself. Detail number five is the pocket style. Now there is only one acceptable pocket style for a tuxedo and that is a jetted pocket. A jetted pocket is just a very simple and clean line as opposed to the flat pocket or the patch pocket and the jetted pocket's trim should match the fabric of the lapel. Detail number six, the buttons or I should say the button. So while most suits will have two buttons sometimes three. A single-breasted tuxedo has only one button and a double-breasted tuxedo with a peak lapel four or six buttons, a shawl lapel two or four buttons. And once again just like the trim around the pocket the buttons facing or the fabric that's around the button should match the fabric of the lapel. Detail number seven is the jacket vent. A vent refers to the opening on the bottom back of the jacket and you've got three options for jacket vents. No vent, a single vent or a double vent. A jacket with no vent is going to be the most traditional and old school option. A single vent meaning just a single slit in the center. It's pretty uncommon for a tuxedo jacket and not what I would recommend. And a double vent where you've got openings on both sides is the most modern and updated choice. So if you want that classic old school kind of vibe, I would go with no vent. But if you consider your style to be classic with a modern sensibility, I would choose a double vent. Now we're gonna move on to the pants and detail number eight, side adjusters. Tuxedo pants do not have belt loops. And if your tuxedo pants do have belt loops, they're not tuxedo pants. In order to keep that simple and elegant look, tuxedo pants have side adjusters. You use the side adjusters to make fine adjustments to the waist size by either loosening or tightening them. Detail number nine is the fabric stripe down the side of the pants. Again, if your tuxedo pants don't have this feature, they're not tuxedo pants. And just like the pocket trim and button facing, the fabric of the stripe should match the fabric of the lapel. And finally, detail number 10 is the bottom finishing. Tuxedo pants should always have a plain bottom. The clean line matches the simplicity and elegance of the tuxedo, and it's the most formal way to finish the bottom of the pants. So there you have it. Those are the 10 specific styling details that you need to consider when it comes to choosing your tux. Understanding these and paying attention to them will really help you nail the style that you're going for resulting in you both looking great and feeling great. We're gonna be diving into some of the other individual components of a complete tuxedo look next. And if you have any questions about these details, let me know."

        "transcript": " There are two different reasons people feel the need to reinvent themselves. The first is when you have to make a change. In other words, when it's not your choice. If you're getting divorced, you've got to move on. If your company goes under, you've got to find another job because you need to make money to survive. The second reason is when you want to make a change. Maybe you feel like you've been wasting your life up until now, or maybe you just think it's time for something different. What I want you to know is that regardless of which of those two categories you fall into, making a change is possible. And your thirties is actually the best time to do that. So in this video, I'm going to be revealing five steps and five strategies for reinventing yourself so you can improve your life, improve your finances, improve your health, your mental health, and live the life that you want. Sound good? Stick around. I'm Brian Sakawa, you are watching He Spoke Style and on this channel I give you all the advice and inspiration you need to dress well, develop your personal style and gain more confidence. So what does it actually mean to reinvent yourself? I'll tell you what I think it means but first I want to talk about what it's not. Reinventing yourself is not an escape and it's not a way to run away from your past. We are products of our own experiences and the choices we've made. And to reinvent yourself, the key is to take those experiences, take those lessons you've learned, both the positive and the negative, and use them to improve yourself and to make changes that will allow you to make and live the life that you want. Now if you've decided that it's time to reinvent yourself and you've really made that commitment to do it, chances are you're very excited. You're looking forward to the change, to all the positive things that will come from it, all the happiness that you will experience as a result of making this change. But what you need to know is that it's going to take work because when it's time to reinvent yourself, you have to try. The best way to overcome the challenges that come with reinventing yourself is to really know yourself and your abilities. Ask yourself and be honest with yourself about what you're good at and also what your limitations or weaknesses are. Be practical and realistic with this stuff up front so you can create the best possible scenario for yourself to succeed. So for example, let's say that I wanted to completely change my life right now and the thing that I really wanted to do was to become a professional basketball player. First of all, I still get basketball, even when I practice. Second, I'm five feet, nine inches tall. And third, I'm 44 years old. It doesn't matter how bad I might want to be a professional basketball player. It's not gonna happen. And the fact that I can be honest and realistic with myself about the reasons it would never happen will save me from wasting a lot of time, wasting a lot of energy and ultimately being disappointed in the end. I'm not saying you can't dream big, but just always have that reality check in place. Another very important thing to think about before you jump into reinventing yourself is to align your goals with what really matters to you and what your needs are. If you can tap into that and be motivated by those intrinsic things, that stuff within you, then you will be much more likely to succeed and be happy than if you are motivated by some external force or what someone else wants you to do or thinks that you should do. This is huge, so spend some time really thinking about what exactly it is that you want. Now once you've done that, it gets exciting because you can start taking those first steps. And what I'm going to do now is to take you through each of those five steps, and then we're going to get into five specific strategies that you can use to reinvent yourself. Step number one is to make a plan. Not having a plan will almost always lead to failure. Now, I know we sometimes hear stories about people who just sort of wandered into something spontaneously and ended up having massive success. And those are great stories because they don't happen that often. It's very unlikely for something like that to happen, so it's not something that you should count on. Along the lines of really knowing yourself, making a plan to reinvent yourself really requires a thorough and honest assessment of your current financial situation, emotions, and mental state. As I mentioned before, it's important to be practical and realistic to give yourself the best chance of succeeding. And as you make this plan, have your goal in mind, but don't get hung up on figuring out every single step that you need to take and putting them in the right order. If you do that, it's very easy to never even get started. So think about it this way. Instead of following a map, you're using a compass. You know that you're going in the right direction, but going in the right direction doesn't always mean following a clear path. Step number two is to visualize success. Now I mentioned this in a previous video I did titled 10 Easy Ways to Be Better Every Day, which I highly recommend checking out once you're done here, linked right up there, because a lot of those tips are applicable to being successful at reinventing yourself. Visualizing success is important because what you're actually doing in the process of visualization is training your subconscious to be aware of the goal that you want to achieve. This works because what happens is your subconscious reminds you consistently about that goal. And it gets really cool because that then trains your brain to respond as if the outcome were true in the present moment. It's pretty cool and I know it works because I do it myself. And it doesn't have to be a big thing that takes a ton of your time, but you do have to do it consistently. I recommend taking five minutes every single day, maybe right when you get up in the morning. It's not a lot of time, but it is time well spent setting yourself up for success. Step number three is to set realistic goals. I sort of already touched on this with my wanting to be a professional basketball player example. So we don't really need to get too deep into that, But what I want to add is that setting a realistic goal doesn't mean you can't aim high. Please don't think I'm saying you have to go from one menial thing to another, because that's not what reinventing yourself is all about. Just understand that the higher you aim and the loftier your goal is, the harder you are going to have to work to make it happen. Step number four is to develop positive habits. Now, if you've ever been in a really good routine, you know the type of positive effect that it has on you. When you intergroove, you want to stay in that groove because it's working for you and you're seeing the benefits firsthand. I always like to use the example of exercise. When you commit yourself to a daily exercise routine, you get to a point where your body kind of craves it. And if you miss a day or two days, you really feel it. And it feels like your body is telling you, like, hey, man, I need to do this thing because it's making me feel really good. Now it's great when you're in that routine, but getting into it can sometimes be a little difficult. And since we're talking about reinventing yourself in your 30s, which implies that you're aging a little bit, let's talk about a simple positive routine that you can start right now that will help you look and feel your best as you transition into this next chapter of your life. I'm talking about skincare and particularly Tish Hanley's skincare system, who I'm proud to partner with for this video, because they make it super easy to get into that routine. And speaking from experience as a Tish Hanley user for over a year and a half now, this stuff actually works. So if Teej is new to you, all you really need to get started is their basic plan. That's a face cleanser, an exfoliating scrub, AM moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun, and a PM moisturizer for the important repair process that happens while you sleep. Personally, as a 44-year-old guy, I'd recommend going with Teej's level three system, which adds in a firming serum and an eye cream. Now, I mentioned that Teej makes it super easy to get into a routine, and here's what I mean. When you get that box in the mail and you open it up, there's a card and that card tells you what to do, it tells you when to do it, and it tells you how much of the product to use. Add to that when you subscribe. You don't even have to think about going out to get some more when you run out because it automatically comes to your door every month. So in addition to great skin, when you join Teej, there's lots of perks as well, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, pause or cancel at any time, no hassle refunds, free US shipping, as well as low-cost shipping to most other countries.

So instead, what we're going to do is to jump into the five strategies you can use to reinvent yourself in your 30s. Strategy number one is to step outside of your comfort zone. If you're planning to make a change as big as reinventing yourself, it is so important to be open and willing to break out of the safety zone that you've created for yourself. It's really easy to kind of sit back and be where you are, but if you're ready to reinvent yourself Sitting back and being where you are is not what you want to be doing if you're gonna completely change things Be prepared to be a little uncomfortable But use all those situations as learning experiences because you never know where you're going to end up I started this business just under 10 years ago and for that I didn't have photos taken all the time I never talked to a camera and to be honest, I felt really weird at first. But I looked at it as a challenge, as something new, as something to get better at, because in order to achieve the vision I had, which was to help as many guys as possible, dress well, gain more confidence and achieve their goals, it was something that I needed to do in the medium that I was working in. It wasn't easy, it was definitely outside of my comfort zone, but I kept at it, I kept working at it, and I'm glad that I did, because it has really helped me create a completely new life for myself. Strategy number two is to change your style. Hey, you're reinventing yourself. New life, new look. All I'm saying is it can't hurt because if there's one thing, and if there's one truth about clothes and your appearance, it's that it has an incredible power to change how you feel about yourself as well as how people see you, right? I mean, you've probably heard before, dress for the job that you want, not for the job that you have. So when it comes to reinventing yourself, consider some style changes to help put you on the path that you want to be on. Strategy number three is to learn something new. If you're really trying to reinvent yourself, you've got to make some big changes. Don't just incrementally tweak something here and there thinking that eventually you'll get to where you want to go. It doesn't work that way because if you're just doing little things here and there, it's going to always feel like it always felt. What you need to do is to turn everything upside down. Like that. Try something completely different, something you never thought you'd do before, or maybe reconnect with something that you used to love doing, but you haven't had time for or haven't made time for. The most important thing is that whatever it is that you choose to do, that you enjoy doing it. Reinventing yourself is all about making changes that will lead to a more positive and happier life with a greater sense of purpose and fulfillment. And if you don't love what you're doing, none of that's gonna be possible. Strategy number four is to accept changes. Change is one of the only constants in life. Things are always gonna be changing and how you respond to those changes will determine your outcome. So accept them and channel that energy into something positive. It's a classic glass half empty, glass half full scenario. Optimism will take you a very long way, especially when you're able to turn something negative into a positive. Strategy number five is to not fear failure and actually be ready for it. The one thing that all successful people have in common is that they have failed and they've probably failed multiple times. Now, the thing that sucks is when you look at someone who's successful, all you're seeing is that they're successful. What you're not seeing is the number of times they've failed to get to that point. But successful people are not afraid to fail. A failure is an opportunity to learn. A failure is an opportunity to get better. A failure is just another step on the path to success. Reinventing yourself. Things are going to change. Things are going to feel uncomfortable. Things are going to be new. And with all that stuff going on, there will be some failures. If you accept it and use it as a way to go forward, you will be successful, which brings us to perhaps the most important part of this whole process. Step number five to reinventing yourself. So what I'll say is, you know, if you've gone through all these steps, if you've made a plan, you visualize your success, set realistic goals, develop some positive routines, none of that matters unless you do something about it. Start now. Things don't have to be perfect. In fact, thinking too much about perfection is something that will always keep you from taking that first step. I remember when I was in grad school and I was in this class that I had to write a lot every single week. Now, I'm the kind of person that generally needs to map out everything before I do it, especially when I'm writing. But I would get so bogged down in making that outline and trying to figure out every single detail that I would just kind of like freeze up and it became very difficult for me to write anything at all. The advice my professor gave me was to just vomit on the page. Just start writing. It will come to you and you will be able to piece it all together. And you know what? He was right. And just starting is the most important step. Thanks once again to T. Shaly for sponsoring this video and reminder to click the first link in the description to receive 30% off, and your choice of a DoppKit, HandTal, or Body Scrub and Scrubber Combo as a free gift with your first box."

        "transcript": " All right, now whether you are renting a tuxedo or suit, having one made, or if you already have one in your closet that you plan to wear, in order to get a perfect fit, you're going to need to go to a tailor. The two most common questions I get are, how do I find a tailor and how do I know if that tailor is any good? I'll be answering both of those questions for you in this video as well as talking about what to expect, turnaround times and some things to consider when you are asking for specific alterations. Tip number one for finding a great tailor is to ask around. Word of mouth is the absolute best possible way to find a tailor. If you have a friend who dresses well and his clothing always fits perfectly, ask him who his tailor is. If you see someone on the street or in a store who looks like he's got his stuff together, doesn't matter whether he's a complete stranger or not, go up and ask him if he has a tailor that he recommends. In my experience, guys who are into style are always more than happy to share information like that. Tip number two, because this is the 21st century, do a Google search to find tailors in your area. That will quickly yield a lot of results and you'll also be able to see what kind of reviews they get. Now, once you find those three, four, or five tailors who look promising, I do recommend reviewing tip number one and asking around a bit because in my opinion, when it comes to knowing the quality of a tailor's work, it is always best to have some kind of personal connection or personal recommendation from someone you trust rather than just cold calling someone you have no experience with. Now aside from knowing whether a tailor is good at what he or she does, it is very important that that particular tailor is a good match for you. Just like any relationship, whether that's personal, business or romantic, a relationship with a tailor needs to be built on mutual trust and respect. Always keep in mind that any tailor is coming from a particular style background. So they may be very traditional and perhaps only used to older clients who are looking for a very traditional or classic style. So if you go to a tailor like that and they've never dealt with someone who's looking for something more modern like tapered leg or just a slight break, going in there and asking for that might really throw them for a loop and they might even tell you that you can't or shouldn't do that. Some tailors can be a little pushy like that and especially if you seem like you aren't quite sure exactly what you want. I've personally experienced that and it just sets up a weird dynamic to the relationship that's not good for anyone. The tailor is going to be frustrated, you're going to be frustrated, it's just a lose-lose situation. Along those lines, remember to be respectful and patient. Tell them what you like, listen to them if they want to offer some advice and then if If you feel like they're still not quite on the same style page as you, show them some examples of exactly what you're after so they can get a really clear visual picture of how you want to have your clothing tailored. If the tailor is good, regardless of their personal preferences, they will be able to do whatever you are asking. Let's talk about turnaround times. Now, how long will it take a tailor to do your alterations depends on two things. One, the type of alteration and two, how busy they are. alterations such as hemming pants, taking in or letting out the waist, or shortening a sleeve, I would say you could reasonably expect to get back in no more than a week's time. If you're talking about something a bit more involved like tapering the pant leg, shortening a jacket, or doing any type of work with the shoulders, that's going to take longer and not to mention be a lot more expensive. One final thing to remember is that tailoring is an art and not a science. It's not uncommon to have to do additional alterations, especially if you are getting a custom made suit or tuxedo. So there you have it. Those are my tips on how to find a quality tailor and how to work with a tailor. Now one thing I didn't cover in this video was price because that's going to be very dependent on the particular tailor that you go to. Some rental companies will do free alterations. Most custom suit companies will also not charge for alterations, but that will vary from company to company. To give you a ballpark idea of what alterations can cost, however, I put together a list of some of the most common alterations and what you might expect to pay for them. And that's down below this video. So that wraps it up. If you have any questions, let me know."

        "transcript": " All right, the number one most important thing when it comes to your outfit looking great is the fit. If the fit's not right, it's not going to look good. So in this video, I'm going to explain what you should be looking for to get that perfect fit. And we're going to be covering every single detail pertaining to the jacket, the pants, and shirt as well as some accessories including correct tie length, tie bar size and placement, and belt size. I can't stress enough just how critical this is. This is something you absolutely need to know and understand to look your best. So definitely pay attention to this video. We're going to start off with the jacket and talk about six key areas of fit beginning with the shoulders. This is one of the most important and critical areas of fit to get right. For a properly fitting jacket shoulder, the shoulder seam should end just before your arm starts to break downward. and the sleeve should follow that line and roll smoothly down your arm with no creasing or dimpling at the shoulder. If the seam is closer to your neck, the jacket will look too small, and if it extends past your shoulder, the jacket will look too big. Moving on now to the jacket collar and lapels. The jacket collar should lay flat against your shirt collar and the back of your neck. There should not be a gap between the jacket collar and the shirt collar. If you see this, it means the jacket does not fit properly. Similarly, the lapels should also lay flat against your chest. One of the most common issues you see with lapels is where they kind of fold up off of your chest. And that is a sign that the jacket is too tight. Both a collar gap and a lapel that doesn't lay flat are indications that either the jacket doesn't fit, the jacket is poorly made, or that you might have a specific posture or fit concern that doesn't make that particular brand a good match for you. Let's talk about how the jacket should lay on your back. If you see any stress at all on the seam running down the center of your back, that is a sign that the jacket is too tight. If there's a bunching up of the fabric below the collar called a collar roll, this could be a sign that you have square shoulders as opposed to sloping shoulders. And again, that this particular suit brand might not be a good match for you. This is relatively common and not the end of the world if it's not too severe, but if you do want that perfect fit, this is something to pay attention to. Next is the jacket closure. When you button your jacket, it should feel comfortable with just a little bit of play between the jacket and your body, and there should be no visible bunching of the fabric. It should be smooth around the button and across your body. If you're seeing any bunching up like that, this is a telltale sign that your jacket is too small. One quick tip on buttoning the jacket. If it's a two button jacket, always button the top button and never the bottom. Now let's talk about jacket length. This is something that can be a little subjective. However, a good rule of thumb is that the jacket should end at your thumb knuckle. Another way to determine if this is correct is if your arms are hanging down straight. When you make a fist, the tips of your fingers should just touch the bottom of the jacket. Another thing to note is that like a good lawyer, your jacket should always cover your butt. The final jacket fit consideration is the sleeve length. Ideally, the sleeve should end right about at your wrist bone. If it's too high, the sleeve's going to look too short. And if it's too low, the sleeve will look much too long. Now we're going to move on to our pants and two specific concerns starting off with the length. Now, before I talk about what is correct in terms of pant length, let me show you what is incorrect. This is too short where you're seeing a lot of ankle and sock. And this is too long where there's a lot of pooling of the fabric down by your ankles. Now, when we start to get into what is the correct or ideal pant length, that's when it gets very subjective and dependent on your personal style preferences, as well as your body type. When we talk about pant length, we use the term break, which refers to the fold or creasing of the fabric above where the pant leg meets your shoe. There are four different types of pant breaks and what I'm gonna do now is walk you through each one of them and Explain why you might choose one over the other pant break number one is no break The name kind of speaks for itself here and no break refers to absolutely no crease where the pant leg meets the shoe This is a very aggressive and fashion forward look and requires a tapered pant leg to look correct Which we will get to in a moment No break is the style that looks best on younger guys and and slimmer guys. Pant break number two is the slight break. With the slight break, the bottom of the pant leg is just going to be kissing the top of your shoe and have a very slight crease. The slight break is for the modern style conscious guy who likes the idea of no break but wants to avoid looking too trendy. Again, best for slimmer guys or those not carrying some extra weight around the midsection or up top. Pant break number three is the medium break. A medium brake is the perfect all-around length for anyone of any shape or size. If you've got a more conservative style, don't wanna be too trendy, and just want something that looks classic and natural, the medium brake is the style that you should choose. And pant brake number four is the full brake. The full brake is a more classic, old-school style that will only work with wider trousers. The full brake looks best on older gentlemen, heavier guys and vintage slash throwback situations. Now, once you've decided on the pant length that you prefer, the final consideration with regard to pants is the width of the leg. And the name of the game here is to have everything look proportional. So when you see the outfit as a whole, everything looks cohesive. Here it is especially important that you pay attention to your particular body type. If you're taller and slimmer, your pant leg can be narrower. And if you have broader shoulders or you're a broader guy in general, the pant leg is going to have to be wider to look correct. It's very trendy right now to have a slim pant leg and some custom suit companies will try to push you in that direction. But always remember that what's most important is that you dress your body and that you're true to that rather than trying to get a look that won't work for you. This is one of the keys to looking great. Let's move on now to how your shirt should fit. starting with the shoulder. A perfect fit for your shirt shoulder is exactly the same as the jacket shoulder. The seam should hit just before your shoulder ends with the sleeve falling smoothly down your arm. If the seam is closer to your neck, the shirt is too small, and if the seam extends to where your shoulder starts to break or goes beyond that, the shirt is too big. Moving on to the collar. A collar should not be too tight. You don't wanna feel like you're being choked, which is obviously incredibly uncomfortable. And you don't want your collar to be too loose either because that will look sloppy. The general rule to follow here is to be able to comfortably stick your index finger between the collar and your neck while the top button is buttoned. The fit around your body. Again, similar to having your suit buttoned, you don't wanna see any pulling on the fabric by the buttons when they're buttoned. This is a sign that the shirt is too tight. And you also don't wanna have a lot of excess fabric bunching up on the sides, which means your shirt is too large. When the fit is just right, it should feel comfortable. You should be able to move around easily and not feel constricted in any way. The final important consideration with your shirt is the sleeve length. If you've got the proper jacket sleeve length, you've got to make sure that your shirt sleeve length is right as well. Ideally, you're looking for it to hit just above your palm. If it's higher than your wrist bone, that's too short. and if it's extending over your wrist onto your palm, that means the sleeve is too long. The last question you might have about sleeve length is how much of your shirt cuff should show under your jacket sleeve? Although guidance varies on this question, it's generally accepted that you should show between a half inch and one inch of shirt cuff. Okay, now that you understand how your jacket, pants, and shirt should fit, let's move on to a few accessories, starting with your tie and the correct tie length. The tip of your tie should extend just past the top of your belt buckle. Too short looks a little silly and too long looks pretty sloppy. Now depending on the length of your tie or the length of your torso, you may run into a situation where the back blade of the tie is too long even if the front is perfect. Too quick solutions for that problem, you can either tuck the back blade inside your shirt or fold it up and pin it to keep it out of view. One final consideration here is that when you tighten the tie around your neck, you want it to be flush with the collar to avoid any gap between the collar and the top of the tie. Now if you're wearing a tie, you may consider wearing a tie bar, so let's talk about correct tie bar size and correct tie bar placement. In terms of size or length, it's all about proportion in relation to the width of your tie. A tie bar that's just about three quarters the width of your tie is just about perfect, And a tie bar should never be wider than your tie. In terms of placement, you want to wear it between the third and fourth buttons of your shirt right around your sternum. Too high or too low is going to throw off that balance and not look right. The angle of your tie bar should always be perpendicular to your tie and not crooked. And always be sure that you're attaching the tie bar to both your tie and your shirt placket since the purpose of a tie bar is to hold your tie in place. Finally, let's talk about your belt. When you're pairing a belt with your suit, you definitely want it to be the right size. Typically, your belt size is gonna be about two sizes larger than your waist size. And you'll know if you have the correct belt size, if the tip of the belt ends about halfway between your fly and your hip. One final thing to pay attention to with your belt is what's called the gig line. So when your shirt's tucked in, the placket of your shirt should form a straight line with your fly. and your belt buckle should also be in line with this. If any of these three things are off slightly, you can see how sloppy that looks. All right, I know that was a lot of information, but again, I can't stress enough just how important it is to understand the principles of proper fit. If you're wearing tuxedo or a wedding suit doesn't fit right, if your shirt doesn't fit right, if your tie is too long, if your tie bar is not right, if your belt is too long or too short, you will not look as good as I know you want to. Knowing how things should fit is the one secret to transforming your look from just okay or bad to absolute perfection. It is literally what separates a well-dressed guy from a guy who looks like he doesn't know what he's doing. This video is definitely worth watching again and I encourage you to do that. And getting the proper fit will require working with a tailor, which I will cover in the next video. However, if you have any questions about anything I explained in this video, let me know."

        "transcript": " There are a lot of reasons to build a sustainable wardrobe. You're helping to lessen the fashion industry's carbon footprint, supporting fair workplace practices and conditions, you're doing something positive and ethical, and you're saving money in the long run. That all sounds great, but if this is the first time you're actually thinking about making your wardrobe more sustainable, you might be wondering, well, how do I actually do this? The good news is that it's not that hard. And in this video, I've got 10 tips to help you get started. I'm Brian Sakawa, you are watching He Spoke Style and on this channel I give you all the advice and inspiration you need to dress better, develop your personal style, and gain more confidence. Alright, so what are we actually talking about when we're talking about a sustainable wardrobe? A sustainable wardrobe essentially refers to any clothes that are produced and consumed in an environmentally and socially conscious way. So the sustainability movement in fashion is a response to the fact that the fast fashion and fashion industries are responsible for a lot of bad things, which we'll get to in just a moment. One thing to understand as you start thinking about building a sustainable wardrobe is that technically there's no such thing as 100% sustainability because, you know, after all, even the greenest companies out there use resources and have an impact on the environment and the people around them. though it is possible to lessen that impact by building a sustainable wardrobe. So let's talk about why a sustainable wardrobe is important because it's one thing to suggest shopping sustainably, but another to really understand the full impact of doing so. Now to give you a better idea of why it's so important, here are a few quick facts and statistics about the fast fashion industry. Fast fashion is responsible for as much as 10% of all carbon emissions worldwide, and and that is mostly due to shipping and production. 20% of all wastewater in the world is the result of dying and treating fabrics. Approximately 87% of fibers used in textile production either end up in a landfill or are incinerated, which leads to further air pollution. Synthetic materials like polyester and microfibers are not biodegradable and end up dumped in oceans where they can remain for decades. And this information comes directly from two studies, this one and this one that are also linked down below in the description. Sustainable fashion exists to help reverse control and minimize the negative effects of the fashion industry. For example, unlike fast fashion brands, eco-friendly clothing is constructed with organic materials. These materials are renewable and produced in a way that's safe for factory employees and the environment. Now it's okay if you already have non-sustainable clothes in the closet, but it never hurts to be aware of the environmental and social impact of the things we buy and wear. By keeping sustainability in mind when you shop, you can make a difference in lessening those problems. Okay, so the big question now is, how do you actually build a sustainable wardrobe? Well, here are 10 tips to help you get started. Tip number one is to organize and plan your wardrobe. So the first step is to actually take a step back. at what you already own and try to see those clothes in a new light. Look at the tags, see how they're made, what materials are used, are there any dyes involved, and when you do that, ask yourself what kind of impact those clothes might have on the environment. Some pieces that you already have might be semi-sustainable like anything made from organic cotton or wool. Others might have been locally sourced and produced, which would mean that they have a smaller carbon footprint. The goal here isn't to identify the bad things in your wardrobe and toss them out. It's to figure out what you have and see where there's room to improve upon as you start acquiring more pieces through the lens of building a more sustainable wardrobe. Tip number two is to deal with unused excess. So a lot of people have items in their closet from long ago that either don't fit anymore or aren't really their current style. So if that sounds like you, chances are you have clothes you no longer wear that are just taking up space in your closet. The first thing you might think to do is to get rid of them. And while getting rid of them might sound like a good idea, you need to make sure that you do it in an environmentally safe way. Because if you don't, that shirt or paralevized jeans could just end up in a landfill somewhere. If your clothes are in good shape, instead of just throwing them in the trash, which is very easy to do, ask around if anyone you know is interested in taking them off your hands. Consider donating them to places like the Salvation Army, Goodwill or another local thrift store because part of promoting sustainable fashion and sustainability in general is about recycling and reusing things. And then you know say you're not quite sure if you're ready to get rid of something yet. Set it aside for a few weeks and then after that time if you haven't worn it or even thought about it, go ahead and donate it as well. Remember the goal here is to use what you have, recycle what you don't need and reduce excess. Tip number three is to fix up and repair worn items. Even the best construction and highest quality garments won't hold up forever no matter how well you take care of them. If you're handy with a needle and thread or sewing machine you can always do some of these repairs yourself otherwise if not find a tailor to fix up the clothing instead. Now if something you love is completely beyond repair do not immediately throw it away. Instead, consider repurposing it into something more functional or decorative. Depending on the garment, you might be able to use parts of it to make a dog toy or convert it to rags. If it's really worn out though, consider donating it to a local animal shelter. Many shelters will take old, unusable clothing and blankets since they make great beds for the animals. Tip number four is to rethink how you shop and research brands thoroughly. The next time you go shopping for clothes, think about what you need and where it's coming from. A lot of people impulse shop and quickly buy things to add to their wardrobe on a whim, but newsflash, this is not the most sustainable way to shop. Instead, try to have a solid idea of what would fit your style and make your wardrobe even better than before. Once you've settled on what you need, do some research into ethical brands that offer those types of clothes, see how they get their materials, and if the working conditions and wages are good for their employees. One way to make sure you're choosing a good brand is if they mention locally sourced and produced on their labels or website. Another option is to go with brands that produce made-to-measure garments since those usually mean less waste and no overproduction. Tip number five is to purchase custom menswear. So there are several benefits to buying bespoke or made-to-measure menswear, especially if the alternative is going with a major chain store or fast fashion brand. For one thing, custom-made clothing doesn't have the same problem with overproduction that's common with many fast fashion brands. With custom tailored menswear, you can build a sustainable wardrobe that suits your preferences and fits exactly the way you want it to without contributing to excess waste. Many made-to-measure shops, including our own, offer high quality custom garments ranging from suits, jackets, shirts, outerwear, knitwear, shoes, and accessories. And because these garments are not mass produced, you can be assured that every piece is made with the best craftsmanship and a focus on style and longevity. Tip number six is to view your wardrobe as an investment. When we talk about a sustainable wardrobe, we're talking about one that's meant to last a long time. So every time you go shopping for new clothes, consider each item you're looking at as an investment. Sustainable and eco-friendly clothing can be more expensive than what you find at most retailers, but the trade-off is that it it will hold up much longer. This gives it a much lower cost per wear ratio, which in other words means it pays for itself over time and several times over. Tip number seven is to think outside the box. There are certain wardrobe essentials that you have to have, but that doesn't mean that you can't get creative with it. Because one way to build a sustainable wardrobe is to keep an open mind when you're shopping. If you have those basics and those staples in your closet and you've been watching this channel for a long time, you know just how versatile those pieces can be. But you can expand that even more if you add a couple statement pieces into the mix. Tip number eight is to take care of your clothes. Focusing on quality and fabric and construction is one way to build a sustainable wardrobe, but it's not the only thing that matters. It's easy to toss dirty clothes in the washing machine and dryer, but it's not necessarily a good idea. Most clothes have specific washing instructions, and some even suggest washing them alone. or leaving them out to air dry or using a tumble dry low cycle. And while you're at it, try to use detergents that are non-toxic or derived from plants since they're better for the environment. And when it comes to dry cleaning your suits and sport coats, do this sparingly and only when you absolutely need to. It might be an extra step now, but taking care of your clothing properly will ensure that they last a lot longer. Tip number nine is to avoid and buy certain fabrics. An eco-friendly or sustainable wardrobe should mainly consist of natural or organic materials such as hemp, cotton, and wool. These fabrics are better than synthetic ones because they can break down naturally and compost cleanly into the environment. Plus, certain plastics can leach harmful chemicals into the air, which leads to more pollution. Check if your clothes have any dyes. Eco-friendly dyes are fine, but there are a lot more toxic dyes out there. And some clothing brands market their products as eco-friendly, without taking into consideration the production process or dies you. So do your research. When building a sustainable wardrobe, look for official organic certifications like this so you can be sure that your clothes are truly eco-friendly. Tip number 10 is to shop vintage. You can find an incredible number of unique styles, designs, and brands at estate sales, thrift shops, and even online. eBay is a great place for that. Plus, since you're essentially recycling something that already exists, you're promoting sustainability. Remember, shopping vintage doesn't mean sacrificing quality. In fact, to the contrary, a lot of vintage items are higher quality because they've held up for so long. And chances are, they'll last a good deal longer with proper care. More brands than ever have shifted gears to focus on sourcing, designing, producing, and distributing sustainable clothing. Once you know what to look for and what to avoid, building a sustainable menswear wardrobe can actually be quite easy. When you shop sustainably, you have the opportunity to help out the environment, support fair labor practices, safe working conditions, and cut down on waste. All it takes is that first step. Here at He Spoke Style, we truly believe in all those things, and it's one of the reasons I'm constantly preaching about building a wardrobe full of versatile basics.

        "transcript": " Okay, so you've most likely already chosen a dress code for your wedding, but deciding what to wear for that dress code and getting it right is probably why you're here. So what we're going to do now is to walk you through eight of the most common wedding dress codes and I'll explain what each dress code means as well as what is appropriate to wear for that dress code. Two things I want to mention before we jump into this video, however, number one, that This is not a definitive list. And number two, that it does not cover all the options and possibilities within each dress code. All I wanna do here with this first video is to give you a broad overview to get you in the ballpark. And then as we go through the rest of the course, you will gain all the knowledge you need to really dial in exactly what you're looking for so that you can look and feel your best. Dress code number one is black tie. Black tie is a very common wedding dress code and one of the most formal and prescriptive. Unlike many of the other dress codes we'll talk about, with black tie, there's not much room to do anything beyond what the rules say. So basic outfit checklist for black tie, a black tuxedo, white tuxedo shirt, stud set, cufflinks, a cummerbund or vest, black bow tie, white pocket square, and black patent leather shoes. If there seems like there's not too much room for creativity here, black tie is kind of designed be that way. However, there are definitely ways that you can add personal touches, which I'll cover in depth in a video later on in the course. Dress code number two is black tie optional, sometimes referred to as formal. Now the thing to know about black tie optional is that the optional part of black tie optional doesn't really apply. Black tie optional still basically means to wear a tuxedo. And this particular dress code I would say is really designed more for wedding guests who might not have a tuxedo to wear to your wedding, chances are that if you're saying the dress code is black tie optional that you're going to be wearing a tuxedo. Now in terms of your tuxedo black tie optional does give you the option to play around with color a little bit so instead of a classic black tux you may opt for a midnight blue tuxedo and then the checklist remains the same as black tie white tuxedo shirt stud set cufflinks a cummerbund or vest black bow tie white pocket square and black patent leather shoes. Dress code number three is creative black tie. Creative black tie is another type of formal dress code, however not nearly as prescriptive in terms of the rules you have to follow as black tie or black tie optional. Think of creative black tie as formality minus the rigor and stuffiness. Unlike black tie and black tie optional where you really don't have a lot of room to go outside traditional boundaries with creative black tie adding some personality and and flair is not only recommended, but often encouraged. Now, what does all this mean in terms of what to wear? Creative Black Tie is the perfect dress code for a dinner jacket. And the dinner jacket you choose depends on the overall vibe of your wedding and your own personal style. For something very classic and sophisticated, an off-white or cream colored dinner jacket is a great option. For something modern and elegant, you might choose a burgundy dinner jacket. And then if you wanna get really creative, You know, the sky's the limit. You could go with velvet or something patterned. Checklist now for creative black tie. In addition to your dinner jacket, you'll need tuxedo pants, a tuxedo shirt, bow tie, cufflinks, pocket square, and either a patent leather shoe or velvet slipper. Dress code number four is cocktail attire slash semi-formal. Cocktail attire is a great balance between elegance and comfort. It's not as formal as any of the black tie dress codes we've talked about, but it is still very stylish and sophisticated. Typically, the cocktail attire dress code is going to be for an evening event, so as far as your checklist is concerned, we're talking dark suit, solid color shirt, necktie, pocket square, and black, brown, or oxblood leather shoes. Now, I know you're probably thinking, well, what color suit should I wear, and how do I choose the correct shirt? What's the right pocket square and tie combination, and how do I match my shoes to my suit? All of that will be covered in detail in section three of the course, which deals specifically with wedding suit style. All you need to know now at this point is that cocktail attire equals suit. Dress code number five is dressy casual, which I know kind of sounds like an oxymoron, and we're also going to throw in casual to this mix in dress code as well. I would approach any type of casual wedding dress code as more of a business casual vibe. Casual as a wedding dress code does not mean t-shirt and sneakers. When I think of business casual, I think put together but relaxed at the same time. So at the bare minimum, we're talking a sport coat, dress shirt, nice dress pants or chinos, lace up shoes or loafers, pocket square and the tie being optional. Dress code number six is tropical slash beach. Now, if you're getting married in a warm environment like this, and in this type of setting, there are two big things to pay attention to when choosing your wedding attire. Number one is to be sure to choose lighter colors. We're talking tan, khaki, white, cream, or royal blue. And then number two is to understand the importance of fabric choice. If it's gonna be hot, you want a fabric that is light and breathable, such as linen, cotton, seersucker, or fresco. With a tropical or beach wedding, you could go either way in terms of tuxedo or suit. However, I would suggest that if it's a daytime event, you go with a suit, tie is optional. And then if it's an evening event, a tuxedo in the right fabric is also appropriate. Dress code number seven is rustic. Popular for backyard weddings, outdoor weddings, and themed weddings, you can actually go one of two ways with a rustic dress code. Rustic does sort of imply a more casual approach, as well as one with a little more of a rugged feel. So like the tropical beach dress code, you really kind of want to dress to match your environment. I wouldn't normally recommend it for a wedding, but for a casual rustic wedding, a blazer with a dress shirt, dark denim and boots might be a nice choice. The other way you could go with a rustic wedding is to dress up more like a suit, for example, but really play into the rustic vibes with your fabric choice. If it's a cooler night in the fall, a tweed suit or a flannel suit or a Harris tweed sport coat with flannel pants could be a really nice compliment to an environment like that. So in this dress code overview, we've pretty much been going from formal to casual. However, there is one more dress code to cover, which is the most formal, and that is dress code number eight, white tie. Not a dress code you see very often, definitely not a popular wedding dress code, but I wanted to include it mostly to clear up any confusion there might be. White tie does not simply mean wearing a white bow tie with your tuxedo. For a proper white tie outfit, there are three very specific things you need to have in addition to the white tie. Number one is a tailcoat. As you can see, very different from a regular tuxedo jacket. Number two is a wing collar formal shirt. And number three is a special white waistcoat. Again, probably not a dress code you're considering, but important to understand what makes it distinct. So there you have it, a quick look eight wedding dress codes that gives you a good overview of everything from the formality of each dress code and answers the question of whether to wear a suit or a tuxedo and also now you have a checklist of things you need and that we can now start thinking about more in detail as we move through the course. Welcome to the Groom Guide once again and if you have any questions let me know."

It starts with you. In order to get all those things that you want, you need to act apart. And you can do that by following these 20 rules that every man should live by. I'm Brian Sakawa. You are watching He Spoke Style. And on this channel, I give you the advice and inspiration you need to dress better, develop your personal style, and gain more confidence. Before jumping into the 20 rules every man should live by, a few things to note. First, these 20 rules are geared not only towards helping you get those things you want, respect, success, confidence, and influence, but more importantly, they are geared towards helping you be the best person that you can be. Second, these are things you can apply to your life no matter what age you are, young, old, or somewhere in between. And third, some of these things are going to be pretty simple with no extra explanation required, but where appropriate, we will get into more detail. So without further ado, let's get to it. The first rule every man should live by is a very important one, and that is to be authentic. When you're true to yourself, not only will you trust the judgments and decisions you make but others will be more likely to trust you as well. Being authentic means having more integrity and never second guessing if you're doing the right thing. When you're honest with yourself, that gives you more strength and openness to deal with problems quickly and make necessary changes. When you trust yourself to do what's right, that increases your potential and self-esteem. And being authentic is far less stressful than trying to be someone you're not. Next, don't be a troll. Say something to someone on the internet that you wouldn't say to their face. It's cowardly, it shows a lack of character, and really, what are you accomplishing with your comment? It's fine to engage in a discussion, it's fine to disagree, but if you're going to do that online, make sure you're respectful and don't be a jerk. Nobody likes people like that, especially those of us with YouTube channels. Now since we're talking about online behavior, let's talk about when you're hanging out with friends or family or out on a date. Put the phone down and live in the moment. If you're constantly looking down at your phone, you're not engaged, you're showing disrespect to the people around you, and you're missing the whole point of being out, which is to make a connection with people and enjoy the moment. If you're looking here, everything out there is passing you by. Next, pick up some wet wipes for the bathroom. You'll thank me later. The next rule you should live by is to listen more and talk less. When you talk, you're repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you might learn something new. Like Richard Branson said, nobody ever learned anything by hearing themselves speak. And while you're listening, be sure that you're engaged and really hearing and understanding what the other person is saying, not just waiting to add your two cents. Our next rule is to always have good posture. Sit up in your chair and stand tall. Not only is it better for your health, but it helps you project a more powerful image. When you slouch, you look unsure of yourself. You look weak. You look kind of sad and depressed. And that is not someone that a stranger, man or woman, would want to talk to or listen to. But when you stand with good posture, you look more confident, you look powerful, you look like someone people will listen to. The next rule to live by is to understand that life is a marathon and not a sprint, especially when it comes to maintaining your health and your body. You've got to develop routines and stick to them because if you don't, it might be too late to reverse any negative effects. Unlike a test, you can't cram for this stuff. For example, if you go through life, never taking care of your skin, never wearing sunscreen, never moisturizing, never exfoliating, don't be surprised if you start to look older faster than someone who does. That's why I am a huge fan of Teesh Handly, today's video sponsor, because they've got all the products you need and they make it super simple to develop that routine. All you really need to get started is their basic plan. That's a face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, AM moisturizer with SPF to protect your skin from the sun, and a PM moisturizer for the important repair process that happens while you sleep. Now, if you're an older gentleman, such as myself, I'd recommend going with Teej's level three system, which adds in a firming serum and an eye cream. I mentioned that Teej makes it super easy to get into a routine, and here's what I mean. When you get your box and open it up, there's a card, and that card tells you what to do, when to do it, and how much of the product to use. Add to that, when you subscribe, you don't even have to think about going out to get some more when you run out, because it automatically comes to your door every month. So in addition to great skin, when you join Tees, there's lots of perks, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, pause or cancel at any time, no hassle refunds, free US shipping, as well as low cost shipping to most other countries. And because Teach Handly is sponsoring today's video, they're offering you guys a great deal, just click the first link in the description to get Teach Handly for 30% off and choose a DoppKit, HandTowel or Body Wash and Scrubber combo as a free gift. Click that link to get started today. Next is to be kind and show respect. How you treat people says a lot about you and it also affects how people see you. It doesn't matter whether it's face to face, on the phone, or online. If you treat people well, if you're kind, and if you show respect, that reflects well on you, and it also makes a nice deposit in the Karma Bank. Along the lines of respect, our next rule is to always dress appropriately for the situation or occasion. This is especially important if the dress code is more dressed up. It shows that you respect the people you're with, and by putting effort into your own appearance, it shows that you care. Like Tom Ford said, dressing well is a form of good manners. Moving on to our next rule, and that is when it comes to cologne, less is more. Wearing a fragrance is a way to invite people in closer. If you keep it subtle, it's intriguing and mysterious, but if you wear too much cologne, that's gonna repel people. Don't be too much cologne guy. Now this next rule can be a little more difficult for some people to fully embrace and be comfortable with. If you're a naturally confident guy, this one might come a little bit easier to you. But if you're shy, this one's gonna take a little bit of effort. When you go into a social situation, assume people like you. That's gonna throw off some good vibes and people will be more likely to engage with you and to accept you. But if you go into that same situation thinking people don't like you, that's gonna project a different kind of energy, negative energy and put up a wall between you and the people you want to connect with. The next rule is to set goals, write them down and refer back to them often. Set goals for yourself because you need to have something to work towards and taking the time to think about these goals is an important part of improving ourselves. Write down your goals to hold yourself accountable and refer back to them often to see your progress or where you've still got work to do. Going on, be sure to read as much as you can. Knowledge is power and great minds are always feared by lesser minds. If you're invited to someone's home, always bring a gift. Now, the type of gift you bring or the value of that gift is certainly dependent on the type of event. If you're just going over to hang out and watch TV, six pack of beer is probably okay. For a dinner party, consider bringing a nice bottle of wine. for something like housewarming party, maybe something a little more special, like a bottle of nice champagne, really nice whiskey, or maybe even something like a fancy corkscrew. It's always a nice touch when you put that extra thought into something and it will always be appreciated. The next rule is to cultivate and value a small group of friends. When life hits you with something, you need people you can lean on. So it's more important to have a close knit group of friends who really know you and care about you and that you can trust rather than tons of acquaintances who you really aren't that close with. Open doors for women. It's not chivalrous, it's thoughtful, and she'll appreciate it. Our next rule is to take chances. Now, I'm not saying to constantly be reckless, but sometimes going a little outside of your comfort zone and taking a risk with something can yield incredible results. You'll always regret the chances you didn't take because even if you fail, no one's ever said they're sorry they tried. Next, you should only worry when it's truly warranted. It's okay to worry about things from time to time, but you can't worry about everything. Pick and choose your battles and rack and stack your priorities to figure out what's most important to you and what's really worth your time. All that other stuff, forget about it. Now I like to say that there are things you can control and things you can't. And this next rule is definitely one that you can control. Choose to be happy. Seriously, it's up to you. Now, I could say that this is half empty or I could say that this is half full. It's my choice and focusing on the positive will lead to greater fulfillment, confidence, and success. Finally, the last rule to live by is to understand that there are no rules except for laws. You should follow those. But rules are guidelines, especially when it comes to style. It's good to know the rules, and I definitely encourage you to know the rules, but ultimately, to develop your own sense of style and your own personality, you take those rules and make them your own. Thanks once again to T-Shanley for sponsoring this video and reminder to click the first link in the description to receive 30% off and your choice of a DoppKit, HandTal, or Body Scrub and Scrubber combo as a free gift with your first box."

        "transcript": " If you are not trying to be better every single day, what are you doing? And if your answer to that question is, I don't know, let me tell you what you're doing. You're wasting your life. And I'm not apologizing if that hits you pretty hard, because maybe you don't know where to start. Maybe you don't know what to do. Maybe you're thinking, it's too hard. I can't do it. Well, you can do it. And I'm going to help you out by giving you 10 easy ways to be better every single day. I'm Brian Sakawa. You are watching He Spoke Style and on this channel I give you the advice and inspiration you need to dress better, develop your personal style, and gain more confidence. All right, starting off here. So the number one thing I think that can prevent you from being better every single day might be a little tricky and difficult to navigate. it will require you to make a huge shift in your life and how you move through it. In fact, I will go so far as to say that it may be one of the most difficult things you'll ever have to do. If you have toxic people and toxic relationships in your life, now is the time to remove them. Get rid of toxic people because they bring you down and keep you from being better. In many cases, these kinds of people don't want you to succeed and what kind of friend is that? I said it could be difficult because a lot of times, you know, these are people that have been in our lives for a very long time Maybe you grew up with this person but if that's a toxic relationship and that person brings you down and Doesn't make you feel good about yourself the relief you will feel getting rid of this relationship Will far outweigh any comfort you feel just because you've known this person your whole life Trust me. The next thing you can do to be better every single day requires you to stop for a second and think. Think about what it is that you want and visualize your goals. This type of visualization is important. I know that it works because I do it myself but I didn't know why it worked so I looked it up. Basically what you are doing in the process of visualization is that you are training your subconscious to be aware of that end goal that you have in mind. And if you do that, what happens is your subconscious reminds you consistently about that goal. And here's where it gets really cool because that then trains your brain to respond as if that outcome were true in the present moment right now. Listen, we live in a ridiculously fast-paced society with constant information, lots of interruptions, distractions. So the hardest thing here is going to be making time to stop, slow down, clear your head, and visualize your goals. And I'm not saying you've got to block off like an hour every single day to do this. Just start with every morning. Take five minutes, max, and do this. It's time well spent wiring your brain for success. So the idea of stopping and taking time actually flows really nicely into the next thing you can do every day to be better because what happens when we just get caught up in that whirlpool of everything going on around us is that we just start wasting time. How many times, be honest now, how many times have you picked up your phone, started scrolling, open and close the same app like three times in a row and then like 45 minutes later you're like, what just happened all that time? And I like literally have absolutely no idea what I just did and nothing to show for it. It is so easy to fall into that trap and wasting time like that takes you away from being better and accomplishing your goals. So what can you do? Do things with intention. So if you decide, this is the thing I'm gonna do, do that and nothing else. Where I find myself falling into that unproductive, circular time wasting loop is when I'm sitting at my computer with like 10 to 15 tabs open in my browser All competing for my attention. So if there's something I really have to do like focus on writing Editing giving feedback for a video. I'll open a new browser window with just one tab So there's nothing else distracting me I mean it sounds like so easy when I say it like that But it does take effort and I always get way more done when I focus and stop wasting time Now the whole time-wasting thing as I described it, what that is, is a bad habit. It is an unproductive routine. And if there's one thing that's true about bad habits and unproductive routines, it's that they're easy to fall into and very hard to break. But in order to be better every day, you need to develop productive routines. And the specific routine I want to focus on here is one that has tons of power to influence how you feel, how you see yourself, how other people see you, and one that has incredible short-term and long-term benefits. Now what I find kind of fascinating is that bad habits are easy to fall into, but good habits and good routines can sometimes be more difficult to develop because it often feels like they take more effort. And developing a good skin care routine can often feel like that, but that's why I'm proud to partner with Tish Hanley, today's video sponsor, because they make getting into this productive routine so easy. When that box comes in the mail and you open it up, the thing you immediately see is a card with some information on it. And I love this card. It tells me what I need to do, when I need to do it, and how much of the product to use. Now which products do you actually need to get started? So if Tish Hanley is new to you, I would recommend starting with their basic plan, which gives you all the important basics and essentials. So we're talking face cleanser, an exfoliating scrub, an AM moisturizer with SPF that helps protect your skin against the sun throughout the day, and also a PM moisturizer which is important for the repair process that happens while you're sleeping. Personally, I do like to add in a couple other products to my routine as well so that's why I really like Teige's level 3 system which includes a firming serum and an eye cream. In addition to great skin when you join Teige you get tons of perks including at at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, pause or cancel at any time, no hassle refunds and free US shipping and low-cost shipping to most other countries.

Click that link to get started for just $30. Okay, so of the many things that can cause stress in your life and prevent you from being better, I think money and financial doubt is kind of at the top of that list. If you're not in a good position, it can contribute to insecurity, lack of self-worth, and maybe even depression. And all of those things are very difficult to overcome. Now, everyone has different financial situations, but I think regardless of where you are, that you should make a plan to save money and be disciplined about it. I think back to times in my life when I wasn't particularly financially stable and those were some of the darkest times for me. Do not underestimate the power that financial security or independence or having that safety net can have on your ability to improve yourself. So talk with someone, get online and do some reading and start making a plan to save that fits within your budget. Now we just talked about saving money But the next thing that can help you be better is giving money. Donating has incredibly positive effects. And I'm not just making this up because there are studies that prove it. And here are five ways that giving makes us better. Number one, giving makes us happy. So if you don't believe it, there was a Harvard Business School study that found that giving money to someone else lifted participants' happiness more than if they spent it on themselves. and a study from the NIH found that when people give to charities, it activates regions of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection, and trust, creating a warm glow effect. Who doesn't want to have a warm glow? Number two, giving is good for your health. So there's been a wide range of research that links generosity to better health and decreased stress. Number three, giving promotes cooperation and social connectedness. So basically when you give, you are likely to be rewarded more in the future and that trust you create is central to both mental and physical health. Number four, giving evokes gratitude. And research has found that gratitude is one of the keys to health, happiness, and strong social bonds. When you express gratitude, you boost your own positivity and others positivity as well. And number five, giving is contagious. When you give, it inspires others to do the same and all of those good feelings have a halo effect. And the last thing I'll say about giving as a way to be better is that you don't have to give a lot to make a big difference. Now, if you're not able to give money, what I would encourage you to do as a different way to be better is to give some of your time to be a mentor to someone. This is probably one of the most important things can spend your time doing. It's a form of giving back. It gives you a new perspective. It gives you a deeper appreciation for your own value and worth and what you have to offer. It helps improve your communication skills and develop leadership skills. I personally volunteer as a mentor for the Empire State Youth Orchestra's Young Leader Program. So I was in this youth orchestra when I was in high school. It had a big impact on my life and I gotta tell you it feels great to give back to an organization like that and inspire the next generation. Now you can't be better every day if you don't have energy and you're not well rested. If feeling tired throughout the day is a problem you have and it impacts your ability to be your best, you are going to want to improve your sleep habits. Now what are some things you can do to improve that? First is to stick to a schedule. You get in a rhythm, your body likes it, good things happen. Second, pay attention to what you eat and drink. Don't eat a big meal before bed. Don't drink too much. Both of these things will affect the quality of your sleep. Third, create a restful environment free of distractions. Don't watch TV in bed. Put the phone down. Instead, read a book or just lay there in silence. Fourth, manage your stress. And one of the easiest ways to get rid of some of that stress is to get organized. Put things away, plan out some things for the next day, and then forget about it. And fifth is to include some type of physical activity throughout the day. If your body is working, you'll have more of the right kind of tired and you will sleep better. And speaking of physical activity, not only will it help improve your sleep habits, but it is also a way to be better every day. Now we often talk about the benefits of fitness on physical health. It's pretty self-explanatory. What I want to talk about are the benefits that fitness has on your mental health. In addition to better sleep, which has its own positive mental effects, exercise can contribute to sharper mental thinking, increased self-confidence, more energy, and stronger resilience. It can also help fight depression, lower stress, and decrease anxiety. I don't know about you, but all of those things sound pretty good when you're talking about trying to be better every single day. The last thing you can do to be better every single day is to be in a certain mindset. Thinking positively is incredibly powerful. Think about it. If you tell yourself that you can't do something, if you believe that you can't do something, well, guess what? Chances are, it's not going to happen. But if you think positively and believe in yourself, the potential for success increases exponentially. Now, if this kind of thinking doesn't come naturally to you, to get yourself on a path of thinking more positively, go back and review everything that we've just talked about in this video. But especially the first thing, removing toxic people from your life. If you want to begin thinking more positively, surround yourself with positive people. It will motivate you, it will inspire you, and the energy you will feel will help you be better every day.

        "transcript": " As you get older, you find yourself at a certain crossroads. Should you try to look younger or should you embrace the fact that you're aging? Now there are a lot of mistakes you can make as an older guy trying to look younger, but did you know that there are some things that you might be doing that can actually make you look even older? Aging is fine and I think we should embrace it, but you know, we definitely don't want to look older than we are. And in this video, I'll be revealing eight mistakes that us older guys make that actually make us look older. I'm Brian Zacaua and you are watching He Spoke Style. If you want to dress better, develop your personal style and gain more confidence, you've come to the right place because on this channel I give you all the advice and inspiration you need to do just that. Alright so we all know this guy I'm about to describe. He's the guy you look at and are like, man you know he was probably so cool in the 80s. He pulls up in his trans-am that's blurring white snake or docking. He's got that perfectly feathered and parted hair. Maybe he's wearing a blazer with shoulder pads that are a little too big. And you know, you can almost like smell the mustiness of the 80s when you see him. And this guy, he's not dressing like this to be ironic. Like he's not some Brooklyn hipster or something. Now what he thinks is, dude, I was the man in high school. I got tons of chicks, I partied, I drove a sweet car, and I still got it. Why change anything? And that, not adapting to the times, is the first thing that makes us older guys look older. The thing about this, and I kind of alluded to it in my funny description of this hypothetical person, is that there's a really strong mental component to all of this. We've all likely had great positive experiences early on in our lives, and it's natural to want to hold on to that. Like, this was a great time in my life. I just want to live here forever. But unfortunately, that's not how it works. We have to move on. We have to evolve. We can't live in the past. Sure, the clothing and hairstyle stuff, that's part of it. But the real issue is being able to mentally move on. Dwelling on past successes, triumphs and positives to the point that it traps you in the past is not a good place to be. Things change and change is hard. Sucks. But we know that change happens and the sooner you can wrap your head around that and learn to consider change as a way to improve yourself and a new challenge to take on to improve yourself then and only then can you start living your best life in the present. Now as we get older there are a lot of changes that happen to us and to our bodies. Most of them are very annoying. Things hurt. I don't recover as quickly. I get tired faster. We kind of accept these things though, and maybe we laugh about it a little bit, but we pretty much understand that these are things that we can't really reverse. But there is one thing that happens as we get older that some of us do try to reverse with the intent of looking younger. However, when we make mistake number two, which is to try to cover up the fact that we're getting some gray hair, we actually make ourselves look even older. I don't know. Maybe there are some really good hair dye products and beard dyeing products out there, but I feel like I can always spot the person who uses them. It just doesn't look natural, it doesn't match up with everything else that I'm seeing in front of me. So it kind of looks like a guy who is trying to cling to his past glory and not accepting that things change. That makes us look and appear older. There's nothing wrong with gray hair or some salt and pepper. You appear more mature, you appear wiser, and in fact, I think a lot of women and men would say that men with gray hair or salt and pepper hair look even more attractive and sexier than guys without any gray. George Clooney, sexy, John Slattery, sexy, Pierce Brosnan, sexy, Brad Pitt, I rest my case. Now let's talk about a mistake that us older guys often make that makes us look older. That is very easy to correct. Now you may have noticed as you've matured that your eyebrows have gotten bushier, your nose hairs have gotten longer, and your ears have spreaded hair of their own. It's natural. It happens. But if you let it go, not only is it kind of gross, but it makes you look like an old man. There are many easy ways to take care of this. For nose hair, there are any number of little grooming devices to choose from or you could use a pair of little scissors but just be careful if you do that. Ear hair, also easy with a grooming device or electric razor, I would caution you if you use a safety razor to shave and you try to use that on your ear because it's very easy to cut yourself and I am speaking from experience. And then as far as your eyebrows, next time you go to the barber, ask them to trim them up. comb over them, go over it with some clippers, and you will look younger. So you've probably heard the saying things get better with age or things get better with time. And that's true of a lot of things like wine, cheese, whiskey, a great pair of jeans, quality leather goods, cast iron skillet. But for most of these things to get better as they age, wine, cheese, and whiskey aside, there's a certain amount of maintenance involved. Taking good care of these things helps them age well and also ensures that you are maximizing their lifespan. The most important thing to understand is that this type of maintenance needs to be regular. It needs to be routine. It's not like you invest in a really nice leather briefcase, use it every day, beat it up real bad, never maintain it or protect it from the elements, and then one day, ten years later, you're like, what happened to this? And is there any way that I can fix it? Because the answer is no. Once you get to a certain point with some things, there is no going back. Now for some things like the leather briefcase example or a pair of shoes or a pair of jeans, it's not really the end of the world if they wear out because we can just replace them with a new briefcase or a new pair of shoes or a new pair of jeans. But when it comes to something really important like your face, well that's not something you can replace. And since it's also the first thing people see when they look at you, if you're not taking care of it, if you're not moisturizing, if you're not using some sort of SPF, if you're not doing that general daily maintenance, those effects are going to snowball out of control and you will end up looking much older than you are. And skincare doesn't have to be a big deal, but you do have to commit to the routine. That is why I'm proud to partner with Teege Hanley, today's video sponsor, because they make the entire process just so easy. So if Teege is new to you, I would recommend starting with their basic plan. With this plan, you're getting all of the important basic things that you need, like a face cleanser, an exfoliating scrub, an AM moisturizer with SPF that'll help protect your skin against the sun, and also a PM moisturizer, which is really important for the repair process that happens while you're sleeping. Since we are talking about things you can do to keep yourself from looking older than you are, I would highly recommend stepping up into Teej's level three system, which is what I've personally been using and loving for over a year. And that one adds in a firming serum and an eye cream. You know, when you get older, there are a lot of things taking up your time. And I've gotten to a point in my life where for certain things, I just need somebody to tell me what to do because I literally don't have time to think about it. So when I get my T-Shandly box and open it up and see that card that tells me what to do, when to do it and how much of the product to use, that itself is worth the price. So in addition to great skin, when you join Teej, you get tons of perks, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, pause or cancel at any time, no hassle refunds, free US shipping, and low-cost shipping to most other countries. And because Teej Handley is sponsoring today's video, they're offering you guys a great deal. Just click the first link in the description and not only will you get Teej Handley for the best possible price, but they'll also give you a free gift with your first box. Click that link to get started for just $30. So a lot of the things we are talking about here have to do with trying to hold onto the past at any cost. But unfortunately, when we do that, we look older than we are. And I would say the one thing, and the one instance where this shows up the most, is when guys start losing their hair. Now, this isn't something that's a problem just for us older guys, because you can start losing your hair at any age. But if you're older and start losing your hair and start trying to cover it up with a little comb over and growing it longer on top to do the comb over, mistake number five, that just makes you look older. There's definitely a mental component to this one as well. You might think you're not as attractive as you were with a full head of hair. You might think that women won't find you attractive anymore and basically it's over. But you know what? You are the only person that cares about this. I've seen friends of mine go through this, and let me tell you, when they finally give in and just go with a tight buzz, or even a complete head shave, they not only look and feel more confident, but they look younger than they did with the old comb over. It's tough, I know, I get it, but as hard as it's going to be, this is a change that you need to embrace. It's gonna be a different look, but I guarantee it will become your look, and you won't look older than you are. So I had this teacher in grad school. He was in his late 60s, good looking guy, smart dresser, but he wore the wrong shoes and it really made him look like an old man. He used to wear these black new balance walking shoes with everything. Now, when you get older, maybe for various reasons, you need some extra comfort when it comes to your shoes. Okay, I get it. But if you're dressing up, mistake number six by the way, in wearing comfort shoes, you're gonna look like an old man. Don't do it. Get a nice pair of dress shoes. They could be Oxfords if your style is dressier, Derby's if you're more casual. But do not wear these comfort shoes when you dress up because that will make you look older. Next, before I get to mistake number seven, I wanna talk a little bit about wardrobe in general. There's a lot of conversation, especially at our age, about dressing age appropriately. Now, what does that even mean? What should someone in their 30s wear? What should someone in their 40s wear? What should someone in their 50s, 60s, or 70s wear? It is 100% a rhetorical question because there's no handbook for this. So when you think about how you dress, you should be asking yourself these questions. How do I want people to see me? Do I prefer to stand out? Or do I prefer to fit in? And finally, and perhaps most importantly, how do I want to feel wearing these clothes? The answers to these questions are way more important than what you quote unquote should be wearing at your age. If you're 20 years old and want to wear a three-piece suit, there's nothing stopping you. No one's going to say, you're too young to be wearing that. Now what kind of stinks is that it really doesn't go the other way. Because mistake number seven that us older guys make, that makes us look older, is wearing trendy things that the kids are wearing. Trying to look younger will make you look older, especially when it comes to younger style trends. So instead of thumbing through the latest GQ for some outfit ideas, try searching through Instagram because there are a lot of older guys who have great style and they look their age. So if you want some recommendations for who to follow, hit me up in the comments. You know what one of the best things about getting older is? Not really caring quite as much anymore. For example, the other night I had on this outfit, my wife took a picture and she asked me if it was okay if she posted it to her Instagram stories. Man, I don't care. People that follow her and follow me would probably think it was funny. I mean, what's the big deal? I'm at home, I want to be comfortable, I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone, though I do think this is a pretty good outfit. I mean, look at it. It's not like I've given up. I'm not dressing like this when I go out like I don't care because Once you stop caring once you kind of give up That will make you look older now I'm not saying you have to walk around with a suit and tie all the time But you should put some effort into how you look and how you dress now. What is the best way to do that? Well, first of all, I'd recommend subscribing to this channel because it's literally what I talk about all the time and And second, check out that playlist I put together for you. So these are outfit ideas that literally anyone can pull off. They're not too dressy, they're not overdone, just things that you could wear every day and feel good about yourself.

        "transcript": " This is not just another run of the mill men's winter essentials video, because instead of just telling you that you need a coat, a scarf and a hat, I'm going to be doing three things a little differently. Number one, I'm going to get very specific with my recommendations. I'm going to tell you why I think these items are the things that you really need. And we'll go a little beyond the usual than some of the items you typically see in these types of roundups. We'll get into all of that right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style. On this channel, I'm all about giving you the advice and inspiration you need to dress well, develop your personal style, and in the process, gain more confidence and transform your life. Winter Essential number one is a gray flannel suit. It's very important to have a suit that matches the season and if you're only going to have just one, I recommend that it is a gray flannel suit. is one of the best and most classic winter fabrics, helps keep you warmer. The gray color is very versatile so you can pair it with a wide variety of shirt and tie combinations. But the best part about a gray flannel suit is that not only are you getting a full suit, but you are also getting a great standalone jacket and pair of pants, which expands the options that you have in your wardrobe exponentially. And that is why a gray flannel suit is my number one winter essential. By the way, If you want some more inspiration on how to wear a gray flannel suit, I've got a video linked right up there. And to shop any of the items I discussed in this video, check out the description below where you will find links to everything. Winter Essential number two is a cashmere sweater. Now like flannel, cashmere is a great fabric for the winter season. It's very soft, it's very warm, and a cashmere sweater is a garment that is instantly going to upgrade your winter style. In terms of types or styles of cashmere sweaters, the one you choose kind of depends on what you're going for. A crew neck is a great casual or more laid back option. You could wear it by itself or easily layer it over a button up shirt for a very simple and classic look. Or you could go with the turtleneck for something a little more elegant and sophisticated. Now, I can hear you through the screen thinking right now, I'd love a cashmere sweater, but they're always so expensive. And that is definitely a problem that comes up. Cashmere is always going to be a little bit pricier, but there are companies like Gobi Cashmere and Falkenery, for example, that do offer less expensive direct to consumer pricing. With a cashmere sweater, you are getting tons of style, sophistication, and a touch of luxury. And that is why it is one of my winter essentials. Winter essential number three is a cozy robe. It's cold outside, which means it's going to be a little colder inside as well, especially when you first wake up in the morning. So having a nice rope to throw on as an extra layer is not only practical in the sense that it helps keep you warm, but it's stylish as well. During the wintertime, I think it's great to have a robe in a seasonal pattern like a tartan plaid. I recommend checking out LL Bean because they have some really great options and they're also very reasonable in terms of price. Now if you're looking for something a little more sartorial, you might opt for what's called a dressing gown. Now a dressing gown is meant to be worn over clothing so it should not be confused with a bathrobe. In addition to being more elegant than regular robes, dressing gowns are generally more expensive than regular robes as well but if you invest in one they are nice to wear around the house this time of year and if you get a really fancy one it's a great way to make an elegant statement at a holiday party or winter cocktail party that you might host. Winter essential Number four is a stylish pair of leather gloves. Typically when guys go to buy a pair of leather gloves, they're gonna go for either a black pair or a brown pair, and that's fine, I recommend that as well. But the style of the glove is often very simple because the simpler the style, the more versatile it's gonna be, right? Not necessarily. Take a look at this pair right here. Has a very intricate and unique woven back, which is such a cool standout detail, but it's subtle enough, especially from a distance, that it doesn't take away from your ability to style them many different ways. For a more casual pair, you might consider something like this. These are made from genuine shearling leather with a warm wool inside and a suede finish outside. If you have a more casual, maybe rugged or outdoorsy style, I think this would be a great pair of gloves for you. Winter Essential number five is a dinner jacket and or a smoking jacket. So around the holidays, although they've passed now, it's always a great time to dress up more formally. Typically when wearing formal wear, I would recommend keeping it pretty simple and not calling attention to yourself. But during the winter time, during the holidays, it's always nice to have a little more fun and be a little more festive. There are two ways that I like to do that, and the first is with color. Burgundy is a great color for a dinner jacket. It's perfect for the holidays, perfect for the winter time, and it's definitely something that you could wear for other formal occasions throughout the year. Second is to choose a velvet fabric and opt for a slightly more eccentric smoking jacket style. Here I've got on a double breasted, Shawl lapel version with great piping details around the button closures, on the sleeves, and on the edge of the lapel. This is a brand new item that I'm super excited about having in the shop now, and you can check it out for yourself with the link down in the description. Winter Essential number six is a silk scarf. A silk scarf is a great elegant alternative to a wool scarf or a cashmere scarf. The fabric is much thinner than wool or cashmere, so you have a lot more options in terms of how you can tie it and how you can style it. For example, you can easily wear it practically for warmth under your coat, but it also makes for a really elegant accent with a suit or tuxedo. Personally, I love a silk scarf with a simple polka dot pattern. It's just so classic and timeless. Navy is a great choice for the most versatility. Black, if you plan to wear it more with your formal wear. And burgundy is always a great choice for the holiday season. Winter essential number seven is a casual, warm coat. Even though we've been talking about sort of, you know, next level style items here, I do think it's important to have a really good casual coat. In other words, a coat that's not an overcoat. Obviously, we want one in a thick, warm fabric, and my pick for the best casual yet very stylish winter coat is the Venerable Peacote. Most classic version of this is the Navy Peacote, which is extremely versatile, but if you're interested in something classic that's a little different, I would choose something like this in a brown tone. It's just as versatile as Navy, but quite unexpected and very stylish. essential number eight is some all-weather footwear. Now you might think, based on my selection so far, that I'm gonna say you need to get a pair of Hunter boots, but that is not the case. I mean, don't get me wrong, Hunter boots look great in all those idyllic heritage brand men walking together in their best tweed through the hillsides and mud of Scotland photos, but that's not reality. And I've come to the realization that as much as I might want to pretend that that is my life, it's not. So it's not practical. What is practical, however, is what is my favorite pair of all-weather footwear, the Never Out of Style Bean Boot from LL Bean. I actually have three pairs. I have the mox, I have the gum shoes, and I have the eight-inch boots. Between those three, I'm covered whether I've just got to run out to let the dog do her business, split and gather some firewood from the backyard, or shovel several inches of snow from the driveway. Now from utility to luxury, we have winter essential number nine, a pair of house slippers. And here I'm not talking about your regular old clunky slippers. No. Here we are talking about a more classic, sleek, and old school style of slipper. Something like the Crockett and Jones ritz which is a quilted lined mule with a soft leather upper and sole or if you know you're not a fan of the mule style my personal favorite is the Belgian shoe Mr. Casual in wool and my favorite pair to wear in the winter is this pair right here in black watch plaid. These types of slippers or house shoes look and feel much more refined and that is why they are one of my winter essentials. One of One of the great ways to stand out from the crowd during any season is to have a unique version of a garment that everyone is wearing, which is why Winter Essential number 10 is a statement overcoat, and I'm choosing this particular overcoat right here. First thing that stands out, obviously, is the pattern. It's a big and bold houndstooth check, and I feel like patterns like this are great during the winter because they provide a big contrast to what is typically a more minimal and bleak landscape. This coat is made from a thick wool and also has a quilted inner lining so it's a very warm coat and it has a few more subtle details that help make it even more unique and special like the Prussian collar, raglan sleeves, hidden button closures that go all the way up to the neck and sleeve tabs. This coat along with all the other items I mentioned in this video are linked below in the description and if you're looking for more ways to upgrade your winter style I've I've got a playlist for you right up there. It's filled with outfit ideas, wardrobe recommendations, and reviews of some of the best menswear you can find. So go ahead and click there to keep taking your winter style to the next level."

        "transcript": " Let me start off by sharing a comment that I got on the channel recently. So this comment came in from a guy named Lucas and Lucas writes, You probably are living on your parents' money. That's why you are saying that expensive things are better. Hold on a second Lucas, because number one, I've been serving active duty in the United States Army for 18 and a half years. And number two, I've been running a successful business on the side for nine years. But thank you for making such an inane assumption about me. Now all of you who aren't Lucas are probably wondering why I'm even bringing this up and calling this dude out in this video. Well the reason is, is because it's a story that leads me to talk about trait number one, which is that confident guys take action. They do things. They get stuff done. And I'm not talking about the fact that I confronted this guy and responded to his comment, which by the way has since been removed. What I'm talking about is the fact that I started a business, I did it even though some people thought no joke that it was the stupidest idea in the world and I haven't been afraid to experiment and try different things as the business has grown. Now, you might wonder like, how did I even do this? This being, he spoke style, like, how did I start it? How did I get it off the ground, how do I keep it going? Those are great questions, but I'm going to tell you those are the wrong questions to ask. Now, I know I'm using myself as an example, but what I'm talking about applies to you because you don't get anything done like that, like a big dream that you have without possessing trait number two, which is having a vision. Now a vision goes beyond what you're going to do and how you're going to do it. Having a vision means understanding why you are doing something. If you don't understand that, you can only take whatever it is you're going to do so far. What you should know about this though is that for most of us, this doesn't come easy. It's a muscle that you have to learn to exercise. And for those of you who are looking to exercise that muscle, the book that I always recommend to get you started on that journey is Start With Why by Simon Sinek. So let me tell you one thing that like, you know, when you see someone that successful, you kind of automatically think like they've got it all figured out, right? They have that vision. They're doing it. They're getting it done. They're successful. And from the outside looking in, it's easy to think that it's effortless, like some kind of magic, like this person has the magic touch and whatever they do is a success. It's freaking annoying, right? Because you've had some great ideas, but for whatever reason, it hasn't worked out yet. So the thing is that successful people have been in that situation before also. They have failed, and probably more than once, but one of the traits of successful and confident guys, and we're on trait number three if you're keeping track, is that they're not afraid to fail. Your first idea and your first execution of something I'm sorry will probably not work. I wish I could say that he spoke style was my first idea that I ever had, but that is not true. So I used to run a website called Bags and Trees, which was basically just a blog that had pictures of plastic bags caught in trees, and that celebrated the beauty of that phenomenon. It was completely a parody and social commentary website, and I just basically stopped it because I got tired of getting angry emails from environmentalists not getting the joke and telling me what a piece of I was And I also ran for a while a site called the serialist which was basically the onion of classical music started on the premise that classical music needed to loosen up a little bit and Learn to laugh at itself if it wanted to reach more people and not be a dying art form so that site lasted for two weeks and and we actually took it down after getting some cease and desist letters from big opera star publicists, which basically just proved our initial hypothesis that classical musicians take themselves way too seriously. I could keep going down the list of failures that I've had here, but I think you get the point. Do you know what else confident guys do? They respect themselves, which means that they take care of themselves, trait number four. They exercise and maintain their bodies. They eat well and are conscious of how they feel themselves. They take care of their grooming to make sure that their appearance shows that they take care of themselves. All of these things, exercising, eating, grooming can seem complicated if you're just starting to maybe get into them. But I think of the three for guys, grooming can be the worst. That's why for grooming stuff, I always turn to Teach Hanley, today's video sponsor, because they make the whole grooming process super simple and let me show you just how simple they make it. Box comes, I open it up, there's a card, it tells me exactly what to do, when to do it and how much of the product to use. Everything comes together so I'm not buying a whole bunch of win-offs and maybe forgetting something. All you really need to get started is Teej's basic plan. You've got a face cleanser and exfoliating scrub and AM moisturizer with SPF. important to protect your skin from the sun and a PM moisturizer to help prepare your skin throughout the night. Personally though, I add in two other products and bump it up to their level three system which includes a firming serum and an eye cream.

Just click the first link in the description and not only will you get Tish Hanley for the best possible price, but they'll also give you a free gift with your first box. So click that link to get started for just $30. Okay, so the next trait of confident guys is another sort of mindset. So let's say that you reach a milestone of some sort or that after working really hard at something or towards something, you finally meet that goal. It could be anything like setting a personal record for running or cycling or lifting weights or getting some type of professional certification. What do you do when you reach that goal? Some guys will be like, I did that, I win. Done. But highly confident guys will be like, okay, but how can I go even further? Because confident guys push themselves, constantly wanting to be even better than however amazing it was that they just did. And that is as soon as the goal is achieved, the mind is already thinking about what it's going to take to get to that next level. And that sort of thinking requires another kind of thinking, trait number six, which is that confident men think positive. If you're not believing that you can do something and thinking positively, even if you fail, which you will, then you will not appear as confident. And that is all I'm going to say about that. Now let me tell you something else about confident guys. Confident guys know that they don't know everything, which means that they have trait number seven, that they are open to learning, which also means that they possess trait number eight, that they are not afraid to ask questions. Think about it. If you don't know how to do something, are you going to pretend that you know how to do it? Because if you're pretending, you're not really going to feel that confident. Next. So, okay, you know when you're at like a party year with a big group of people and there's that one guy who's like, hey everyone pay attention to me. I'm the loudest person talking so I'm important. Ha ha ha ha. I'm going to make fun of you and make everyone laugh. Do you really think that guy is confident? Now he may appear confident but underneath all of that, that guy is super insecure. The confident guy, now he displays trait number nine which is that he doesn't need to be heard. Listen, guys that are constantly talking loudly and trying to get you to listen to them almost has the opposite effect. Like you've got all this stuff coming at you that you kinda start to not hear anything anymore. You just kinda tune it out because nothing really means anything. But when the confident guy who, you know, doesn't really say much, finally says something, you listen. Now for trait number 10, let me just pose a hypothetical situation here. So let's say that there's this guy who, I don't know, like maybe nine years ago started a men's style blog. And then over time that became successful. There's an Instagram account too. There's even a YouTube channel. And there are lots of people who like what he does and they like him. But then there are some people who freaking hate him, like despise this guy, Even to the point of giving every new video a thumbs down within 10 seconds of it being posted. But you know, the guy with this website and Instagram and YouTube channel, he doesn't care because of trait number 10, that he knows that he cannot please everyone. If you're trying to please everyone, you're watering down your message and what you stand for. Successful brands, successful and confident guys have haters. The pagans make you stronger. So don't try to please everyone. You'll be more confident, more powerful, and more successful once you realize that not everyone's going to love you. So I've used myself as an example for a few of these 10 traits that we've been talking about. And you might think that because of that, that I am a supremely confident person all the time. What I want you to know is that this is not the case. And thinking about these things is something that I do over and over and over again to work on my own confidence. Point is that this is something that you can develop. Nobody has all of these trades without working on them and putting in some effort. And knowing myself, I would say that if I can do it, I definitely know that you can too. Thanks once again to Teege Hanley for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " What do you think about when you think about winter style? Sh**, it was full! Hopefully that's not it. Now, for me, I think about great outerwear, cozy sweaters, heavier fabrics, textures, and the color white. Wait a second, you're saying white? Hey, does white work in the winter? Well, I'll tell you why I think it does, show you how to do it, and show you some more of my favorite winter jackets, sweaters, and accessories right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa. You're watching He Spoke Style, and on this channel, I teach you the principles of dressing well and give you the tools and inspiration you need to develop your personal style. For this first look here, I was thinking about two things when I put it together. I was thinking about what you might wear to a holiday party, and I was thinking about what you might wear if you were going to visit family and wanted to look nice, but not, you know, kind of going overboard. So color palette here with browns and blues, and I'll admit not very festive for the season, but you know, still classic and kind of casually cool and dapper. Navy chinos, brown gingham shirt, and then layered over the shirt, we have a really cool striped and textured crew neck sweater in kind of a dark camel or caramel color from Express, who is today's video sponsor. I'm going to feature one piece from Express in each of today's looks, and many of the pieces like this particular sweater, for example, are currently on sale. And links to all of the featured items will be down below in the description. So one of the things that I think is tough when it comes to putting together winter outfits is dealing with with outerwear. You know, like if you build your wardrobe around your outerwear, sometimes, especially if it's a standout piece, like this leather jacket, when you take your jacket off, the outfit might not feel as complete. That's one big reason why I like layering a sweater over a button-up shirt, because even without a jacket, it still looks finished, and it does have a more casual and relaxed feel than if you were wearing a sport coat or something like that. And we're gonna stay on the topic of outerwear here with the next look, this look completely revolves around this Express Brown Peacote, which by the way is currently on sale for 50% off. Brown obviously is a color that I have a great love for. And this Peacote just looks and feels so rich and elevated, both in the color and the slight texture that it has as well. So I really wanted to keep that casually sophisticated feel with the rest of the outfit. And that's why I chose a white cashmere turtleneck and paired it with some charcoal flannel pants, as well as a pair of lace-up dress boots. I really like how the color kind of progresses from the top of the outfit with the colors being lighter and they get darker as your eye moves down the outfit. I think it does a good job of what a good outfit should do and that is to frame your face. Anytime I do have an outfit like this with this kind of casual sophisticated feel, I do like to wear eyeglasses. I just think it really kind of elevates and complements and completes the entire look. All right, now we're going to be moving away from the I've got an event to go to and wanna step up my game looks into a couple of outfits that would fall more into the category of what I really wear every day. Side note, if you haven't checked out the video where I do show you what I really wear every day, be sure to watch it and it's linked right up there. Onto the outfit now, here it is. Super basic foundation of a Heather Gray athletic sweatshirt and light wash denim jeans. Whenever I'm dealing with pieces that are so simple, I always try to think of ways to make the outfit more interesting. And typically in the wintertime, that's through texture and pattern. So for texture, we have this quilted vest. And then for pattern, I layered in a short scarf. Now I like to have a couple shorter scarves because sometimes I'm truly not wearing it to keep me warm, but more like to add in an accent like I'm doing here. And if you have a regular length scarf, you can't really do this because it's gonna be hanging down below the jacket and it's just gonna throw off the whole balance of the look. And then speaking of balance, I really do think a hat adds a measure of balance to winter looks and I love baseball caps. And this hat that I have here from Express is actually wool, so definitely very seasonally appropriate. So no, I haven't forgotten about what I promised to talk about, which is why I think white is a perfectly acceptable color to wear in the winter. We're gonna get to that in just a bit, but first we need to talk about this look and specifically this Express Moleskine shirt jacket. I love the dark brown color, of course, super comfortable. It's actually very light, so that makes it a great layering piece. And the best part, if you find yourself liking it as much as I do, is that currently it is available for 40% off. Shirt jackets are sort of those great in between pieces. You know, they're kind of rugged, but depending on how you style them, you can kind of dress it up a bit. I tried to have it both ways here with the jeans and wool beanie, more casual, and the denim shirt layered sweater and oxblood boots, making it more dressy. Okay, so wearing white in the winter. Now, first of all, the whole don't wear white after Labor Day rule, that's stupid, worst rule ever. So I think white in the winter time is great because it's unexpected, it has an elevated and sophisticated feel, the coolness of the white color matches the season. Wait, is white actually a color? And it's a blank canvas that you can literally pair any color you want with, so there are immense possibilities. For this look, however, what I wanted to do was to lean into the elevated and sophisticated part of what I was just talking about. So very casually cool and sophisticated with white denim and a very simple white and brown color palette. I love this Express Ribb Turtle Neck Sweater in a light camel color. It's chunky, it just has a very luxurious feel to it. And these light camels and whites for some reason to me always project a sense of luxury and sophistication. That, of course, goes for the B3 bomber jacket with the shearling collar and cuffs on the sleeves. And then I added in another touch of luxury with some suede in my belt and also in the dark brown Chukka boots. Thanks once again to Express for sponsoring this video and reminder that I've got links to the Crewneck sweater, the Pico wool baseball hat, moleskin shirt jacket and chunky rib turtleneck down below in the description. If you want some more winter outfit inspiration, I've got a playlist for you to click right over there."

        "transcript": " You know, I think some of you might have the wrong idea about me. Specifically about how I dress. Now, I know that on the channel I do a lot of videos about suits and more dressed up styles, like a lot of videos, but you know what? I don't actually wear those things every single day. Well, that brings up a lot of questions, right? Like, why do I have all these clothes? The reason is that I like them. They make me feel good. They are my personal style, and I wear them whenever I have an opportunity to. I choose to wear clothes like that, but that's not every single day. You know, it'd be kind of weird if I was out in the yard with the dog in a tuxedo. So that's why today I wanted to put together this video and show you five of my everyday outfits. I'm Brian Sacawa and you're watching He Spoke Style. On this channel I teach you the principles of dressing well and give you the tools and inspiration you need to develop your personal style. So what I'm going to do is for each outfit I'm going to show you each individual piece and then we'll put it together so you can see the outfit as a whole. I'll put links to everything that is available down below in the description and in the event that the exact item isn't available, I will do my best to link to something similar. Here we go. For look number one, I've got a Lavinum quilted jacket. It's a classic, great sort of light to midway piece of outerwear. Next a Buffalo plaid flannel shirt. This is by Uniqlo. Great pattern and color for the season. Jeans are by double RL. Oatmeal colored wool knit hat by Drake's. And then for footwear, I've got some Bostonian oxblood leather boots. When you put it together, you've got an outfit that is kind of outdoorsy, rugged, very much sort of what I've been feeling in our new environment, living out here in the woods. All these pieces I have had for no less than three years, I think the least old piece in this outfit is the shirt. Just goes to show you that if you fill your wardrobe great basics, they will always look good. Look number two starts off with this Todd Snyder for LL Bean Sherpa jacket. I freaking love this piece. The Todd Snyder LL Bean stuff is amazing. Unfortunately, this particular shirt jacket is sold out. However, there is an even cooler version, I would say, available now that is a kind of really big black, gray, and tan check. Let me tell you, if I didn't already have this one, I would totally have that one. Next, just a simple baseball shirt, which is actually over 10 years old. Light wash jeans, J Crew, 484 fit, a wool baseball cap, which is by Express, and then a pair of LL Bean Campmocks, which are pretty much my everyday shoes these days. So this really is the go outside play with the dog in the yard look. It's definitely been getting much colder lately and this shirt jacket is just so warm not to mention ridiculously comfortable. So a lot of what I wear on a day-to-day basis is just really functional. I know I can just grab the shirt jacket and I'll be warm. The camp mocks are just so easy to slip on and off. I mean this is just like such a classic fall winter casual outfit for me. So you've probably noticed a couple of LL Bean items in this video and if you follow the channel for a while, I think this is the first time that I've ever worn pieces by LL Bean on the channel. So this is 100% not sponsored by LL Bean, but I have really been loving the brand recently and I've kind of rediscovered them for myself. Comfortable, casual, classic, stylish really fits the bill for how my personal style has been evolving over the years. So for this next look, just kind of a variation on the last one. And all I've really done is to swap out the Sherpa shirt jacket for this fleece lined flannel shirt. So this is a size medium. They call it slightly fitted. I think it fits great in the shoulders though, perhaps just a little baggy around the body for my taste, but I do only have a t-shirt on underneath. So there's definitely room to layer in a thicker sweater. if I wanted to wear this, if it was cooler out. Again, just a really easy outfit to throw on for some yard work, splitting wood, or playing with the dog. For this next look, this is an indoor outfit. I've got a Cableknit Cashmere Cartigan by Gobi Cashmere. Great brand, great product, great prices. Definitely check them out if you're in the market for some high quality, yet affordable cashmere pieces. Then, plaid flannel from J Crew Factory. Same J Crew Lightwash 484 jeans seen in the last two looks. And my favorite shoes to wear around the house for the season, these are Wool Black Watch plaid loafers by Belgian Shoes. I'm definitely one of those people who struggles to find outfits to wear just around the house that aren't too dressy, but then again, aren't just super sloppy like t-shirt and sweatpants. So this is pretty much my go-to when it comes to an in-between at home outfit. The plaid flannel is super comfortable. The cardigan kind It kind of gives you that blazer feel, but it's much more cozy, definitely more casual. Yeah, so just super easy to throw on, feel good, and feel like I'm actually put together, but not too much when I'm at home. Look number five is super sporty. We have a Lululemon jacket, a Lululemon shirt, some Lululemon ABC joggers, and two other pieces for this outfit, simple white baseball hat by Vilberken, and white leather sneakers by Common Projects. So yeah, pretty simple, very sporty. And just let me say that I would have never considered myself a nice leisure kind of guy, but the Lululemon stuff, although admittedly is definitely a bit on the pricier side, it's just so comfortable, it fits so well. So I am definitely a fan. I do have another pair of these joggers, which are the cropped shorter version. The ones I'm wearing are the regular. Wasn't sure I was gonna like the regular length as much, but I definitely do. So for those of you who have been wondering what I wear on a daily basis, these five outfits are that. It's all about comfort, practicality, utility, and of course, I always try to pick things that have a little bit of style as well. I've got links down below to as many of the pieces featured in this video as possible, and some more winter casual outfit ideas right over there in that video. So click there for some more casual winter outfit inspiration."

        "transcript": " As you're building your wardrobe, one of the things I think you really need to have and that your wardrobe is simply incomplete without is a great leather jacket. It's a classic piece of outerwear. It looks so cool and it makes you feel like a badass. Now there are a variety of styles of leather jackets out there and in this video I'm going to be sharing three of my favorites and showing you how to style them. I'm Brian Sacawa, you're watching He Spoke Style, and if you are looking to dress well and have more confidence, you have come to the right place because on this channel, I will teach you how to do that and I will show you how to do that. Now one of the things that I think holds people back from purchasing a quality leather jacket is that they're kind of expensive. So if you're put off by that and then you start looking at cheaper, more fast fashion oriented brands, something more inexpensive, and if you're like me, you start thinking, this isn't the quality that I would want to wear. The reason that a lot of these luxury branded leather jackets are so expensive is, yes, you have the name brand, but then you've also got the long supply chain of distributors, wholesalers and retailers and then when you add the marketing costs on top of that you come up with a really inflated price for a garment that honestly shouldn't cost that much. That's why I was really excited to discover the Jacket Maker, today's video sponsor, because their mission is to make quality leather jackets accessible to everyone. And there are five key things that the Jacket Maker promises to you as a consumer. Number one is that their jackets use the finest raw materials. All of their jackets are made with full grain natural leather as well as YKK zippers. And because the leather is such a high quality, you will see less joints and panels in all of their jackets, which makes them feel better when you wear them and gives them an overall much nicer appearance. Number two is their attention to detail and craftsmanship. All of their products are handmade one at a time by one craftsman giving you an attention to detail that you will not find in any mass produced garment. Number three is fair pricing. With the jacket makers direct to consumer model and just in time production, their garments come in at one quarter of the price of what luxury brands would sell them for. Number four is sizing that fits everyone. Now I understand you hear the word inclusivity thrown around a lot these days, but it is something that this brand takes quite seriously. All of the jacket makers outerwear is offered in eight standard sizes from extra small all the way up to 4XL and they also offer a made-to-measure option for only an extra $30. And number five is actually discovery and personal expression. So the jacket maker does offer a bespoke service and if you have something in mind that you know maybe you've had difficulty finding off the rack the jacket maker can do that for you. The prices are absolutely fantastic and the quality is also exceptional. So if you've been looking to add a leather jacket to your fall winter wardrobe, I highly recommend checking out the jacket maker. I've got links down below in the description to the jacket maker website as well as all three of the jackets I'll be featuring in this video. And speaking of the jackets I'll be featuring in this video, we're going to jump into that right now. I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of each and then jump into how I would style it. Up first we've got the classic Francis B3 bomber. One of the things I love about this is the leather finish. It's distressed which gives it a really unique look and actually makes it appear very similar to a double-faced leather. Inside it is fully faux fur aligned which is of course very soft and warm and you've got that classic B3 style with two outer pockets, waist adjustment straps, buckled collar, and the rollback cups. Now this is a really easy jacket to style in what I would call a kind of really classic way like black t-shirt, black jeans, black Chelsea boots, but I wanted to do something a little different and here it is. So as you can see I went the complete opposite direction and opted for whites and creams. I've got a cream colored turtleneck, paired with some white denim, cream colored socks pulling in the color of the turtle neck and also creating some contrast with the jeans and then finished off with some suede tassel loafers which balance the whole look nicely with the color of the jacket. Whites and lighter colors like this in the winter always to me appear very elegant, refined and a much fresher take on styling such a classic leather jacket like this. And of course to finish it off a bomber jacket really does need a big aviator style pair of sunglasses. Without these, looks kind of incomplete to me. Up next, we've got the Lavendard Leather Biker Jacket. Now, I love this jacket's simplicity. If you're looking for a kind of do-anything, very versatile leather jacket, this is the one I would choose. It's an oil pull-up leather finish, which has a nice kind of two-tone shade, and it's cowhide, which means it's thick and durable, going to last for a very long time. I talked about it being simple. It's got two outside pockets and one zipped breast pocket. I like the size of the collar and then inside it's got a quilted lining for some extra warmth. Now again with each of my stylings of these leather jackets I tried to do something a little different than you would expect and here I wanted to show you how you could incorporate a leather jacket with some of your dressier outfits and that is why simplicity matters because A leather jacket with lots of extra zippers or quilting just isn't going to match with a more dressed up look whereas something like this does appear a lot more seamless. Speaking of simplicity, the outfit itself is very simple. White button-up shirt, charcoal flannel pants, black grenadine tie, and black leather oxfords. I did deliberately keep the colors darker to play into the expectations that you would have when you see a leather jacket. This to me, you know, as we're coming into the holiday season is a great look for any sort of holiday party that you may attend. Jacket number three is what is called the sheriff jacket. This is made with really high quality suede. It is extremely soft and supple. It's also made with very large panels which is a testament to the quality of the leather. It's got a high collar, two outside pockets, to inside pockets and is fully lined with a faux fur, which makes it just incredibly warm. For this one, I decided to go with a brown tonal look. I've got kind of a coffee with milk colored cashmere crew next sweater, cream colored cotton trousers, brown leather belt, brown socks, and brown loafers. Dressing tonally like this is one of my absolute favorite things, particularly in in the fall and winter time. I love to play around with different seasonal tones and much like the first look, I think it projects a casual elegance that really helps you stand out. Once you think the jacket maker once again for sponsoring this video, reminder that I have links down in the description to the jacket maker site, as well as each individual jacket featured. Now, they also have tons of other styles, so be sure to click the link to check out their complete selection."

        "transcript": " I have to tell you guys what's been going on because honestly, it's been a little crazy. It's been exciting. It's been challenging and it has been a little frustrating at times. So if you do follow me on Instagram, you may have noticed that two months ago, Robin and I bought a new house. Very exciting. We loved our old place, but we're looking for something that had a yard that we could fence in for a cocoa and just generally a little more privacy and kind of away from thing so we sort of live in the woods now. Anyway there were things we wanted to do as soon as we moved in of course kind of make the home our own and the two biggest things were getting the whole house painted and redoing the basement to make the studio. So we had the best painters they were ridiculously meticulous they spent a week just sanding the walls and patching everything up and making them perfect before doing any of the trim the ceilings or putting any paint on the walls themselves. So like these are the kind of painters that you want because you know they're doing it right, but it does take a while to do work like that and it was like two weeks before we could start having some semblance of putting the house back together. Now the basement slash studio where I'm at right now. So I kind of need to set the stage for you and talk about what the basement actually was when we moved in. So I mean, it wasn't terrible, terrible. Like you could do stuff down here, but it just hadn't been updated in a very long time. The walls were all marked up and stuff. The floor in the main area was this 1980s big brown porcelain tile. There was a really nasty dirty carpet in the other room, which is now becoming my office. There was also a kind of 1980s-ish bar that we weren't really into. so some stuff that needed to be done. I decided that to save some money that I was gonna demo the floors myself and ripping up the carpet was pretty easy. The porcelain tile, not so much. So I went and rented a 20 pound demo hammer, got all suited up and spent one Sunday ripping up all that tile. And now I'm going to make a really long story short for the purposes of this video and tell you that eventually six weeks after we moved into the house, finally the luxury vinyl flooring that I had ordered got installed. So there was like a month and a half where there was no studio, everything was in boxes. And just now we are starting to unpack everything, piece it together, decide where everything's going to go, set it up, make everything efficient, test it out, dial it in. it's a process and I definitely underestimated how involved everything was going to be, how long it was going to take and I'm just so ready to get back into a schedule. Because honestly that has been the hardest part about this whole moving process. I am such a routine and schedule-based person and when I'm in a good groove there's nothing that can stop me but when that gets turned upside down I struggle. I don't know if it's just me or Or if other people experience the same thing when it comes to that, but I just love routines because they center me, they get me focused, they put my mind in the right place. And there's sort of like a comfort in having something that you do every single day, especially if it's contributing to your overall well-being. And now the title of this video is starting to make sense. You knew that I was going to bring it back to this, right? So knowing that I do not handle changes in routine very well, I very deliberately focused on having a great 30 minute morning routine because nothing else that was going on for the past couple months has been routine. Painters in the house for two weeks, basement construction zone, wrangling contractors, if you've ever had to do that, I'm sorry. But this, the routine was something that was completely within my control and that would center me and put me on a good path for the day and that is what I'm gonna share with you in this video. And be sure to stick around to the end of the video because I will give you a little bit of a tour around the current state of the studio. So my perfect 30 minute morning routine starts like this. After I wake up, I head downstairs and I drink a big glass of water. This is something I've been doing for many, many years now and the thing I like most about drinking a big glass of water in the morning is that after I drink it instantly I feel more awake and that is exactly what you want to feel in the morning. Next you know, gotta take the dog out to do her business and after that I will go inside and make some coffee. You know although the glass of water doesn't spark to help wake me up I still need a little bit more of a kick. Personally I'm a fan of pour over so I do use a Chemex every morning and I'm very particular about the ratio of coffee to water. So I always use 21 grams of coffee beans to 350 grams of water. Makes one perfect cup and it always tastes great. After that it is breakfast time. I know in the past I've talked about this particular oatmeal recipe that I like but recently I've kind of been keeping it very simple. Just a cup of Greek yogurt about half a cup of granola and some honey on top. Next It's onto personal hygiene, so brushing my teeth, rinsing with mouthwash, flossing, and then it is onto the shower, which includes, in addition to hair washing and body washing, one of the most important rituals of the day, the skincare routine. Now some of us find it difficult to commit to a skincare routine, but nesting it within your morning routine is one of the best ways to make sure that you are making it one of your daily habits. to take care of your face because that is the first thing people see. I get it. You know, skincare can seem like a bit of a mystery and kind of complicated, but that is why I love Teesh Handley, a brand I'm proud to partner with again as a sponsor for today's video because they really do take all the guesswork out of skincare and make it completely uncomplicated. And let me show you what I'm talking about. When you open up the box, the first thing you see is this card right here telling you exactly what you need to do, when to do it, and how much of the product you need to use. Another thing that I love is that you get everything together. There's no need to buy one thing and then another thing and then another thing because that gets complicated. Everything here is all together. Now, all you really need to get started is their basic plan, which includes a face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, and AM and PM moisturizers. And you may be wondering why you need two different moisturizers. So the AM moisturizer contains SPF, which you need throughout the day to keep your skin protected from the sun. And then the PM moisturizer is formulated to maximize the repair process that goes on throughout the night. Now, that's all you need, but I'm a little older, just turned 44 not too long ago. So I like to add a couple of other things into my routine. And that's why I like the Tish Handley level three system, which includes a firming serum and an eye cream. Having been using this stuff religiously for close to a year now, I can 100% say that it works. And I am not just saying that, I can literally see and feel a difference. With Tish Handley, obviously you're getting amazing benefits to your skin. And when you join Tish, you also get access to tons of perks, including at least 20% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box, shipping reminders, the option to pause or cancel at any time, no hassle refunds and free US shipping.

Just click the first link in the description and not only will you get Tige Handley for the best possible price, but they'll also give you a free gift with your first box. Click that link to get started for just $30. So after the shower and after the skincare, there really isn't much left other than combing my hair and getting dressed. Now I can't stress enough how important I think it is to have a solid morning routine to get yourself ready for the day, to get yourself centered, and to get yourself looking good. promised, let's give you a little walkthrough of the current state of the studio and my office. Okay, so here we go into the new studio. studio. So one of the best things about this is that we have a lot more space than we had previously and my office is not part of the production area which definitely I'm a fan of. So one of the problems that we had faced in the old studio was that we had a place to shoot video and we had a place to shoot photos except the space was so small that it was hard to do that. We wanted to to have a place where we could have the lights just set up all the time. So that's what we're doing over here. So this main area here, that's where you're going to be seeing all the outfit videos. And then you can see that we have our lights set up. And then up here, we attached the seamless paper. We actually put a board into the studs and on the bulkhead and then attached that. So because it is pretty heavy. So now we can do that easily transition to shooting photos as well. There's a mirror back there. So over here is the storage area. That's where all the cords and stuff like that is. And then over here now where I used to talk at the desk, not going to happen. I'm going to want to keep the um I want to keep the lights and cameras out of my office. I want that to just be a peaceful place where I can do work. So over here is where I'm going to be shooting most of the talking. We'll also kind of double as a place for B-roll as well. Work in progress. So still a lot of things to put away and things like that. Over here I did set up a nice little gallery wall of some of our photos, well not our photos, but photos that I've had in the studio. And then over here could have been another scene for shooting, but this is going to be a family area, kind of like a hangout. We might put a bar, a couch, just cocktails, something like that. Cool place to go hang out. So let's go into the office. I'll show you that. So fair warning, it is a complete disaster. a lot of stuff still to put away, but and a lot of stuff to take to the dump because previous owners left a lot of things. So this is the office now. It's nice to have my own spot to do my work. Doesn't look like much at all. New uniform right there. So yeah, that is a little bit of a glimpse into what the studio looks like. I will be excited to show you more as we continue to renovate, get things situated, and set up. So thanks once again to Teej Hanley for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " In an effort to look and feel your best, there are two big things that you need to do. The first thing is one that I'm pretty sure everyone understands, and that is to dress well because your style tells people something about you. The second thing is something that I think people might tend to overlook and that is to take care of your grooming because that tells people that you care. We want to make sure we're doing the right things though, so to help you dial that in And today I'm going to go over eight common grooming mistakes that guys make. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. The first grooming mistake that guys make is not balding gracefully. Listen, losing your hair at any age is a huge change and one that can weigh really heavily on you. You might think I'm getting old now or I'm not going to be as attractive as I was with the full head of hair. So you start doing things to kind of hide it, combing over the bald spot you're getting, wearing a hat more often, basically trying as hard as you can to hang on to what you previously had. I think the thing about balding though is that it means more to you than it does to everyone else. Personally, friends I've seen go through this look so much better and more confident when they embrace what's happening and just get rid of their hair. It could be a really tight buzz with the clippers or it could be a complete head shave. As hard as it's going to be, you have to embrace this change, lean into it, it will become your look and you will just look and feel more confident when you commit to letting go of that hair you're losing. Grimming mistake number two that guys make is using too much product and here I'm actually going to combine both hair products and fragrance. So we've all seen the guy with too much hair gel in his hair and we've all certainly smelled the dude who wears way too much cologne. Hope that's not you. Now I've heard some people say before that there's a fine line between getting it just right and overdoing it. I don't necessarily agree with that. In my opinion, subtlety is always best. You want your hair to look natural, not matted in big clumps and super shiny and in terms of fragrance, I think it should be intriguing. It should invite people in for more, not repel them immediately. Alright, so for the third grooming mistake that guys make, what I'll say first is that I totally understand why people make this mistake because it's something you have to do towards the end of the night and after a long day, you're tired, you're completely tapped out. All you want to do is to get into bed and go to sleep, but if you are not doing this one thing, you are making a huge mistake. And that one thing is failing to wash and moisturize your face at night. Of course, we all do this every morning because it's part of our routine, but you really need to make washing and moisturizing your face part of your nighttime routine as well. You're going to get rid of all that stuff that's built up on your face throughout the day and moisturizing is critically important because when you're sleeping, that is when your skin is repairing itself and recovering. Getting Getting into a skincare routine like this is super easy, especially if you know exactly what to do. And that is one of the reasons why I love Teej Hanley, a brand I'm proud to partner with as a sponsor for today's video as a skincare solution because they make it so easy and uncomplicated. I mean, here's what I'm talking about. When you open up the box, the first thing you see is a card telling you exactly what to do and when. All you really need is their basic plan, which includes a face cleanser, exfoliating scrub, AM and PM moisturizer. And I know we're talking about nighttime skincare routine here, but the AM moisturizer also has SPF, which you'll need throughout the day to be protected from the sun. Personally, because I'm a 43-year-old guy, I like to kind of take it up a notch. So I always opt for the Teige Hanley Level 3 system, which also adds in a firming serum and eye cream. I've been using Teej religiously for about nine months now, and I have to tell you that the difference I see and feel in my skin is absolutely incredible. And I'm not just saying that. Go back and watch some of my old videos from about a year ago, and you'll definitely pick up on what I'm putting down. Now in addition to amazing benefits to your skin, when you join Teej Hanley, you get access to tons of perks as well, including 25% off the retail price, the ability to customize your box shipping reminders the option to pause or cancel at any time no hassle refunds and free us shipping and for my international viewers tige does offer low-cost shipping to most countries and because tige handley is sponsoring today's video they're offering you guys a great deal just click the first link in the description and not only will you get tige handley for the best possible price but they'll also give you a free gift with your first box. So click that link to get started for just $25. Okay, moving on to grooming mistake number four, and this I would say is kind of an affliction for those who are really trying to keep their costs down and be economical. And I'm talking about not changing your razor blades enough. If you're using adult razor blade, you are subjecting yourself to pain, irritation, and potential issues like ingrown hairs. Now, if you use one of those cartridge systems with multiple blades, I totally understand trying to stretch the lifespan of these things because they're not cheap. That's why I always like to recommend shaving with a safety razor. You're going to have a little bit of an upfront investment for the razor itself, but then the blades are just so cheap. You can get a pack of 10 feather blades, which are the ones that I like to use for $10. And if you only change your blade once a week, you can see how much sense that makes to have a close, clean and comfortable shave every time. Grooming mistake number five is shaving against the grain. Now maybe if you have some really tough skin, this isn't a problem for you, but for a lot of us, myself included, our skin is a little more sensitive and shaving against the grain can cause a number of problems including irritation, redness, razor bumps and ingrown hairs, which are the worst. Now shaving against the grain does give you a closer shave and it's why people do it, but I would say that if you are having trouble getting a close shave going with the grain, I would encourage you to try one, a safety razor with a double-edged blade and two, also pay attention to the way your hair grows because I'll bet you that it grows in different directions on different parts of your face and neck. Grooming mistake number six that guys make. Now listen, I'm gonna preface this by saying that anyone who puts time into their appearance is doing the right thing, but you don't wanna be the guy who looks like he puts too much time and effort into that. Talking about the too perfectly edged beard or super chiseled hair, it just doesn't look natural and it comes across like you're trying too hard. mistake number seven that guys make is neglecting to trim their nose and ear hair. You know you're putting all this time and effort into how you dress. You're thinking about all those other grooming things but don't forget your nose hair and your ear hair. And I'm talking especially to us older guys because we know that hair in these areas seems to grow a little quicker and a little more than it used to. So if you subscribe to the mantra that the devil is in the details and that it's the small details that matter most, consider trimming your nose and ear hair to be those small finishing touches that make a huge difference. Grooming mistake number eight that guys make is neglecting their fingernails. I've been told that a guy's fingernails are something that women look at. So you've got to keep them clean, no dirt under there. You want to keep them trimmed, that's easy to do, and pay attention to your cuticles. Now, I'm going to tell you that this is something that I personally need to be a little bit better at, and I'll also tell you that there is nothing wrong with getting a manicure. Don't knock it until you try it. You will see a humongous difference. So there you have it. Those are eight grooming mistakes that guys make.

        "transcript": " So we're just going to jump right in with the outfits here. And first up is a look to let you know that it is fine to wear white pants after Labor Day. Super simple Navy Sportcoat, white pants, and a blue striped shirt, which is the first of five pieces that I'm going to be featuring throughout the video from Lanieri, who is sponsoring today's video. Lanieri is an Italian online made to measure company. They have an incredible selection of fabrics. The ordering process is very simple, thorough, and includes two video consultations. One as you're going through the process and then another once you get the garment to check out the fit and make any necessary adjustments. I've got a link down below for those of you who would like to learn more about the brand and check out what they offer. Up next we have a look for those not afraid of a little bit of pattern. The jacket is from La Niere. It's cut from a silk wool VBC fabric. I styled it with a notch lapel, patch pockets to keep it casual, some contrasting buttons, and since this is meant to be a warm weather sport coat, the jacket is completely unlined. Definitely a bit more of a statement making piece and always remember that the best way to deal with a statement piece is to keep the rest of your outfit simple. You want to have just one focal point. That's why I've chosen just a plain white shirt, navy chinos, simple white pocket square, and some chocolate suede loafers. Now you know that brown is one of my favorite colors and I appreciate meeting up with several of you in New York City about a month ago who wore brown specifically because I love it. Love that. So we've got a textured wool linen blend sport coat paired with some cream colored cotton trousers and a brown striped shirt by Launieri. You can see here that because I knew I wanted this to be a more casual shirt that I chose a button down collar. I really like how the stripe plays with the texture of the jacket and that we're working pretty much here with the whole outfit in brown tones. I did include a white pocket square to add in just a touch of contrast and then anchoring this look some more brown courtesy of the chocolate suede loafers you've been seeing all video long. Although it's definitely still hot out there, we are getting into that seasonal transition period now and with this outfit, I'm really trying to play to both sides of that. For the summer part, that's with my fabric choices. The jacket is a wool silk and linen blend. The shirt by Lanyary is 100% linen and my cream colored trousers are cotton. Leaning into the fall aspect of it are the colors. Really rich and earthy. The jacket, of course, we've got browns and oranges. And then I absolutely love the olive green of the shirt with the great lidded texture. Can be a bit difficult to pair a shirt in a color like this with a sport coat, but the trick is if you keep things in the same type of color story and with colors that complement each other, you will not have any problem at all. I'm gonna keep things going with the interesting, and you might say mildly unorthodox, shirt and jacket combinations here with a look that is mostly monochrome. dark navy cotton trousers paired with a dark navy lanyeri button-up shirt. One thing I want to point out about this shirt's fabric is that it's a cotton jersey fabric so it has a little bit more of a casual and relaxed look and feel to it especially with the contrasting buttons which I think works really well with this look. Again, perhaps not the easiest foundation to pair with a jacket but here I've decided to keep things interesting with a puppy tooth blazer just to a hint of pattern to give the overall looks of texture. Simple white pocket square for some contrast and also to tie in the buttons. And then our chocolate suede loafers to finish things off. One thing I want to mention with regard to Launierie is that the brand is incredibly sustainable. All they're made to measure and made to order garments are manufactured with a zero waste approach. And the fact that the brand is digital means being even more sustainable. If you're interested in trying out Launierie for yourself, got a code for you, HSS100, that will get new customers $100 off orders of $400 or higher. Links are down below in the description."

        "transcript": " For look number one, starting out with the most classic of them all, a black tuxedo. If you're looking for a simple, elegant, and timeless wedding look, look no further than the classic black tux. The jackets, styled with a peaked satin lapel, single button, jetted pockets, and a double vent. Underneath, we've got a self-textured shirt with a turndown collar, stud set, and French cuffs with cufflinks and a matching metal. Remember that your lapel fabric is going to guide your bow tie and cummerbund as well. And here we've got a classic butterfly bow tie and cummerbund, both in satin. For a super traditional tuxedo outfit like this, I like to go with a presidential fold for the pocket square. And then we're doing the classic black patent leather Oxford to finish it off. Super classic and timeless, a black tux is going to be a no brainer. Up next for look number two, a midnight navy blue tuxedo. Blue is a very elegant alternative to black. Not only was it a favorite of many old Hollywood stars as it's supposedly photographed better in black and white than a black tux, but it's also been seen more or less recently on Daniel Craig as James Bond in Skyfall. So it's got both that classic allure and modern sensibility. This particular jacket has a peeped grosgrain lapel and I went with a please shirt which I always feel has a little bit of added elegance that pairs really nicely with the Midnight Blue color, stud set and matching metal cuff links for the French cuffs, grosgrain bow tie and cummerbund to match the grosgrain lapel, going with an elegant puff fold for the pocket square. Notice the grosgrain trim on the breast pocket as well and finishing this look off with a pair of black patent Belgian shoes. This outfit is classic yet modern, a standout alternative to a black tux. For look number three, we're staying with the same Midnight Blue tuxedo, though dressing it up and making it a touch more formal with the addition of the vest. If you're going to opt for a vest instead of a cummerbund for your tux, I always recommend choosing one that's cut lower and with a U-shape like we've got here. It's just got an overall more elegant appearance and gives you an opportunity to show off more of your shirt and stud set. Speaking of the shirt, we've got a Marsella Bibb front shirt with a turned down collar. I think it's got a really rakeish quality to it. that pairs nicely with the Midnight Blue color. Same bow tie, stud set, and cuff links as the last look. Also, keeping the white pocket square with a puff fold, though finishing it off this time with some classic Black Pat and Oxford's. Still classic and timeless though, a little bit of a notch up on the formality scale. Look number four features a double breasted tuxedo. If you're comfortable going double breasted, it is an excellent way to do something special, distinctive, and memorable while still staying within a classic and traditional black tie dress code. This is actually the tuxedo that I wore on my wedding day. It's got a large peaked grosgrain lapel and if you are leaning towards a double breasted tux, definitely make sure that your lapel is on the wider side as it helps balance the proportions of a fuller coverage jacket. This jacket has four buttons and double vent and also has a custom touch of a turnback or cocktail cuff, which for me was a nod to one of my earliest style heroes, James Bond, from that opening scene in Doctor No. For the shirt, we have a pleated front, styled with a stud set and cuff links in a matching metal, a grosgrain modified butterfly bow tie, along with a silk pocket square, done with a puff fold. And once again, a pair of classic black patent oxfords to finish it off. One final note when wearing a double breasted jacket is to always make sure that you button the inside anchor button. It helps the jacket lay flat against your body and helps the garment keep its shape. We're going to switch over from the full tuxedo at this point and move on to some dinner jackets, starting with look number five and a cream or ivory colored dinner jacket. To be completely honest, this is one of my all time favorite pieces of formal wear. It's classy, it's timeless, it's elegant, it's full of relaxed sophistication and it's got some great old school Humphrey Bogart and James Bond vibes. This jacket has a self-facing shawl lapel and jetted pockets along with a double vent, giving it a classic yet contemporary feel. Now, because this is sort of a more relaxed approach to formal wear, we've got a fly front shirt, which also plays into the more modern approach. Remember that with a self-facing lapel, you can kind of go any way you want in terms of your bow tie and cummerbund. Here, I've opted for satin, just because I like the way the sheen of the fabric plays off the jacket. Now, since the jacket is an off-white color, I chose an off-white pocket square instead of white. You still have a little bit of contrast with the jacket, but it's not as pronounced and jarring as it would be with a white pocket square. And then finally, keeping with that more relaxed and sophisticated approach, the patent Belgian shoes to finish it off. For look number six, we have a burgundy dinner jacket. If you want that relaxed dinner jacket feel and are looking for something a little more unique and that stands out without going overboard, This is a really great choice. I also think it's an excellent pick for an evening event as the deep burgundy color really complements that overall vibe. Once again, we have a Shaw lapel. However, this lapel is in a satin fabric. Switching up the shirt this time to a pleated front shirt. It's got that classic yet swanky feel that really matches the effect of the jacket. Of course, stud set and cuff links and a matching metal. Now, one thing I forgot to mention in the last outfit is that if you are wearing a dinner jacket, you will be wearing classic tuxedo pants. For our accessories here, we've got a straight end satin bow tie, satin cummerbund, white silk pocket square with a puff fold and black patent Belgian shoes. Up next for look number seven, we've got something for those of you who are looking for a standout piece in the form of a patterned navy blue dinner jacket. While it's certainly statement making, you can see that the pattern is not super bold and it's actually quite subtle. So from a distance, it's not as loud as it seems to be up close. In addition to the pattern, there's also a contrasting blue satin shawl lapel for a little bit of an added pop. Because this jacket is so modern, we're going with a fly front shirt, which with the absence of a stud set keeps the focus squarely on the jacket. And anytime you're styling a statement piece like this, you always wanna keep the rest of your outfit as simple as possible. Classic butterfly bow tie in a satin fabric creates another contrast with the lapel and pulls in the color of the pants, simple cuff links, white silk pocket square with a puff fold and a patent Belgian shoes to finish it off. Look number eight features a gold velvet dinner jacket which is another great standout choice for an evening event. Velvet jacket always attracts a lot of attention in the best possible way and has a rich and warm feel which is why I think it's particularly nice for nighttime. Like the other dinner jackets we've seen so far, This one also has a shawl lapel and in a satin fabric, which creates a really nice contrast and texture from the velvet. Earlier in the course, I talked about velvet bow ties and here is an instance where I think it is perfectly acceptable to wear one since we've got a velvet jacket, even though the lapel is satin. Since the lapel is satin though, we are going with a satin cummerbund. For the shirt, going with the pleated front, again, playing into the swanky and rake-ish feel of the jacket and because of the color of the jacket, I've decided to go with the off-white pocket square just to tamp down the contrast a bit and not make it as jarring as it would be with a white pocket square. And then finally, playing into the fun of the overall look by finishing it off with some velvet slippers. For our final outfit here, look number nine, we have the most formal of all, which is white tie. This one, kind of throwing in just because since it is an extremely specific dress code and also one that you are exceedingly unlikely to choose for a modern wedding. One very important thing to understand however, is that a white tie dress code does not simply mean wearing a white bow tie with your tuxedo. There are a couple of very particular pieces you need to do white tie correctly, and we're gonna go over those right now. The biggest thing of course is the jacket. Instead of a regular tuxedo jacket, you are going to need a tailcoat. The tailcoat should fit snugly around your torso and is meant to be cut so it cannot be closed or buttoned. Peaked grosgrain lapel is preferred with button facings to match. Underneath, you have a deep cut PK fabric waistcoat that is long enough to cover your waistband, though not so long that it extends beyond the bottom of the jacket. The true white tie waistcoat is also backless, which is a style that was made popular by the Duke of Windsor in the 1920s. The white tie shirt is a wing collar shirt with a Marcella bib front. And another interesting feature of the true white tie shirt is that it should have a loop in the back through which you will thread the waistcoat neckband. Let's talk about accessories. Studs for white tie should be mother of pearl, and that also extends to your cuff links as well. Bow tie will be in the same PK fabric as the waistcoat, with the wings going behind the bow tie. A simple white pocket square, always. A white carnation is a great choice as a boutonniere. And for shoes, you could definitely do patent leather oxfords, but here I chose a classic opera pump as historically, they are the most formal footwear. Once again, white tie, not a common wedding dress code. However, if you're going to do it, this is how to do it right. So there you have it. Those are nine outfit ideas that you can use as inspiration if you are planning a more formal wedding. Nice to see everything kind of come together and get an idea of how these different pieces and different styles of things we've talked about throughout the course, work as a complete outfit. As always, these are just outfit suggestions. There are many, many other approaches. So if you like some of the looks, but wanna change a few things up here and there and are wondering if it will work or if it's appropriate, feel free to let me know."

        "transcript": " So let's play a little game here. First, let's take a look at my watch collection. And you might notice one or two things missing here if you've seen my last watch collection video, but that's not what this video is about. Now, what if I was going to get rid of everything? No Seiko 5, no swatch, Speedmaster, gone, Blue Dreamer, gone, and then goodbye to the Datejust, the tank American, the Reverso, the Vacheron Constantin traditionale, and the heavy, the Lange datagraph. Now if I got rid of all those watches and could only have one watch in my collection, what would it be? Well you'll find out right after this. Now before I reveal what my choice would be for the ultimate one watch collection. I want to thank one of our great partners, Chrono24, for sponsoring this video and supporting the channel, which helps me bring you guys more of the content that you love. So I'm sure that if you're into watches, you probably already know about Chrono24. It's the place that I spent a lot of time scrolling through and daydreaming about all the watches that I would love to have one day. The site itself has 9 million monthly visitors and around half a million watches listed by both trusted dealers and private sellers from all over the world, which makes it pretty much the marketplace throughout the entire world exclusively for luxury watches. If you've never bought a watch online or through an app, it's understandable that you might be a little bit hesitant. But Chrono24 offers a free buyer protection service, which one, ensures that you get what you see online. Two, that you can return the watch to a dealer within 14 days. And three, all of your transactions are fully protected. It's simply the most secure way to shop new pre-owned and vintage watches from tons of brands including Omega, Rolex, Tudor and many, many more. And right now actually, Chrono24 is running a huge giveaway on their YouTube channel where you can enter to win a $10,000 voucher. Yes, you heard it right, $10,000 that you can use towards finally purchasing your DreamWatch. That is an absolutely incredible offer right there, so I wouldn't blame you if you actually pause this video right now and go over to their YouTube channel to enter. I certainly would if I were you. Links to the Chrono24 YouTube channel and more are down below in the description. So a one-watch collection. It's kind of a fun exercise to go through, you know, whether you have a larger collection or or if you don't actually own any watches and are just looking to have one that you would have for the rest of your life. There's so much that goes into the thought process when it comes to this topic. And I think it's really interesting because the watch you choose as your one watch really reveals something about each of us, what we like, what we value and what our design preferences are. I'm gonna walk you through two of the things that I was looking for most as I made my choice, But what I want to encourage you to do is to leave your ultimate one watch collection down below in the comments. But don't just give me the watch. I want to know exactly why you chose it and what specific things you were looking for. So for me, obviously, if you've been a fan of the channel for some time now, you kind of have a pretty good idea of my personal style and preferences when it comes to things. So probably won't shock you at all to know that the two biggest things that I was looking for was a watch that was timeless and a watch that was versatile. I'd want something timeless because if I'm only gonna have one watch in my collection for the rest of my life, I want it to be something transcendent. A watch with a design and pedigree that kind of always looks good and never goes out of style. And I'd want something versatile because, again, if I'm only gonna have that one watch, it better have me covered in pretty much any situation I find myself in anything from day to day casual to more dressed up. Surprisingly, unlike when I bought my first luxury watch, my Rolex Datejust, which took me about nine months to figure out and agonize over, this choice for the one watch collection was pretty much instant. Yeah, I've got several years of watch knowledge and experience under my belt at this point. So I've got a pretty good idea of the landscape. And this wasn't the first time actually that I kind of thought about what this watch would be for me. And I know you're probably thinking right now, well, just stop talking, tell me what this one watch is for crying out loud. So the watch that I would choose that I would consider the ultimate one watch collection for me is this watch right here, the Rolex Explorer reference 114270. The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Explorer is an all-time classic. It's a watch that was designed and developed with adventure in mind, having been inspired by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norge being the first to summit Mount Everest in 1953. A common misconception was that Hillary wore an explorer when he summited Everest, but the watch he actually wore was a Rolex Oyster Perpetual, not an Oyster Perpetual Explorer. Let's dive into some of the specs of this watch though. Both the case and the oyster bracelet are stainless steel. It's got a smooth bezel, a scratch resistant sapphire crystal, and then inside it is powered by a high beat caliber 3130 movement. This is a 36 millimeter case size which is another reason why I absolutely love it. It's great for a smaller wrist like mine as you can see and a 36 millimeter size is great for that more timeless look as well. Moving on to the dial now, which is really remarkable for its balanced simplicity. The dial is black and has luminous hands and hour markers. We have a running seconds hand and then the non luminous Arabic numerals at three, six and nine. From a design and style perspective, this watch is just so simple, super stylish and incredibly versatile. This is easily a watch that no matter who you are, what your job is, and no matter where your style falls on the casual to dressy spectrum, it's a watch that would just fit seamlessly onto anyone's wrist. And the simplicity is another reason why I really love this watch. I like things that are understated and don't necessarily call attention to themselves. And this watch is kind of the epitome of that. It's just so satisfying to look at and wear. Now some of you may be asking why did I choose a six digit explorer for a one watch collection as opposed to something like the 1016 which is highly coveted among collectors and is generally held up as the Rolex Explorer that you'd want to have. So there are actually a couple reasons why I chose the six digit 114270 over the more famous and we would say desirable 1016 model. First is the price. The 114-270 is in the $7-8000 range. Not a drop in the bucket by any means, but if you consider the fact that 1016s are trading around $20,000 and much, much higher than that, $7-8000 is a price tag that is somewhat easier to stomach. The second reason I chose the 6-digit Explorer over the 1016 is that personally, I'm not a huge vintage watch guy. I like them and I can appreciate them for sure, but having owned a vintage GMT master previously, I mean, I like the watch a lot, but there's just something about the vintage thing that didn't really get me as excited as I thought it would. Doesn't mean I wouldn't consider a cool vintage watch in the future, but just kind of knowing that about myself now, I definitely would think twice about going that route personally again. So that is the watch, the Rolex Explorer, reference 114.270 that I would choose as my ultimate one watch collection. Definitely interested in hearing your picks and the reasons behind them. So please leave those down in the comments and be sure to check out the links in the description below to check out Rolex explorers, as well as many more watches on chrono 24. And if you decide to buy with chrono 24, don't forget to do the checkout with their free escrow service. So you are protecting your purchase."

        "transcript": " It's no secret that I like nice things and I have no problem paying a little extra to invest in quality and craftsmanship. But not everything I have and use regularly is expensive. In fact, some of the things I use on a daily basis don't actually cost that much. And in this video, I'm going to share with you eight inexpensive things I cannot live without. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. This video is sponsored by Blinkist, which is an app I've been a fan of and have been using for over a year now. If you've never heard of it, what Blinkist does is summarize and round up all of the best parts of over 3,000 nonfiction books that you can either read or listen to in just 15 minutes. If you're someone who wants to read but feels like you just don't have the time, Blinkist is a great way to add that to your life without having to set aside a ton of time specifically devoted to reading. You could listen while you're getting ready in the morning, while you're in the car going to work or even running errands. And in just that short amount of time, you're getting the most important concepts from those books. I definitely fall into the category of the person who wants to read but doesn't necessarily have the time. I keep myself ridiculously busy and because of that, one of the books that I like to go back to as much as I can is a book called Essentialism, which gives you tools to be more productive by doing less. Sounds good to me. And if you're someone who always feels super busy but also feels like you never really get anything done despite that. Essentialism is a book that I would definitely recommend for you. Another book on my list is Sapiens, which a while ago my friend Eustace recommended to me. It sounds really cool, but I'm not sure if I really want to invest myself in it just yet. So I'm looking forward to getting the distilled version via Blinkist and then deciding if I want to take the plunge into the whole book. If you're interested in signing up for Blinkist, the first 100 people to go to that link that I have down below in the description, we'll get unlimited access for one week to try it out. The trial is completely free and you can cancel at any time. And then after the trial, if you do go for the full membership, you'll also get 25% off. They do also now have full length audiobook features as well and premium subscribers get special member pricing, which is up to 65% off the regular price. Up first we have this OLED mini flashlight and when I say mini, I mean mini. This thing is half an inch wide and two and a quarter inches long. It fits right in the palm of your hand. You can put it on a key chain if you want. The model of this one is the i3E EOS. It's powered by a single AAA battery and puts out a max of 90 lumens which is plenty bright, lights up a room in the dark. I own a handful of flashlights but I love this one because of the size. It's very easy to carry around and the price at $9.95 you really can't beat. This item here is a 4 inch shoe horn. This is made for us by Abbey Horn and is available in the shop. We have a few different sizes of shoe horns in the shop, but the 4 inch one is the one that I use pretty much on a daily basis. The material is natural horn and because of that, as well as the fact that it's handmade, the cool thing is that every one of these shoe horns is one of a kind and will have different marbling on it. I always take this with me in a briefcase or a backpack, whether I'm traveling or just happen to be out for the day. And at $20, it's a great price for a very useful, unique and handmade item. Item number three is the Parker Jotter Pen. If you remember my last EDC video, you've seen this before, and although I have several other pens, including a couple by Mont Blanc, I love the Parker Jotter just because of the way it feels in the hand. I like the way it writes. And then there also is the fact that the Parker Jotter is the pen that Q gives James Bond in GoldenEye. that is actually tricked out as a class four grenade. So of course, love the bond connection, love the pen, which you can find on Amazon for 10.99. Up next is a travel garment steamer. Now, I used to have a full-size steamer and it's actually sitting right over there in the corner behind the door. It's been there for a while because it's broken and I haven't gotten rid of it yet. But the travel steamer works just as well, not to mention it's a travel steamer, so it's easy to pack and take with you. I use it all the time and for $25, I think it's a pretty sound investment. Okay, so those of you who know me know that I really love niche fragrances. However, you also know that I am not opposed to wearing budget or drugstore fragrances and I actually did a whole video devoted to cheap fragrances that you can watch with the link right up there. One fragrance that I didn't include in that video, which is inexpensive item number five that I can't live without, is this one right here, Aqua De Selva. Now, the way I actually got curious about this fragrance was by seeing it in the Pink Panther movie. There's a scene early on where David Niven opens up the medicine cabinet and pulls out a big bottle of Aqua De Selva. And, you know, who doesn't wanna be as suave as David Niven? So I had to buy it and I absolutely love it, I have to tell you. It's a classic Oda Cologne with a little bit of a piney bite to it. I've been wearing this almost daily for the past few months. I put it on after a shower. It's very inexpensive. 100 milliliters costs 1386. And the big bottle that I have 200 milliliters costs 2561 on Amazon for item number six. It's another grooming related product. And that is my Merkur double edge safety razor. I love to shave with a safety razor. This one is the smaller version. The handle's not quite as long, which I like. Feels really nice in the hand. It's got a good heft to it. It's not cheap, but I would consider it inexpensive at $40. And the fact that I have had this particular razor for over a decade definitely makes it worth the money. And if anyone's wondering, my preferred blades are feather blades. The seventh inexpensive thing that I can't live without are these small field notes notebooks. Pack of three of these costs $12.95. As I said before, I'm not a fan of taking notes on my phone. First of all, I hate typing with my thumbs. And second, when I write a note on my phone, I never think about it again, and it just kind of disappears. I prefer to write things down by hand. For me, it's just so much easier. I'm visual, so when I actually write it and see it, I can remember it better. And it's very easy to flip through all the old pages to remember all those great ideas that I had. Finally, item number eight is this clothing brush by Kent. It's $36, incredibly well-made and durable. I use this at home. It's easy to slip into a briefcase. It's easy to travel with. And I prefer using this over an adhesive lint roller whenever possible.

        "transcript": " Why is it that when you're younger, you always want to look older and then when you're older, you always want to look younger? It's one of life's interesting paradoxes. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think there's anything wrong with aging, but there's a big difference between aging gracefully versus looking like you've aged. You know what I mean? Like you want to go to your 20-year high school reunion and have people tell you, wow, you look great, man, rather than whispering behind your back. Geez, I can't believe how old that guy looks. So in this video, I'm gonna be revealing six simple things you can do to keep yourself looking younger, longer. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Okay, so this first one is literally the easiest thing in the world to do, and it's something that I have done every single time I go to the barber. I don't know why this works, but it does. And the thing I am talking about is to trim your eyebrows. As we get older, as some of us already know, hair starts to do weird things, especially when it comes to the facial area. Like, all of a sudden you're getting hair on your ears, coming out of your ears, your nose, and of course, those eyebrows, which can start to get really shaggy. If you're not maintaining them, in addition to your ears and nose, it just makes you look older and like you've kind of given up in some way and this is not what we want to project out into the world. So next time you're at the barber, tell him or her to give your eyebrows a quick trim, put the comb on there, go over them with the clippers and then you will look younger, more youthful and like someone who puts time and effort into maintaining themselves. Nothing wrong with that. The next way to keep yourself looking younger longer is to take care of your skin. Now, what you need to know about skin care is that the sooner you can make it part of your daily routine, the better the results will be over time. So if you haven't been taking care of your skin, you need to start immediately. Now, I hear you and I know that one of the problems that guys have when it comes to skin care is that it seems too complicated and that you just don't know where to start. And that is why I am pleased to have Teach Handling as today's video sponsor. Guys, T-Shandley takes the guessing out of skincare and makes it completely uncomplicated and super simple. When you get the box in the mail, the first thing you see when you open it up is a card telling you exactly what you need to do. It seriously does not get any easier than that. And it's one of the things that I personally love most about their system. T-Shandley gives you everything you need even with their basic plan, which includes a facial cleanser, exfoliating scrub, AM and PM moisturizers.

If you want to step up your game even more, you can level up to the level three system, which is what I use every single day, and that adds in a firming serum and eye cream.

So click that link to get started for just $25. So about three, four weeks ago, I really thought that something was wrong with me. I had a weird sensation on the left side of my Adam's apple. I had pretty much constant pain right here on my shoulder and that base of my skull right back here. And maybe the worst and most concerning part was that I had a throbbing headache right here all day long for about a week or two that would get worse as the day went on. And by the evening, it was really bad. I'd never really felt anything like that before, so my mind went to a pretty bad place. I thought there really, really was something wrong with me. So I got the first appointment with my doctor as I could. And what she told me was, number one, this muscle is really, really tight. And number two, that I was under an immense amount of stress and thinking that something was wrong with me did not help that at all. This is one of the things that I wrestle with all the time. I always have to be doing something. There's always another project I want to start on top of everything else that I do. I just like to keep piling it on and piling it on and keeping myself busy. But that leads to a lot of stress, and stress will make you age faster. And I'm not just talking about gray hairs here. I'm talking about two very important things here for your health, as well as how you look. Stress is a terrible thing for your body and your mind. I learned that firsthand very recently. It's making hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, surge throughout your body, resulting in higher blood pressure. I've never had high blood pressure in my entire life. It's always right where it should be, but that day, when I took my blood pressure at the doctor, I was pushing like 140 over 75. High blood pressure is not only unhealthy, but it makes the body age faster, so you've got to find ways to reduce the stress in your life. For me, that's doing a little bit less and exercising. Exercise is such a great way to release energy, to release that stress from your body, but what you need to do is to find those things that bring you a sense of calm and to make time for them. Carve out that time in the day for yourself to help yourself. You'll be healthier and you won't age quite as fast. Speaking of aging quickly, let's talk about something that really accelerates the aging process in terms of how you look, and that is smoking. In addition to being bad for your heart, lungs and bones, smoking chronically changes your skin, teeth, and hair in ways that will add years to how you look. Now, what are some things that happen? Smoking deprives your skin of oxygen and nutrients, which accelerates the aging process. Not good. Many of the over 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke trigger the destruction of collagen and elastin, which causes sagging skin and wrinkles. There's research that suggests that smokers are more susceptible to age spots after spending time in the sun. It's gonna damage your teeth and your gums. Smoking can accelerate your hair thinning. I am not judging you if you are a smoker. I know that it is a habit, and that it is a habit that can be incredibly tough to quit. All I wanna point out is that smoking accelerates the aging process. So if you wanna look younger, longer, consider quitting smoking. But don't just do it to look younger because it's good for your health too. All right, I've got two more tips for you. One is kind of a quick fix and the other is more of a long-term process that pays big dividends. Gonna start off with a quick fix though and back to what I mentioned at the beginning of the video of when you're younger, how you wanna look older. One of the things guys can't wait to do when they're younger is grow a mustache and a beard. When you were in high school, Being able to grow a mustache or beard made you look older and more mature, which is what you want when you're a 16 year old kid, right? While the same holds true when you're older because that beard makes you look older. Look at this photo of me with a beard and look at me right now. You see the difference, right? I look younger without the beard. So quick fix for looking younger longer, shave that beard. Okay, let's talk about the more process oriented long-term thing now, which is to make sure that you get enough sleep. You've heard people say, I need my beauty rest, right? And it's not just a saying, there's actually something to that. So you know that sleep is the time when your body is resting and repairing itself. This is actual science and both deep and REM sleep have been linked to cell and tissue repair. So getting enough sleep helps give your skin that extra boost. While you are sleeping, your body's making collagen. Collagen is the stuff that literally holds your body and skin together. So the more sleep you get, the more time you're giving your body to make collagen, which for our purposes here of looking younger longer, helps fight the appearance of wrinkles. So there you have it. Those are my six easy ways to look younger longer.

        "transcript": " I hear you when it's hot out, the last thing you might be thinking about is putting on a jacket. But if you're choosing one in the right fabric, you will stay cool and look great. And in this video, I'm going to be sharing five of my favorite summer sport coats. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. So here we go, outfit number one and we are starting off with a light gray fresco. Fresco is a high twist wool fabric making it very light, airy and breathable, which is perfect because fresco in Italian means fresh. I've styled it here with a sporty navy gingham button-up shirt along with some navy cotton trousers with a two inch cuff on the bottom, simple white pocket square, Bacheron Constantin traditionelle on the wrist, and finished off with some brown derby shoes. This is an outfit that is perfect for a summer date night alfresco dinner. See what I did there. Now all of these sport coats are favorites of mine, but this particular one in a brown wool linen is really one of my favorites. The fabric is by Reda. The weight is 260 grams. It's 57% linen and 43% wool. So you've got the breathability as well as the versatility. I love the weave of it, which gives it kind of a textural appearance and makes it a nice option for someone looking to graduate from straight up solids, but not necessarily interested in a bold pattern. Simple styling here, just a crisp white linen shirt, paired with some cream cotton chinos, white pocket square, JLC Reverso on the wrist, and anchored by a pair of chocolate suede loafers by Bowdoin and Lang. Up next we have the eternally classic navy blazer. There are many blazers like this, but this one is mine. And I've chosen to go with a notch lapel, flat pockets, and brass buttons to really lean into that super classic navy blazer thing. You know, it's one of the most versatile pieces you can have in your wardrobe and I tried to show that off a little bit here with a very sporty summer styling. Some nautical vibes with the t-shirt, paired with the same cream colored chinos from the last look. of a Devil May Care pocket square fold here, Oliver Peoples Bank sunglasses, Cartier Tank American on the wrist, and then finally finished off with some common projects, white sneakers. For our fourth look, another classic, the khaki cotton blazer, styled very simply here with a white linen shirt and navy cotton pants. One thing that's often pointed to as a downfall of a cotton blazer is the fact that the fabric doesn't drape the way, let's say, a nice wool does. Definitely can be the case but this particular fabric from Huddersfield is very soft, supple and buttery so it does provide a little more give and movement. This outfit is really kind of like a too easy business casual outfit which is completed here with a white pocket square, leather belt, Vacheron Constantin on the wrist, and leather derby shoes by Enzo Bonafé. Here we We have a jacket that kind of screams style more than speaking it, and I mean that in the best possible way. This particular sport coat is cut from an exquisite Laurel Piana wool, silk and linen blend and features a bold windowpane plaid. Despite the bold pattern, it is still incredibly versatile due to the light brown base color, which is super easy to pair with such a wide variety of items. I kept it kind of summery and sporty here with a denim shirt and white cotton pants. No pocket square, completely by design. JLC Reverso on my wrist and finished off with a pair of chocolate suede, Bowden and Lang loafers. All of the sport coats featured in this video as well as many of the other items are now available in the HSS shop with the links down below in the description. We definitely like to encourage people to go the custom route for the best fit, but we do offer off the rack sizing as well. That's something you prefer. All the styling details are also fully customizable, so if there's something you want to change, such as pockets, lapels, buttons, anything really, you can pretty much do whatever you want. So click the link and check out what we have available in the HSS shop for some great summer style."

        "transcript": " When you've invested in quality suits, shoes, and knitwear, the number one thing you are probably most concerned with is how to preserve and protect those things so they last as long as possible. If you spent that money, you want this stuff to last. So in this video, I'm going to be sharing five must have wardrobe maintenance tools to help you do just that. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Want to give a big shout out and thank you to Duluth Trading Company and their best made brand for sponsoring this video. Duluth Trading Company is a premium American lifestyle brand and retailer of high quality apparel and adventure gear. They've evolved quite a bit and have added a number of other great brands to their collection, including Bestmade, all that share their values of quality, craftsmanship, impeccable design, and making products that last. You know that these are all things that I care about and value as well with the purchases that I make. Nothing wrong with having high standards. And I wanna show you five items that I've picked up from them recently that are super nice pieces for your own personal collection or that make great gift ideas. First up is this short sleeve camp shirt which has honestly become something of a summer uniform for me. It's a cotton linen blend, so super light and airy. I like the flow of it, which makes it very comfortable. It's got a single pocket and a camp collar, keeping it casual. And they say to order one size up, which I did and definitely recommend. Up next is a classic Heather Gray cotton crew neck athletic sweatshirt. Definitely a great casual staple to have in your wardrobe. It's got a brushed back fleece interior for softness, a raglan sleeve construction for increased freedom of movement and an extra long rib at the cuffs so it can be worn cuffed or uncuffed. Here we have a La Yola corkscrew and bottle opener combination. Stainless steel with a matte finish. The handle is made with olive wood. It's got a folding corkscrew, bottle opener and serrated blade, which makes it super easy to get the foil off a bottle of wine. And this is actually one of my favorite items to give as a housewarming gift. Next is a set of stainless steel cups along with a cowhide leather carrier so that you're always prepared when traveling or out on an adventure. And then finally, you know that I kind of have a thing for flashlights and we've got this super nice brass flashlight here. Great size, fits right in the hand, feels substantial and looks great to boot. Links to all these products as well as to Deluth Trading Company are down below in the description. Wardrobe maintenance tool number one is a fabric brush. This is something you use to keep your suits and sport coats free of dirt and dust. Now, you may be asking, what about a lint roller? And as someone with a long hair German Shepherd dog, I totally feel you on this. A lint roller is a good effective short-term solution, but it's not the best option for your nicest suits and sport coats. What makes a lint roller work and so effective is the sticky adhesive. But each time you use it, you can actually leave a small amount of that adhesive residue on the fabric, which can have the effect of attracting more dust over time. So that's why for long-term care and preservation, a fabric brush is going to be a better option. When you use a fabric brush, the bristles of the brush actually get deep into the fibers, getting rid of any embedded dirt or dust. In terms of when to use a fabric brush, I recommend a quick once over in the morning before putting your clothing on, just to get rid of any dust that's settled on it. And then again at the end of the day, before hanging your suit or spurt coat up to get anything out of it that may have collected throughout the day. Personally, I like to start at the top with the shoulders and then move down to the lapels. Next, I'll do the sleeves and then finally the body of the jacket. Up next, wardrobe maintenance tool number two are shoe trees. Now, I'm gonna be the first to admit here that early on in my style journey, taking care of my shoes was not top of mind. When I did my shoe collection video, So many people were all over me for the fact that I had obviously not properly cared for many of my shoes, and particularly that I had not used shoe trees. So I'm hoping that by including this, that you will not make the same mistake that I did early on. So shoe trees are devices that are shaped like your foot, that are meant to be placed inside your shoes when you're not wearing them. And they serve two very important purposes. Number one is to help your shoes keep their shape and avoid creasing in the leather. And number two is to absorb moisture, which helps fight and prevent odors. Now, when we're talking about moisture in a leather shoe, not only does that contribute to odors, but it can also have a negative impact on the shape of the shoe. And the telltale sign of this is where you see the toe box of the shoe actually start to curve upwards. But by using shoe trees to help keep the shape of the shoe, this is very easy to counteract. Shoe trees come in a variety of materials, with the most common being plastic and wood. Plastic, while cheaper and lighter, doesn't help fight odors or absorb any moisture. So they're really only doing half the job, which is why I recommend using cedar shoe trees. Now you'll sometimes see wooden shoe trees with a nice glossy finish, which might look nice, but when you have a finished wood like this, it will not have the same moisture absorption of an unfinished wood. So always best to stick with wooden shoe trees that are unfinished. In an ideal world, you'd have shoe trees for all your shoes, but if that's not possible, can be kind of expensive. Invest in at least one nice set and use them in the shoes that you've just worn. Keep them in for at least 24 hours, and then use them in whatever pair of shoes you wear next. WordDrop Maintenance Tool number three is a sweater shaver. Now, there's nothing better than when you first get a new sweater, especially if it's cashmere, and it looks perfect and brand new. But you know that as you wear it over time, it will start to pill up. It can be tempting to try and pull these off with your fingers, especially if there are just a few, but this is a bad idea. If you do that, you're going to actually loosen and degrade the fabric further, which will result in the garment not lasting as long. That's why I like to use a sweater shaver, which just gently glides over the fabric and removes all the fuzz and pills without pulling on the fabric and leaves your sweaters looking, honestly, almost brand new. And if you've ever used one of these, there's just something like so satisfying about the process of doing this. So you have that as well as the main point of it, which is to keep your sweaters looking good and like the very first time you wore them. Wordrobe maintenance tool number four is a garment steamer. Now, you may be wondering, well, isn't it okay to just use an iron? And in some instances, then iron is actually preferred over a steamer, especially for shirts and trousers where you wanna have that really sharp crease. However, when it comes to jackets, a steamer is the way to go. It is the simplest and safest way to remove wrinkles from jackets in pretty much any fabric. In addition to that, as you know, you wanna try and minimize as much as possible the amount of times that you are laundering your suits or sport coats or bringing them to the dry cleaner. Dry cleaning is actually really terrible for fabric. Sometimes there's no other option if you have a really bad stain, for example. And using a steamer is a great way to freshen up your garments between trips to the dry cleaner. There are different types of garment steamers out there, and most of them are generally very affordable. You'll see ones that sit on the ground that have a hanger attached to them, which is really nice and super easy to use. And then there are small handheld travel versions, which are a really great option as they don't take up much space and are very affordable. Wardrobe maintenance tool number five, wooden hangers. Particularly when we are talking about suit jackets and sport coats, you need to have the proper hanger so the garment keeps its shape and doesn't get misshapen. Wooden hangers are more durable than wire or plastic hangers and for your suit jackets and sport coats, you wanna look for a hanger that has a wide arm down to the shoulder and that has a little bit of contour. This is going to help maintain that shoulder shape over time, it's gonna keep the collar from being misshapen, and by holding it in the proper position, it's going to ensure that it never stretches out. So there you have it, those are my five must have wardrobe maintenance tools. If you've invested in your wardrobe, these are the things you absolutely need to keep your wardrobe looking great longer. Thanks again to Duluth Trading Company and their best made brand for sponsoring this video.

        "transcript": " What do you get when you combine heritage, new technology, and retro appeal? You get something like that. Those are three watches from Accutron's new legacy collection, who we are proud to partner with for today's video to introduce you to the brand and take a closer look at these three timepieces. Now, the coolest and most interesting watches aren't just timepieces, they're conversation pieces. And actually, if you're a Mad Men fan, you may remember that line from a famous pitch made by the character Freddie Rumson for acutron watches. So back in the 1950s, some watch companies started thinking about how they could address some of the fail points of mechanical watches and particularly mechanical movements, which of course are very intricate and as a result, prone to having many things go wrong that could affect the accuracy of the watch or the watch just running in general. So that's when we saw the birth of the battery-powered watch with the first example being the Hamilton 500 introduced in 1957. Accutron, however, took a very different approach. Instead of using a balance wheel, which all mechanical watches use, they used a tuning fork driven by an electromagnetic coil system powered by a battery. This was advantageous because a tuning fork is more resistant to shocks, which results in greater accuracy. It also did two other really interesting things. First, instead of the classic tick of the watch, it hummed because of the vibrations of the tuning fork. And then the second hand, instead of moving in jumps from second to second, had a smoother gliding motion. Accutron watches were also known for their design, particularly the space view, which made quite a splash with its deconstructed outer case design, open work dial, and exposed tuning fork movement. But beyond the space view, All the acutron watches had a really unique look that was both modern and elegant. The three watches we're gonna be taking a closer look at today are from Acutron's new Legacy Collection, which revived some of the brand's most memorable designs from the 1960s and 70s, each a cultural and iconic design touchstone. Up first, we have the 521. Acutron introduced this watch in 1960, and it is one of the best examples of the asymmetrical look that became a hallmark of Accutron's design language. This is sometimes referred to as the king of rock and roll watch as it was a favorite of a certain rock and roll king who was often photographed wearing it. The asymmetrical case was something completely different and new at the time and even today, it still looks very fresh and modern. The case and the size of the case of the new 521 is completely true to the original at 32.8 by 32.5 millimeters, which makes it wearable for both men and women. The case itself is stainless steel with a gold tone. We've got a silver dial sweeping seconds hand with a tuning fork detail. And then I love how the hour indices kind of have that lightning bolt look to them. The asymmetry continues to the crown placement as well just below three o'clock. The case back is partially see-through. And then the example I have here is on a brown lizard embossed leather strap with a double press de-plant buckle closure. This model is also available on a gold-toned stainless steel bracelet. Super cool standout piece that looks just as modern today as it did back in 1960. Up next we have the 505 which is a very classic and elegant dress watch though originally a favorite surprisingly of physicians and nurses. This watch was originally released in the 1960s and the case shape was called the alpha case. Alpha alluding to being the first of its kind and socially dominant, which appealed to medical workers. Accutron is actually short for accuracy through electronics, and it became popular in the medical field because of that sentiment as well as its accuracy. The most notable feature of the dial here are the crosshairs, dividing the dial into 15 second quarters, providing the foundation to check blood pressure and pulse. Because of that, a lot of surgeons used it, a lot of nurses used it, and it really became a tool watch in hospitals across the country. Of course, we've got that great subtly asymmetric case design, elegant hour markers with arrows at three, six, nine, and the tuning fork at 12, asymmetrical crown placement again this time at four o'clock, simple hour and minute hands with the sweep seconds hand, partially see through case back, and here shown on a black lizard embossed leather strap with a double press deployant buckle. I love the understated elegance of the 505 and at 33mm it's perfect for those of us with smaller wrists who are looking for a simple but unique dress watch. The third watch we're going to be taking a look at here is the RR-Zero. This is known as the Railroad Watch as it features a design that was very similar to that of a past approved 1970 Canadian Railroad Watch. The look of the 34mm case of the RR-Zero is very different than many of Accutron's other offerings in that it is largely symmetrical, save for the placement of the crown, which, like the 505, is at 4 o'clock. As this was originally intended to be a tool watch, the dial is extremely legible and useful. We have 12 hour time in Arabic numerals around the outside of the dial, 24 hour time nestled within that. And then at 3 o'clock, we have a small date window, leaf shaped hour and minute hands, and then a red sweeping second hand which stands out for increased legibility. Like all the watches in Acutron's Legacy Collection, there is a partially see-through case back. And this watch comes on a black leather strap with double press deploy out buckle. The RR0 is a simple and unassuming tool watch with a wonderful history. So there you have it, three really cool watches from Acutron's new Legacy Collection. Let me know your thoughts on these watches and be sure to check them all out on the Acutron website with the link down below in the description."

        "transcript": " Do you know what I would absolutely love? I would love to always be this version of myself. But you know what? That takes a lot of work, a lot of discipline, and a lot of sacrifice. And I'd be lying if I said, that's what I look like right now because it's not. I've got a little bit of extra belly fat, just a little. And you know how hard that can be to get rid of. But I know how to do it because I've done it before. exhibit A right there. And in this video, I'm going to share my five secrets to losing stubborn belly fat. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where you get the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. So now that that's out of the way, let's start off with secret number one and that is to stop drinking alcohol. We all know that there are a lot of calories in alcoholic drinks. A regular beer is about 150 calories. A craft beer with a higher alcohol content could be north of 300 calories. A glass of wine is around 125 calories. A shot of whiskey, about 100. And mixed drinks kind of in the 200 calorie range. So a lot of extra calories you're putting in your body, but beyond those calories, it's what your body does to the alcohol that contributes to you gaining fat. What happens is the alcohol is stored in your body as a triglyceride, which is a fancy name for fat. So the more you drink, the more you store. Plus alcohol kind of makes you feel bloated. For me, beer is the worst culprit. So that's why I rarely drink beer. So if you cut it out, you also lose that overall bloated feeling and appearance. So when I'm trying to shed that extra layer of fat that is so hard to get rid of, cutting out alcohol completely is the first step that I take. Secret number two to losing stubborn belly fat is to drink more water. So I know this sounds strange, but your body water percentage has a direct correlation to your body fat percentage. So by increasing the amount of water in your body, you're more or less increasing your lean tissue amount and therefore decreasing your body fat percentage. Like I said, I know it sounds weird, but it's true. Back when I raced a bicycle, I stepped on a scale two times a day. Once in the morning, right when I woke up, and then again before going to bed. The scale that I had measured weight, body fat, and body water. When I was not as well hydrated as I should have been, my body water percentage was lower and my body fat percentage was higher. And then if I was well hydrated, the numbers flip flopped. I'm not exactly sure how that works, but I know it to be true. And I know that I look and feel leaner when I'm well hydrated. So when it comes to how much water you should drink in a day, most experts say 8 8 ounce glasses. So 64 ounces of water a day. But you have to spread that out throughout the day. You can't not drink anything all day long and then try to make up that 64 ounces right before going to bed. I always start out every morning with a big glass of water and then just kind of sip throughout the day. One of the interesting tips I learned from my coach when I was a cyclist was that he said, if you're thirsty, it's too late. You're already dehydrated. So be sure to drink throughout the day and not just when you have thirst. So for a lot of us, myself included, working to lose fat is something that we do not only to improve our health, but also to improve our appearance and our confidence. And though not related to losing stubborn belly fat, having a good skin care routine is one of those things that is so easy to implement and a great way to also boost your appearance and confidence. We have partnered once again with Tee's Hanley who's sponsoring today's video and I have to tell you that regardless of whether they were sponsoring this video or not, that I absolutely love this stuff. It's so simple, it works and I have definitely noticed a change in my skin since I started using it religiously about eight or nine months ago. And hey, when you look your best, you feel your best too, and TeachHandley has been helping me do both of those things. Personally, I use the Level 3 system, which is their most advanced system. It includes a facial cleanser, a face scrub, a morning moisturizer with SPF 20, an evening moisturizer, an eye cream, and a serum, which is formulated with proven ingredients to slow down the appearance of aging. When you join TeachHandley, you're gonna get access to a bunch of perks as well, including free US shipping, 25% off the retail price, exclusive access to new products like their new body wash, and more.

Just click the first link in the description to get the best possible price and a free gift with your first box. You can You can get started for just $25, which you know is a great price if you've ever done any sort of research into quality skincare products. Okay, secret number three is to not eat crap. No fried foods, no fast food, no chips, no candy, no soda, not a lot of sugar, no ice cream, not a lot of carbs. I told you there were sacrifices that you would have to make. So this tip is so easy yet it's so hard because you have to exercise that willpower. power, right? But one of the things that happens is that when you start eating well, your body completely forgets about all that crappy food. And then when you go to eat it, it just kind of feels like you're poisoning yourself. The only other thing I want to say about eating is that I've never tried any of these fad diets before. Keto, Paleo, Atkins, South Beach, never done it. I've always believed that you have to have a well rounded diet of protein, fat and carbohydrates, the last of which, unless you are an elite endurance athlete, you really don't need a lot of. Your body needs all those things and think of your plate in thirds and make sure that you don't overdo any one of them. Secret number four is to exercise. I know, kind of a no-brainer, but in order to lose weight or fat, you have to expend more calories than you take in. There has to be that deficit there. And when it comes to the type of exercise that you do, it should be a combination of things. You need to have a cardio element, and you need to have some type of resistance training or weight training. Having and getting into an exercise routine is very similar to eating properly in that once you start doing it, your body really starts to feed off it and honestly crave it. So if you miss a day or a few days, your body's kind of like, what's going on? You know, I need to move. I need this to feel good. In terms of particulars, a little outside of the time in scope we have here with this video, but if you have suggestions for an exercise routine that's work for you or want to know what my exercise routine is, let me know down in the comments. The final secret to losing stubborn belly fat, secret number five, is to get plenty of sleep. Sleeping is something we do every day, so super easy, but you've got to make sure you're getting the right amount of sleep. Sleep is an important part of this equation because when you're sleeping, your body is repairing itself, specifically by releasing growth hormones. What those hormones do is to stimulate muscle and protein synthesis as well as a process called this that breaks down fat and that I can't pronounce. Growth hormones peak at night, so if you're not sleeping enough, you're basically cutting that process short. In terms of how much to sleep each night to maximize this, experts say that between seven to nine hours is optimal. One thing I wanna let you know is that getting into new habits like this can be very difficult to do, especially if it's going to be a big change for you. So to help you get motivated, I put together a playlist which is right over there that includes lots of specific ways to get yourself on the right track.

So back in February, we started to work on putting together a complete online course called the Groom Guide, specifically focused on helping grooms look and feel their best on their wedding day. The entire course will be 25 plus videos and is going to be launching one month from today on July 14th. I'll definitely be filling you in about that launch when we get there. But what I want to do today is to tell you about a really special initiative we have going on right now leading up to launch date. Now over the past 15 months, I know that so many couples have had to pivot their wedding planning due to the global pandemic. And now as we seem to be emerging from that and getting back to more in-person weddings, I wanted to find a way to do something that could really make a difference for someone. So that is why we are rolling out the Groom Guide Gives Back campaign where we are going to help one deserving groom create a custom look for their big day. If you're planning to get married, you can nominate yourself, or if there's someone you know who's getting married and is deserving of this, like a frontline worker, or someone who stepped up in a big way, you can go ahead and nominate them. We've all faced challenges over the last 15 months and I really wanna hear your stories. There is a link down below in the description that will take you to the submission form where you can share that story, let us know why you or your loved one is deserving of this experience and why this opportunity would mean so much to you and your family. We will be announcing the winner on launch day, July 14th, so stay tuned. More information about the Groom Guide is down below as well. I'm really looking forward to celebrating and honoring those who are most deserving. So please join me to help make this happen for someone."

        "transcript": " Who doesn't want to improve themselves or accomplish more or be more successful, right? I mean, something that we all want to do. But when you're thinking about life changing stuff, it can feel like it's going to take a lot of effort. That's not necessarily true though. And in this video, I'm going to reveal 10 extremely simple life changing habits that you can start today. I'm Brian Sakawa and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. Life changing habit number one is to set daily goals. Nothing feels better than accomplishing something right and there's no reason you can't accomplish things every single day. But the trick is here that you need to set practical goals. So like launching a new business that's a great goal to have but that's not something that you can do in a single day. So if you don't do that in a single day, don't feel like you haven't accomplished anything. I've had a lot of success where at the very beginning of the day, I sit down at my desk and I take out my notepad, super old school, and I spend about five minutes thinking about what I need to accomplish and then I write those things down. Those are the things I'm going to focus on that day, not on anything else. And when I finish a specific task, I cross it off and that's one goal for the day achieved. And then at the end of the day, maybe I haven't gotten to everything on the list, but that's That's okay because I see all the things that I have crossed off those goals that I've achieved for the day and I count those as wins. Life changing habit number two is to unfollow social media accounts that do not bring you joy. So probably about four or five years ago, I found myself kind of having an unhealthy relationship with social media and Instagram specifically. I was spending way too much time looking at other people, what they were doing, comparing myself to them. It was distracting. It took me away from what I needed to be doing. Just way too much time spent in a black hole not accomplishing anything and just a terrible use of my time. So I was like, okay, I don't like these people. I have no real reason to follow them. The only thing I'm getting out of this is nothing actually. So I went through and unfollowed all those people and I just felt so much better after that. So seriously, If you find yourself doing what I just described and losing hours of your life to this worthless thing, scrub the people you follow and then unfollow all the ones that do not have a positive impact on you. Life changing habit number three is to say no to things. To me, it always feels like everyone is asking me for everything and you know, I'm happy to help anyone with whatever they need help with, but at a certain point, it just seems like it's coming at me from all directions and emails are piling up and I'm forgetting things because of this and I just can't get everything or actually I can't get anything done. It's frustrating. I feel paralyzed. I just want to like crawl up in a little ball and for everyone to leave me alone. So what I've realized is that there comes a point where you just have to start saying no to things. I'd love to help everyone out but I just don't have the time and that's fine. I say no because I can't. I'm not being a jerk. I'm just being realistic. And I'm avoiding a situation where I'm setting up some false expectations for someone. There's a great book called Essentialism, The Discipline Pursuit of Less, which I highly recommend checking out if you find yourself having a hard time saying no to things. It will teach you how to pick out the most important things and eliminate everything else so you can focus your energy on those things that really matter. Life changing habit number four is to commit to looking your best. Lots of ways you can do this, clothing for example, but in this particular instance, I wanna highlight taking care of your face. Having a good skincare routine is a great daily habit to get into because not only does it improve your appearance in the short term, but it also pays a lot of dividends as you age, which is something that matters to me as a 43 year old guy. For the past six months or so, I've been exclusively using products by our sponsor for today's video, Teesh Handley, and specifically the level three advanced system, which includes a facial cleanser, a face scrub, a morning moisturizer, an evening moisturizer, an eye cream and a serum, which is designed to slow down the appearance of aging. There are three reasons that I love this stuff. Number one, it smells and feels great. Number two, it's extremely easy to use, completely uncomplicated. They tell you when to use it and exactly how much to use, which I really like because I'm someone who loves a good routine like that. And then reason number three is that it actually works. As I said, I've been using this stuff for about the past six months, and I can really see and feel a difference in how my skin looks. When you look your best, you feel your best too, and TeachHandly has been helping me to do both of those things. When you join TeachHandly, you're gonna get access to a bunch of perks as well, including free US shipping, 25% off the retail price, exclusive access to new products and more. And because TeachHandly is sponsoring today's video, They're offering you guys a great deal. Just click the first link in the description to get the best possible price and a free gift with your first box. You can get started for just $25, which if you've done any research at all for quality skincare products, you know is a great price. Life changing habit number five is to read for 30 to 60 minutes every day. This is all about building in time for yourself and making time for yourself. Getting rid of all those distractions in your life and just focusing for that short amount of time on something to enrich your life. It's amazing to me how inspiring and motivating that time can be. I've certainly found that to be the case. After I read, I'm just so ready to tackle whatever it is I'm after. And I've got like five books that I've either just finished or I'm making my way through or I'm looking forward to starting. I've got this one right here by Donald Miller called Building a Story Brand. And then launch by Jeff Walker. Thanks for the recommendation on this one, Atomic Habits. I have Expert Secrets by Russell Brunson. And finally, Disrupt You by Jay Samet. So you can kind of see where my mind is, but you can totally use this reading time to escape as well. Life changing habit number six is to tidy up your space at the end of the day. I don't know if you're like me, but I do much better. I'm way more productive when my working and living environment is neat. So I'm going to admit that I'm not the best at this, especially in the studio, which just becomes a freaking disaster after we shoot. I mean, you just see this right here, but if you could see around, we're not going to do that. So what I've been trying to do and what has made me feel best at the end of the day, whether we're shooting or I'm just working at my desk, is I take like 10 minutes to neaten everything up. So that way the next day when I come down, I look at how neat my desk is, how neat the studio is, I feel calm, I don't feel anxious at all. And again, that leads me to being more productive throughout the day. Life changing habit number seven is to get seven to eight hours of sleep every night. So I got to admit that it's kind of been nice over this past year plus to not have to get up super early to commute into work. So just trying to hunt the good stuff here. I really like that extra hour that I can spend sleeping, but you know, we've also actually been going to bed at a pretty decent hour, usually between like 930 and 1030 every night. And getting more sleep is good because you just feel refreshed every day. healthier and you have more energy to just straight up accomplish. You know, whether that's exercising or work, getting something done around the house. Life changing habit number eight is to be present. This is one that I really have to work on because no matter how much I get done, how much I accomplish or even how big that accomplishment is, I'm always thinking about what is next. I think that's okay to always be thinking ahead like that, but you need to take time to live in the moment. Be where you are. Take a little bit of time to appreciate that. Slow down for a moment. Don't look at your phone. Take a breath and relax. Life changing habit number nine is to donate. Now this doesn't have to be money. There are other ways that you can donate as well. And donating just makes you feel good. It's kind of hard to describe. I do this by donating my time. So back when I was in high school, I was a member of the Empire State Youth Orchestra in upstate New York, and it had a really powerful impact on me as a musician and as a person. So now they have what they call the Young Leaders Program where they identify 25 really outstanding students and pair them with a mentor. So I volunteer to be a mentor for that program. Pretty much every other week, I spend about an hour talking to my young leader. Feels really good to give back in that way. and it's something that makes my life better as well. Life changing habit number 10 is to exercise three to six times a week. I know everyone tells you that, but having an exercise routine is great for your health, it's great for your energy, it makes you feel better, and it's great for your confidence. I wanna thank Teej Hanley for sponsoring this video once again and remind you to click the link down below in the description to get a free gift with your first order."

        "transcript": " One piece, the classic navy blazer, and three ways to wear it for spring. Look number one is simple, fresh and classic. I've got the navy blazer here paired with a denim shirt, which is one way that I'm dressing it down. And then the other way, of course, is with the white jeans. These are by J.Crew in the 484 fit. I like white jeans a lot as a casual alternative to something like chinos. They've got a sporty vibe, but still feel dressier than even a lighter colored pair of jeans. As I like to do when I wear loafers in the spring with a look like this, go ahead and discuss socks vs. no socks in the comments. I do a single roll on the hem of the jeans. Details here, some classic clubmaster style sunglasses, a simple pocket square, and the Vacheron Constantin traditionale on my wrist. For look number two, I'm keeping it relatively classic and very simple, more or less just your everyday menswear uniform, the navy blazer with a white shirt and some medium gray dress pants. You could easily add a tie to this look to dress it up a bit but I wanted to keep it a little more casual so I decided not to wear the tie. Anytime I have a business casual look like this I do like to wear loafers over lace up shoes. I think it just kind of plays into the overall more casual feel. And these particular penny loafers are by Alan Edmonds. And then I just went with a simple white pocket square to finish it off. Look number three now, can you tell I'm feeling the blazer and jeans thing lately? You know, that's really one of the great parts about owning a classic navy blazer like this because it is one of those jackets that's very easy to style with jeans. I decided to go a little seasonal here with the pink shirt to add in a little color and make it a little more interesting. The light jeans I'm wearing again are by J.Crew, the 484 fit with the roll on the hem and some common projects sneakers. Breaking out one of my favorite warm weather watches, the Tag Heuer Carrera, that was the Rake Magazine's first limited edition. And then, you know, if you want, you could add a hat to make it just a little sportier. This particular Navy Blazer is brand new in the shop, and right now I want to walk you through all of its details. So I really wanted to be able to offer a super classic Navy Blazer because there's just so much that you can do with it. We chose to make it in a Rata Super 110's Traceable Wool. It's a lovely four season fabric with wonderful texture. To be as classic as possible, it's two button with a notch lapel and flap pockets. And you can see the pig stitching that it has on the lapel as well as on the flap. It's a half canvas construction with a double vent and tone on tone lining. And then we went with a classic brass button for that very traditional feel with working buttonholes on the sleeve. As styled here, it is the most classic iteration of a Navy Blazer though, Of course, any of these details can be completely customized, if you like. To check out this jacket, as well as some other spring pieces we've recently added to the shop, click on the link right over there. And if you have any questions, let me know in the comments."

        "transcript": " One piece, three ways, all simple, classic and versatile. Here we go. Look number one. This is for when you want something simple but put together. And it's a great illustration and reminder that you don't have to overthink things. Simplicity always looks good. A khaki cotton blazer, white shirt, and navy cotton pants has got to be one of the most classic spring combinations. The jacket has a notch lapel with a really nice pick stitching. Brown tortoise buttons provide a little bit of contrast and patch pockets. Always recommended styling on a jacket separate for a more relaxed and casual feel which is great especially for a spring jacket. I finished this look off with a simple white cotton pocket square on my wrist is the Vacheron Constantin traditionelle and I anchored this look with a pair of suede tassel loafers which again keep the outfit casual and relaxed. If you're a fan of wearing a blazer with jeans spring is a great time for that and a A khaki cotton blazer is by far one of the easiest jackets to pair with jeans. The fabrics work together and both have such a casual feel to them that it's just a natural fit. I wanted to keep this one light, casual and sporty so I went with my favorite light wash jeans from J.Crew in the 484 fit. And then up top I added a lightweight cashmere crew neck sweater from Falconeri. The fabric elevates the look and feels great but I also love how the appearance is just so simple, almost like an athletic sweatshirt. The finishing touches, I also kept sporty. Watch is my Omega Speedmaster on a brown suede strap. Sunglasses are the Oliver Peoples' Banks and then finished off with some common projects, white leather sneakers. You know, if you Google khaki blazer outfits for men, a good amount of the first image results are from a post we did on the website way back in 2013. And this outfit is sort of my contemporary homage to that post. Still holds up and it really just sort of speaks to how timeless style can be when you're building your wardrobe with simple and versatile pieces. This is another really easy way to pair a khaki blazer with jeans. This one a little more dressed up than the previous because of the darker denim and the button up shirt. I also went with a pair of brown leather derbies here, Vacheron Traditionel on the wrist again and the always stylish Oliver Peoples Banks sunglasses. The classic counterpart to the khaki blazer, of course, khaki pants, and then you can put them together for a great spring summer suit. And both of those videos you see over there are full of more simple and easy to pull off style inspiration. So click there and choose your own adventure for some more spring style ideas."

        "transcript": " In this corner, an undisputed horological icon, clocking in with a 40 millimeter case diameter, bow to the crown, and welcome Rolex GMT Master, Cripsi! And in this corner, all the way from 1979 and back with a vengeance. At 38mm, a retro look with a modern hook. Please welcome, Timex Cune, we wish you. Let's get ready to rumble! I'm Brian Sakao and you're watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. One of the things I said in my recent video featuring the Casio A158W that seemed to really resonate with a lot of you is that it's not how expensive a watch is, that's important, it's how that watch makes you feel. So in the spirit of that, I thought it would be fun to put two watches head to head that look very similar but with very different price points. And in this video we're going to be comparing the Rolex GMT Master II and the Timex Q Reissue. Table of contents for the video. First we'll take a close look at the Rolex, then the Timex. I'll review some similarities and differences between the watches and then we'll put them head to head in a variety of categories including quality, reliability, functionality, comfort, style and price. Let's get to it. So here is the Rolex GMT Master II. This is the reference 16710 and want to give a big shout out to Crown and Caliber for loaning me the watch for this video. It's a 40mm steel case on an oyster bracelet. This model has articulated lugs. It's an automatic movement and the case back is not see through. Moving on to the dial, we've got a black dial with our indices all the way around with the exception of 3 o'clock where you can see the date window magnified by the Cyclops, four minute and running seconds hands and then of course the red GMT hand. The most distinguishing characteristic of this watch is the bezel and specifically the insert. This is the classic red and blue Pepsi bezel, blue indicating night time and red indicating daytime. The bezel rotates both ways and is ringed with 24 hours which is how you would be able to tell time in two different time zones. On the wrist this watch wears and feels great. The bracelet is very comfortable. All in all, it's a classic sports watch with an unmistakable look and a great history as well introduced in 1954 for Pan Am pilots making intercontinental flights. Next we have a watch that looks very similar to the GMT Master. This is the Timex Q-Reissue. This is a modern version of a watch that was first introduced in 1979 during the so-called Quartz Crisis that really forced the mechanical watch industry to kind of reevaluate itself. This watch here has a 38mm stainless steel case and a woven stainless steel bracelet, both of which being 100% true to the original. The case has a brushed appearance on the top and a polished appearance on the side. It is powered by a quartz movement and you can see on the case back where the battery is housed. The dial is blue and the cue above the Timex signature does stand for quartz. Our indices all the way around except at 3 o'clock where we've got apertures showing both the day and the date. There's an hour hand, a minute hand, and a red seconds hand. The bezel rotates both ways and is ringed with 12 hour time. Now we do have the blue and red on the bezel, but with the absence of a GMT hand, I'm not sure how useful that is. At 38mm, this watch sits really well on the wrist. I feel like 38mm is really such a sweet spot in terms of size. It's very comfortable, though the bracelet does seem to catch and pull on my arm hair a bit. It feels pretty substantial, which was a little unexpected to me, but definitely a pleasant surprise. Now that we've had an overview of both watches, let's take a look at some of the similarities and differences between the two of them. Starting off with the similarities. Both have a stainless steel case and bracelet. Of course, both have hour, minute, and seconds hands. Both have luminescent hour indices, and both have a rotating bezel with the distinctive blue and red coloring. Differences. Case size. The Rolex is 40 millimeters and the Timex 38 millimeters. Movement is different as well. Rolex being mechanical and automatic. Timex quartz. The Rolex has just a date window while the Timex has both the day and the date. There's a GMT hand on the Rolex, not on the Timex. The bezel on the Rolex displays 24 hours, Timex 12 hours, and then the bracelet style. The Rolex having the oyster bracelet and the Timex having a woven bracelet. However, there is a modification you can do with the Timex bracelet that a few of you picked up on in the Casio video I did. And that is if you take the bracelet from the Casio A158W and put it on the Timex, it actually gives it a much closer resemblance to the Rolex. Now we're going to see how these watches stack up head to head. And our first category is quality. You know, it's kind of hard to objectively compare quality when you're dealing with watches at such disparate price points. Obviously, if you're paying a premium, you expect a certain level of quality, but that doesn't mean that a lower price point watch can't be quality as well. The Timex is certainly quality for what it is. However, the bracelet, in my opinion, takes away from that quality, so in the quality category, point goes to Rolex. Next category is reliability. Although Rolex makes some excellent movements that are superlative chronometer certified, There really is no comparison with a course movement when it comes to accuracy and reliability. So point to Timex. Our next category is functionality. Both watches have their own set of jobs that they perform. The Timex has both the day and the date displayed. The Rolex, just the date. However, the Rolex does have the GMT hand, which I feel is more unique and useful. So I'm going to go point to Rolex in the functionality category. Now we're going to talk about comfort. Both watches feel great on the wrist. However, again, the bracelet on the Timex does tend to pull on my hair. So Rolex comes out on top here in terms of comfort. Point to Rolex. Next category is style. From a distance, you know, these watches look so similar, especially if you do the bracelet modification I suggested on the Timex. The Rolex is of course the original, but the Timex has some great retro style. So no clear winner here. We're gonna give a point to both. Final category is price. The Rolex GMT Master II that I have here, the reference 16710, you can currently find at $12,000 to $15,000. The Timex retails for $179, no contest on price, point to Timex. Now you can see in my rating that Rolex did come out slightly on top, but that in no way diminishes the incredible value that the Timex Q reissue offers. So if a Rolex GMT Master II really isn't in your price range, but you like the look, I think the Timex is a great alternative. However, I would highly recommend the Casio A158W bracelet modification, both from a comfort standpoint, as well as a style standpoint. The Casio is only a $19 watch, and it's a pretty cool watch itself, so much so that it has earned a permanent place in my watch collection.

        "transcript": " All right, the biggest trend in menswear is not what you think. It's not a specific brand, it's not a specific color, it's not a specific pattern. The biggest trend in menswear right now is a specific approach to dressing. And in this video, I'm gonna share what that is, why I like it so much, and how you can pull it off. [\"Dress Well\"] I'm Brian Sakawa, and you are watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. So one of the biggest shifts that I've seen as a trend in menswear is a move towards a more casual and relaxed approach. Obviously this past year there haven't been as many opportunities for people to dress up. Working from home has definitely contributed to that. But the trend towards more casual tailoring has been something that's been going on for at least the last two years. This is something I personally really like and I think is a great development for menswear in in general for two specific reasons. Reason number one is that it takes the stigma away and removes a barrier to entry for a lot of people who might be interested in getting into menswear, but only think of menswear as being a suit and tie kind of thing. People who want a more put together and tailored look, but don't necessarily have the occasion to wear a suit all the time. Reason number two is that I feel like it democratizes menswear to a certain extent. So by shedding that super buttoned up suit tie connotation, it introduces the power of menswear to a wider variety of people and shows them that even if they have a more casual overall style, that there are many different approaches within menswear or tailored clothing. And that casual approach is what I'm going to be highlighting here with one specific item, the shirt jacket. Going to give you a little bit of an overview of that before we jump into some quick outfit ideas. A shirt jacket or a shacket, as it's sometimes called, is exactly what it sounds like. a hybrid between a shirt and a jacket. So it's going to be a thicker fabric than a shirt, but not quite as bulky as a jacket, which makes it really great as a transition piece as we are coming into spring. And from a style perspective, it's less dressy than a blazer, which if you've been looking for a more casual, but still tailored piece of outerwear makes it one of the best options out there. We've actually just released a spring collection of shirt jackets in the HSS shop. There is a link in the description to check them out. All of our shirt jackets are in what what I would call a safari style. So they've got four pleated pockets with a nice stitching around the flaps, a camp collar, a single button cuff, and all of our shirt jackets are online. So they're a really nice, lightweight spring outerwear option. We're currently offering five different pieces in three different fabrics. There's a khaki and navy and a heavyweight cotton twill, a camel and olive and a stretch corduroy, and then a black and white herringbone and a beautiful Irish linen. They're available in off the rack sizing or custom sizing if you prefer. And again, you can check them out with the link in the description. Now let's take a look at how to style them. Since I'm building this as menswear trending more casual, starting off with a super casual look, got some light wash jeans, tan crew neck sweater, which by the way is from Everlane. And as an aside, if you're considering Everlane, I would definitely size up as I've found their sizing to run kind of small. going with a classic white leather sneaker here, and then the navy shirt jacket to complete the look. It's classic and simple, very versatile, and really pretty much a do anything casual outfit. Moving on to our khaki cotton shirt jacket here, and with this outfit, I really wanted to highlight the shirt jacket as a casual alternative to a blazer. You can see that the foundation of this look is very classic, got a white OCBD up top, paired with some navy cotton trousers. doesn't get easier than that. Now, you could very easily put on a blazer with this outfit, but that would definitely change the vibe. The shirt jacket, on the other hand, makes it more casual, a little sporeier, and you still have some great details, like the pleated pockets, or a little menswear flair. This is the dressiest look of the bunch, and again, another way you can use a shirt jacket as a substitute for a blazer to achieve a more casual and sporty feel. I love how such a simple change or substitution can have such a dramatic effect. The foundation of the outfit here, striped shirt, navy chinos, is a simple, easy and classic combo. And then the tie, because it is a club style tie, adds a bit of a preppy feel, which I think plays into the sportiness of the shirt jacket. Here is our camel colored corduroy shirt jacket. I know corduroy, you might think, is more of a fall fabric choice, but this particular fabric that we use is a little bit more lightweight, making it perfect for a winter to spring transition piece. From a style standpoint, it's got a bit of a rugged vibe, which is why I decided to pair it with some dark denim jeans along with a brown gingham shirt. I really like how the brown of the shirt complements the camel color of the shirt jacket. And then for the shoes, I chose a light brown leather derby. So we've got three different browns kind of all working together here. And next is an olive version of this piece. And for this look, I really tried to lean into the safari shirt aspect of the styling details with a color palette that is more safari-ish, I guess you would say. Underneath is a light tan net pullo, which we've also got available in the shop. It's very unique in that it has a very strong collar, so it stands up well, and a deep five-button placket, which you don't see that often. Spring's a great time to bring out the white denim, which I paired with some suede boots to play into the rugged feel of the corduroy, and then a great pair of aviators and pre-bond seamaster to complete the look. All the shirt jackets I featured in this video are now live and available in the shop. We're really happy with where we were able to price them all. I think they're a really great value, especially considering that you have the option for a complete custom fit.

        "transcript": " It's interesting being online like this because although we have this connection and you get to know me over time and I tell you stories from my life, I realized that paints a picture of me and oftentimes an incomplete picture. So I was curious and that's why I put out a call on Instagram to ask what your assumptions about me were. Now I honestly thought that I was going to be able to make this a top 10 assumptions about me video, but there was a really wide variety of responses. So I'm going to go through a bunch of them and let you know whether they're true or false. And there was one that did come up again and again and again, but I'm going to save that one. The biggest assumption about me to the end. So be sure to stick around. Your short. That's interesting because I typically people think I'm tall. I'm 5'9\", 175 centimeters, which is an average height. It's not tall, but I wouldn't say short, so that's false. You like putting clothing on yourself. Well, since I'm not a nudist, that is true. That you're a clean freak. I wish I was. I like things neat, but I'm not meticulous, kind of obsessive, compulsive about that, so that is false. Hell of a saxophonist. I mean, not to toot my own horn, but I'm a pretty good saxophonist, so that's true. Your haircut is at least $30. That is false. I go to a barber that is just off an army base and the haircut costs $14 so with tip I spend $20 per haircut. You enjoy a good whiskey and cigar every now and then. That's true. Although I haven't smoked a cigar in quite a while, it's been cold and I don't know, I just haven't done it, but true. You hate casual clothes. False. I like casual clothes. I mean, I guess this isn't casual, but I dress casually too, not just what you see on the channel. You are an introvert. I think so, but it's weird because I definitely prefer, I don't mind being alone. I hate large groups of people, but I do like the company of people. So I'm like kind of an introvert, but not really, I'm gonna say that's false. You were a loser in high school. I, false. I wasn't like in the popular crowd or whatever, but I wasn't like a loser. I kind of went between a bunch of different groups of people, but definitely I wouldn't have considered myself a loser. You have never been in a fight. We're talking about a fist fight that is true. I like this one. You are a bad dancer. 100% true. Very opinionated, not rude, but will not suffer fools. I think if you follow the comments of the channel, you will know that that is true. Very well organized. When I put my mind to it, that is true. But it does take effort to be organized and I think, you know, I like getting organized but sometimes it's a struggle to kind of keep the organization up, especially when things are moving around all over the place and, you know, like that. But you should check out our folder structure for media management. It's pretty cool. Very organized. You are not into cars that much. That's true. I like cars, but I'm not really a car guy. A wealthy musician living in New York. Well, I am a musician, but I don't live in New York, so false. You dig Jackie McLean. For those of you who don't know, Jackie McLean was a famous jazz alto saxophonist. Actually, I never liked Jackie McLean. So that's false. And I just, I didn't like Jackie McLean's playing because he played so sharp on purpose, he says, because he said that if he played sharp, it would make his tone cut through more. And I just couldn't stand listening to him. What is this? You iron your bedding. It's a struggle to make the bed for me sometimes. And so that is false. You have an encyclopedic knowledge of classic films and jazz. That's partially true. I would say that I know a lot about jazz, but I don't have the same depth of knowledge about classic films. So we gotta call that one a draw. Okay, this one's kind of funny. You're a huge stoner, that's false, but he says, just kidding, You seem like a really great guy. What are you saying? Great guys can't be stoners? Bad sense of humor. I mean, what's a good sense of humor? I think I have a weird sense of humor, but I don't think that's bad, so that's false. You're a good guy that is into luxury, but not pretentious about it. I would say that is definitely true. I like nice things, but I don't look down on people who don't have that stuff. Underneath the sophisticated exterior, you have a goofy side. That is 100% true. Meticulous. True. British. British. Do I sound British to you? False. You'd never wear Jordans slash Yeezys. I don't know what Yeezys are, so I'm gonna say that's true. I always just assumed you were a doctor of some sort, medical or otherwise. That is almost true, but it's false. I did do all of the work for the Doctor of Musical Arts degree, however I did not complete it. Well I did complete the work, but I needed to, I went through the program quicker than I was supposed to, and you accrued these fee hours, which are basically like a residency requirement, then I wasn't in residence long enough to accrue those fee hours. So if I wanted to get my doctorate, I would have to pay for it. And honestly, there's other things I would rather do with that money than purchase a piece of paper to put on the wall. So I assume that you have Mr. Rogers as a role model. you can almost be too nice. I just try to be nice to people but Mr. Rogers, I love Mr. Rogers, not my one role model I would choose so I'm gonna say false. Freak? I don't know what that means. But I'm going to say, false. Swear is more than we get to see on camera. That's false because I really don't swear all that much just occasionally in the car if someone's driving like a moron. You like big butts and you cannot lie. That's true. Yeah, I do like butts. I'm more of a butt man than a boob man. Don't work much. That's funny. I mean, some vibe I must give off must make you think that. But that is 100% false. You want to make more watch-related content. That's an interesting assumption. Because I love making watch videos, but I also hate making watch videos because it's so involved to do. Shooting B-roll literally takes an entire day. So I don't know. Kind of true, kind of false. I wouldn't want it to replace anything. So let's just call that one a draw too. That you might like a sneaky chocolate bar when nobody's looking. Have you been talking to Robin? Because that is true. I'm a chocolate fiend. If it's in the house, I will eat it and I deliberately try to make sure that there is no chocolate in the house so I don't eat it. You left the army field band. That is false. I am still in the Army Field Band. You may have seen one of the recent shows where I was hosting, it was a Valentine's Day show, and I was right here pretty much with the same setup only, wearing my uniform, so that is false. Did I say that already? You're secretly nerdy about comic books. That, false. I don't even really like superhero movies, so yeah. You live a disciplined life and follow a consistent morning routine. Yes, true. That you're regretting selling your 5711 now. I know by the time this comes out that I will have put out a video addressing that question, but spoiler alert, false. You've never been to Poland. That is true and I am Polish actually. It would be cool to go there at some point. If you're curious, Sakała is Polish. There used to be a Z in the name. There was a Z after the C, so it was S-A-C-Z-A-W-A. And according to people I've talked to, depending on where my family was from in Poland, they could either be pronounced Sachawa or Sonsawa. I think that's pretty cool, but somewhere along the line, We lost a Z and I'm Sakawa. You like fruity cocktails. I mean like every once in a while, like in the summer, maybe on vacation, but typically that would be like 99.9% of the time that is false. No dishes can stay in the sink. I was just gonna say like if it was just me living here that would be false but now it's true. I'm bad about it. You're a fan of classic noir films. That's true. Actually, a lot of them recently, Maltese Falcon, and what's the one with Barbara Stanwyck? Oh, Double Indemnity. Yeah, that's a really good one. And what's the one with Jack Nicholson? Chinatown? Would that be considered classic? I think so. Yeah, true. You like Carpano Antica more than Kochi Vermouth de Torino. I do like Carpano Antica and I do like Kochi Vermouth Diterino as well. They're so similar but I can't say that I like one or the other so false. You enjoy grilled cheese sandwiches. I just had half of one yesterday because Robin made some tomato soup and she made a grilled cheese sandwich with it, but I try not to eat stuff like that ever, but I did just because it was really cold and felt like the thing to do. So whether or not I enjoy grilled cheese sandwiches, I guess that would be true, though I don't eat them hardly ever. That you are a perfectionist. Yeah, we'll cave that away. That's true. You wear suits to bed in a pajama fabric, of course. I do, that's false. I do not wear suits to bed though. I do wear pajamas to bed. I did invest in a nice silk pair from Bud in London and they're awesome. You are very professional on camera. Well, thank you. But when you are alone with Robin, you like to be babied. Yeah, true, especially when I'm sick. That you wear velvet loafers to bed. No, that's false. I don't wear velvet loafers to bed. I don't wear socks in bed either. Apparently that's a sign of serial killers, I'm told. But I do like velvet slippers, though typically what I'm wearing around the house are not velvet slippers, but they're, right now I have on these Belgian shoes and they're wool. Coming from a fellow Libra, I assume you're very particular. You really know me and that is true. You love good music. Yes, that's true. You decide who to trust based on their use of Rob in their name, Rob photographer, Robin wife. Well, you know, we've got other people on the team. We've got Ian and Rachel and Tony as well. So that's gonna make that one false. You don't like sports. That is false. I grew up playing sports. I played baseball, I played tennis, I bowled. Fun fact, I was the New York State junior bowling champion in 1995, that's right. And I bowled one 300 game. And I also threw a no-hitter when I was 12 years old in Little League. So I do like sports a lot, I particularly like baseball. I'm a Red Sox fan, I don't really follow basketball or football, or soccer, or I guess some of you call that football. I don't follow American football or your football. But, and I'd still do really like cycling. I love watching cycling even though I don't race anymore. Brown is your favorite color? It's one of them. I don't know. It's like a real close toss up between, Yeah, yeah, I guess maybe it is, so that's true. You wear crocs when no one can see it. You know, funny thing about that, because I have a real, I have like this allergic reaction to crocs. They make me growl and I don't like them at all. False. You have about 600 suits with matching shoes. Last count, I was at about 500 or something. No, no, I don't have that many suits. Maybe like 40 or 50. All not with matching shoes, so that is false. You're never content. Always strive to do and be better than before. That's true. pushing forward and wanting to improve and take it to the next level. Obsessed with details. True. Young Brian wasn't into style. That is false. I always, I was always into it. I liked it. I just didn't know how to do it back then necessarily. So yeah. You don't understand irony. Uh, dude, I am Gen X, so irony is like in my body, my being, so false. You're an only child. True. And I know the follow-up question will be, do you ever wish you had like a brother or sister? And the answer is no. You have a hot wife, I mean, duh. True. Okay, so the biggest assumption, here we are, the biggest assumption about me is that I, variation on a theme here is that I either come from money, affluent family, that I'm wealthy, and I was talking with Robin about this, and it's, I wouldn't say, when I think of wealthy people and fabulously wealthy people, I would say that that is false. Like we're very lucky. Robin has a full-time job. I have a full-time job in addition to doing he spoke style, but I didn't, my family wasn't wealthy. My father was very good about saving money and we always had what we needed. So it wasn't like I came from affluence and we had all these fancy cars and stuff like that. No, I lived in a middle class suburban neighborhood and didn't go to private school, none of that kind of stuff. So, and now, Robin and I are lucky to be very comfortable and money is, always would be better to have more, right? But it's not something we have to worry about, but I wouldn't necessarily say that we are like fabulously wealthy and things like that. I do get to do a lot of things that are, from He Spoke style, I've gotten to drive like these crazy cars and stuff like that, but that's like not my life. It's fun to be able to do that, but that's not like parked in my garage right now. I have like a small little, my little car that I drive around in the summer is an MG Midget. It's not like an old Mercedes Gullwing or something like that. So that I've come from a wealthy family or that we are just like stinking, filthy rich, that's false. So this was really fun to do. And honestly, I didn't really think about how to wrap up this video. So I'm just gonna kind of leave it there. And thanks for watching. And I hope that answered all of your questions."

        "transcript": " I discovered the most interesting thing recently and I actually found it really surprising. I know that nearly 60% of you who watch this channel are in your 20s. YouTube analytics tells me that. I just found that really interesting because I'm not your age, but I'm not so old that I don't remember my 20s. I know exactly how you guys think, you think you're invincible, you think you'll never get old and you think that there are things that you just don't have to think about. Well, take it from me as someone who's been there done that, that's not the case. There are plenty of things now looking back that I wish I knew when I was in my 20s and I'm gonna share five of those things with you today. So hopefully, hopefully you can learn from my mistakes. I'm Brian Sakawa and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration. You need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. So I wanna start off talking about style because this is a style focused channel. Now, I know a lot of you probably assume that I've always known how to dress well and that it came easy to me. But let me tell you, that is not the case. And the first thing I wish I knew in my 20s was to have a better understanding of how to build a versatile wardrobe that I could actually do something with. So I know this sounds crazy if you look at what it is that I do now. And I always knew what I wanted, but I didn't know how to get there. I was focused more on individual pieces rather than stepping back and looking at the big picture. So what would happen was I'd think I need some pants. So I'd go to the mall and buy a pair of pants or two pairs of pants. I'd think I need a shirt. So I'd go buy a shirt. And eventually I had all these individual things that just didn't go together. So when that happens to you, that's when you're like, I don't have anything to wear and you go out and buy something else and the cycle just continues. I'm ashamed to admit that it took me way too long to get to the point where I really understood the value of starting with the basics, making a plan, making a budget, and then gradually, gradually, because it does take time adding those pieces and then feeling like, yes, this actually isn't that hard and I can do this. If you've watched the channel for a long time, you already know these things because it's something I talk about all the time. But if you happen to be new to the channel and you do want to know where to get started, I highly recommend clicking on that video right up there where I take you through the 25 essential items I think every guy should start with. All right, next. You see these lines? Yeah, take a close look at them. They're inevitable as you age. But for me, they would probably be a little less pronounced if I had taken better care of my skin more consistently, which is the second thing I wish I knew or had done in my 20s. The reason I was never really able to commit to a good skincare routine is just because it seems so complicated, like there are so many aspects to it that it was just hard to know exactly what I was supposed to do, but more importantly, like what I needed to do. My wife takes incredible care of her skin. She has all these products and she knows exactly how to use them and what order to use them, but I'm not that advanced. But if someone said, this is exactly what you need to do, I'm the type of person that can follow instructions like that, which is one of the reasons I'm really excited to partner with our sponsor for today's video, Teej Hanley. I feel like this whole system that they have was made exactly for someone like me. I've been using the level three advanced, advanced, because I'm old, kit, which includes a facial cleanser, a face scrub, a morning moisturizer, an evening moisturizer, an eye cream, and a serum, which is designed to slow down the appearance of aging. The best part about it from my perspective, other than that it smells and feels amazing and that it actually works, is that they tell you exactly when to use it and how much to use, which makes that routine aspect of it really easy to get into. I love having a checklist like that. You know, I've had a problem recently with, I guess it's because it's been cold and dry, where this part of my face between my eyebrows was actually getting really dry and splotchy. And since I've been using the T-Channel products, I have not had any issues with that at all, which is super awesome. I've had really great success with this, and if my story sounds kind of like yours, and you've been looking for a way to get started with a good skincare routine, T-Channel is offering you guys a free Dopp kit with your first order. And all you have to do is to click the link down below in the description to get started for just $25. I didn't mention before, but the price for this stuff is really amazing as well, and they have some great membership benefits, including always saving 25% off the retail price. Free US shipping all the time, again, link down below to get started. My wife, Robin, loves to tell a certain story about me. We weren't married yet, and she was still living in New York City, and I was up visiting. We were out and about, and then she just wanted to sit on a bench and do nothing. And that type of stasis, which some might call relaxation, has never been something that resonated with me. I recognize that now and the benefits of that now and I'm better about it, but in my 20s that was something I never even thought about. I was constantly pushing, constantly working, like just very focused on whatever it was that I was doing or learning or practicing. And to the point where I felt that if I let up and didn't focus and didn't work so hard that I would fall behind and possibly never even achieve what I wanted to. I think it's okay to be super focused like that, but what I've learned is that you have to build in time to take a break. Burnout is real and it's the worst thing ever. It could even put you in a position where you actually start hating the thing that you love to do in the first place. I experienced this to varying degrees, but luckily I never got to the point where I just wanted to completely quit. It's a dangerous and kind of scary situation to find yourself in, and it's really something I wish I had a better understanding of back in my 20s. The next thing I wish I knew in my 20s kind of goes hand in hand with what I was just talking about, being like super focused, head down, seriously consumed with what I was striving to achieve. At that time for me, that was music. The saxophone, music history, musicology, learning all the crazy music that I used to play back then. Going to that place mentally is really important, I think, to becoming an expert or getting close to mastery of a particular field or any kind of pursuit. But what I wish I could have done better back then was to see the bigger picture and to be able to articulate and really understand why I was doing this. I knew that I loved music. I loved playing for people. I loved pushing boundaries and really kind of trying to innovate. But by not looking outside and doing things more or less in a vacuum, eventually it became like, I don't understand. What is this all about? What I know now and can articulate now is that I love connecting with people. I love bringing people together around shared beliefs and that what I do has the power to change people's lives. I understand that with music. I understand that with what I do here on the channel. And once I found out the why of what I was doing, it really gave me a sense of purpose, a sense of grounding, and the feeling that I was doing something that was bigger than myself. So I would encourage you to think about not what you do or how you do it, but to really dig into the why. Because if you do that and can get to the bottom of it, I guarantee you will have a very powerful moment transformation. One of the things I always wanted to do in my 20s and I kind of regret not doing was to move to New York City to do the musician thing up there. I mean that was the hub of all the activity. There were just so many creative people there, so many opportunities. It just seemed so exciting but it was a risk. I never took that risk but I did take a different risk. So I was really lucky to win a job as a saxophonist with the Army Field Band in 1999, but you know, at the time I was 21 years old, didn't really want to settle into a career at that age. There was still so much I wanted to do, I thought. So after three years, I decided to leave this secure job that I had to go to graduate school, study the saxophone more and possibly get a teaching job at a university. So that was a risk that I took. I wasn't moving to New York, but it was a risk and it was scary to do. I don't regret it at all. It all worked out fine, but looking back on it, what I would share with you is that you'll probably have these opportunities to take risks. Don't be afraid to take a risk, but I think it's very important to weigh the factors associated with that risk. So although you'll be taking a leap and doing something that scares you and is uncomfortable, try just try to see a way forward before you make the decision so you can have some kind of plan before you jump in. be open to things as they happen, but I think you'll feel better about your decision like I did if you take the time to kind of map it out a little bit. I wanna thank TeachHanley for sponsoring this video once again and to remind you to click the link down below in the description to get a free Dopp Kit with your first order. I was really blown away by this stuff and I think if you have struggled to commit to a skincare routine that this could really be a great option for you.

        "transcript": " I know what you're thinking and know this is not a joke. This little inexpensive Casio A158W is my absolute favorite watch right now. So with watches in my collection from Rolex, Vacheron, and Lange, why on earth would I buy a $19 watch, right? Well, I'm going to tell you why I bought it and also why I cannot take it off my wrist. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. This video is sponsored by Casio. Just kidding, that is a joke too. Do not hit the thumbs down. This video is not a sponsored video. So yeah, the story. I'll get to the story and actually something a little bit deeper, but before we get to that, I do want to go over all the details of this watch and give you a closer look at it. So this is the Casio A158W. The case is made from silver resin and has a diameter of 34 millimeters, a thickness of 8.5 millimeters, and a lug to lug width of 38 millimeters. Case back is stainless steel, where you can see the brand stamped, and model number 593, which makes it very similar to the popular F91W. The linked bracelet is also stainless steel, and it has a quartz movement with a battery life of around seven years. One of the cool things that I like between the case and the bracelet is that the case has a polished appearance while the bracelet has a more brushed appearance. Some people might not like that, but for me, it's a nice contrast that adds some subtle visual interest. On the dial here, we've got a crisp LCD screen, which displays the time, hours, minutes, and running seconds. And you can easily toggle between 12 hour time and 24 hour time with the pusher on the right. Above the time kind of between the hours and minutes, have the day of the week and then over to the right above the seconds is the date. The screen does have a backlight that you operate with the top pusher on the left side of the case but honestly it's very weak and only really provides any kind of value in near complete or complete darkness. Not very useful but one of its charms more on that later. With the bottom pusher on the left you can cycle through the watch's various operations. This is the alarm function, then the stopwatch, which is very intuitive to use. Start stop on the right and reset on the top left. And then finally, you get to where you can set the date and time. On the wrist, this watch is just an absolute joy to wear. I mentioned the size, which makes it ideal for those of us with smaller wrists. And what I also like about that is that unlike the G-Shock, which gets a ton of attention and really calls attention to itself. The A158W is a much more subtle piece. It's very light so you basically don't even know you're wearing it. And really the best part about this watch, other than the price at just $19, is the look. It's got a great retro style and feel, which if you grew up in the 80s, like me, really gets those nostalgia juices flowing. So that brings us back to the question of why did I buy this watch? Now the honest truth is that I actually bought this watch for another video that is coming up in a couple of weeks. I'm going to be doing a series of videos comparing cheap or inexpensive watches with the real luxury watches that they are trying to emulate. Anyway, the ironic thing is that I didn't buy this watch for the watch itself. I bought it for the bracelet and you'll see in a couple of weeks this bracelet makes a really good substitute for another bracelet on another watch that moves that watch even closer to looking like the real thing. More to follow. But a funny thing happened when I got this Casio in the mail and opened it up. Now, mind you, the experience of opening up and unboxing a Casio A158W is very different than your luxury watch unboxing experience. Instead of a big ornate box with latches and velvet and little drawers with thick manuals and laminated cards, it comes in basically a little cardboard jewelry box and a manual with a few pages that are folded over on each other. In fact, it was so unimpressive that I threw the packaging out pretty much immediately. Of course, I wasn't looking for or expecting a luxury watch unboxing experience from a $19 watch, but the experience I had was almost better. Opening the packaging and taking this watch out brought me back to a time when I was a kid. It brought me back to that Timex Iron Man that I love so much. It brought me back to that neon swatch with the rotating bezel, inexpensive watches, but watches that brought me so much joy and still have meaning to me today. And if you're into watches, you know, isn't that what it's all about? I wanted to bring that up in the context of this video because I feel like sometimes, especially when people get a first taste of higher end watches, that you can kind of fall into the trap of looking down on watches that are literally cheap. Like if you're not paying a lot of money, then the watch isn't worth anything, right? I do kind of want to open up this can of worms here because I've certainly been guilty of some minor watch snobbery here and there. And for me personally, you know, that has typically revolved around fashion watches and fashion watch brands, which are a whole other thing that I do plan to do kind of a pretty deep dive into at some point in the near future on the channel. But it's just because like I'm the type of person that believes in being patient when it comes to not only the watches I buy for myself, but the other things that I invest in as well. I feel like we have this instant gratification culture where we see something and we want it now. That's totally natural, but I feel like it leads to people wasting their money on things that are cheap and less expensive than probably what they really want. But if you were just a little more disciplined and patient, above all else, that you might actually be able to attain in the future. I wasn't expecting to like this watch as much as I did and it really taught me a lesson about what watches really mean. It's not about having the most expensive watch. It's not about having the flashiest watch. I mean, maybe for some people it is, but real watch people, real watch people, don't care about that crap. It's about how the watch makes you feel. It's the story behind it. It's the joy that it brings to you. It's not about the price tag. Does this mean that I'm gonna have a whole collection of Casio watches? No, but I really like this one. It will definitely feature in my next watch collection video.

        "transcript": " Listen, there are a lot of decisions you have to make when you're getting a custom suit and the sheer number of choices you have over every single detail can be completely overwhelming. One of the things that I found to be most difficult to decide on over the years has been how to choose a lining for a jacket. So in this video, I'm going to take you through the five different options you have and why you might choose one over the other to help you make not only the best decision for you, but one that you will not regret. I'm Brian Sakao and you're watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Now before we get into the five options you have when it comes to suit jacket linings, let's first go over the five purposes of aligning. Number one, lining your suit jacket or sport coat adds weight and structure to the garment. Two, it makes it warmer, which helps make it more comfortable and cooler weather. Three, if you have a lining in your jacket, it's gonna sit better on your body, which could help reduce the possibility of the fabric bunching up. Four, a lining is gonna hide the inner construction of the jacket. And you could argue that actually seeing how the jacket is assembled and stitched together is kind of cool, but if you want a very clean look, a lining will help with that. And finally, a lining can help make the jacket easier to put on. So if you've ever had a basted fitting where it's just the unlined fabric on your body, you know how it can kind of pull on your shirt and be a bit difficult to actually get down your arm or around your body when you're putting it on. So if you have that lining, which is typically made with a breathable, light, durable, and silky feeling material called BEMBURG, that's what helps get the jacket on smoothly and easily. Now the biggest choice you are going to have to make before deciding on which lining you wanna get is to figure out what the intent is. Do you want something that's versatile, or are you looking for something with a little more personality? That is a decision that is completely up to you, but as I take you through each of the five options, I think you'll start to zero in and get a feel for what makes sense and what is most comfortable for you. The first and most simple option is what's called tone on tone. This is where the lining of the jacket is pretty much the exact same color as the jacket itself. It's an extremely versatile option. It doesn't call attention to itself. It's a very easy choice to make. So if you're someone who's looking for something that's timeless, subtle, and under the radar, I think this is a great choice for you. And it's actually how I style the majority of my suit jackets and sport coats. Now, tone on tone doesn't have to be so plain, and there are ways that you can do tone on tone, but still have a little more subtlety and interest. If you take a look at the lining of my hopsack suit here, you can see that there's a very subtle paisley print. So if you want that classic look with a little something special, This is something I would definitely consider. Your next option is to use a contrasting or complementary color. This is going to be a little bit bolder. It will stand out a little bit more, but it doesn't necessarily have to be completely ostentatious or flamboyant. This is a good choice if you want something in that classic realm, but with a little more personality. And also if you have, let's say, something like a Glen Plaid with a thin line of color running through it, that could be a really good color to pull out with your choice of lining. To figure out which contrasting or complimentary color combinations you'd like best, you can go online and find these color wheel generators where you're able to pick your primary color, which in this instance would be your suit fabric color, and then generate other colors that pair well and harmoniously with that color. I also really recommend this small Japanese book called A Dictionary of Color Combinations. It's got tons of different color palettes and is just a really great source of inspiration for finding colors that work together. I'll link to both the website and the book down below in the description. Your third option is what I'm going to call a non-statement pattern. Typically on the subtle side, classic patterns like herringbone, stripes, checks, or polka dots for example. These are great choices for that timeless looking style with a little bit of, I guess you'd say, classic menswear flair. The thing that's difficult to kind of envision when you're considering a pattern like this is that when you're just looking at that little fabric swatch, it can seem really bold. But when you actually see it fully lining the jacket, oftentimes you don't even see the pattern itself. From a distance, it just looks like a nice texture or a bit of contrast. It really is one of the most difficult things to imagine. So it can be beneficial to see a couple of options like this in person to get a sense of how it will look on the finished garment. Option number four is a statement pattern. We're talking big, bold, and eye catching. So like a big gingham check, a bold plaid, damask, a tropical motif, even a larger picture. You know, if you're someone who's really outgoing, big personality, it likes to be unique and show off that personality through your clothing, this is a great option for you. But even if you're not that kind of person, I still think it's something to at least consider. Take me for example, I like very simple pieces with classic styling, typically choosing tone on tone, but there are a couple of garments that I have with the more statement lining. Take this tweed sport coat. The lining I chose for this is a very bold paisley, bold in terms of size, but it works with this particular jacket because it is such a singular and unique piece. So choosing a lining that kind of complimented that uniqueness was an obvious choice for me. And it's nice to have one or two pieces that really do have that little something special. Option number five is to go full custom. This is where you can get whatever you want on your lining. Some companies like Michael Andrews for example allow you to upload your own image which is then imprinted on the lining making for an extremely unique piece. If you want to have something custom and personal and special and truly unique in that way you really can't do any better than a fully custom lining. Now choosing a lining is just one of the many many decisions you're gonna have to make when you are buying a custom suit and the bad news is that none of them get any easier. Over the years through the many custom suit experiences I've had, I've really dialed in what I like and have figured out how to guide people going through that process. And I've rounded up those tips for you and that playlist right over there. So if you're ready to jump into a custom suit and have questions about how to make the right decisions, I think you'll find many of the answers you're looking for by clicking there."

        "transcript": " You know how it goes right at the time, seemed like a great idea, and then after you're like, what was I thinking? We've all made purchases like that and I'm no different. So today I'm actually going to share five of the things that I have regretted buying the most. I'm Brian Sokow and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. So you know I'm a big fragrance lover and you also know that I like nice fragrances and one of my favorite things about fragrance is that there's always something new to discover. You know, I always have the ones that I go back to but it's the thrill of the hunt for something new and unique and special that really excites me. And one of the fragrances that started creeping into my mind and peaking my interest was one from a house that I was familiar with having seen it and smelled it in some higher end department stores over the years, but one that I never actually went ahead to purchase for myself. So the particular fragrance that captured my attention was Baccarat Rouge 540 by Maison Franciece Courquejean. Never smelled it, never seen it in the store, but as I was going down one of my fragrance rabbit holes, it was one that started to sound really interesting. For one, Baccarat. I mean beautiful crystal, lovely hotel in New York, great bar where Robin and I have I've enjoyed a few cocktails that were a little too expensive. So it had that allure to it already. Of course, having no idea what it smelled like, I read every review I could find in all the usual places, watch whatever video I could find, basically to try and convince myself that this was a good choice. I wasn't completely sold on it based on what I was hearing and what I was reading. Just kinda didn't sound like something that was me. People said it was kind of orangy on the sweeter side, but the thing that intrigued me the most and ultimately swayed me to make the purchase. This was a complete blind buy. Was the fact that people were saying that it was transparent. So I don't think I'd ever experienced a transparent fragrance before. So yes, I spent too much money. Should have gone with my gut, not a fragrance for me. I don't like how it smells on me, but not a total loss though, because Robin actually likes it and I like how it smells on her. Next is the story of a mistake I made very early on when I started to get more serious about putting time and effort into how I dressed. It's a mistake that I believe is unavoidable for anyone who gets into this kind of thing. The full video for that is right up there. I wanted to be different. I wanted to show people that I was in the know. And one of the brands that at the time for me really stood for that was the Black Fleece line by Brooks Brothers. Black Fleece was designed by Tom Brown, known for the quote unquote shrunken suit. And like a lot of his tailored stuff, it was classic but definitely had his modern take on what men's tailoring should be. The shirts were phenomenal off the rack shirts. The pants were shorter. The leg width was wider than you would expect for pants that short. And the jackets were a little short as well. But I'm not talking about the jackets here. I actually kind of really like the black fleece jackets. I had of course that crazy navy octagon pattern one. I wouldn't necessarily wear it now, but I wouldn't say that I regretted buying it. And I also had a big tartan plaid one that I got a lot of use out of. The thing I regret buying however were the matching pants to the tartan plaid jacket. I never wore them. The plaid was just too big, too bold. I thought I could pull them off in like a holiday situation or something, but I tried them on and just could not bring myself to wear them out of the house. Still have them. Size BB1 if you want them, hit me up in the comments. Okay, so although I am very fortunate to have a regular photographer that I work with, I do like photography myself and I do need to take pictures sometimes when Rob or Robin is not available. So basically it's important for me to have my own camera. Before I buy anything I do lots of research and of course Rob is a great resource for things like that. Well I was in the market for a camera around 2013, 2014. I wanted something that wasn't too expensive like around no more than a thousand dollars but that could still take really good photos. I was looking for something that I didn't have to buy a lens for so pretty much what I wanted was a really nice point And shoot Rob and I had gone on our very first trip together as part of his folk style We spent this really whirlwind weekend in Venice, Italy as a guess of per sole His usual camera the camera that we shoot all the photos on is a Canon 1dx mark 2 Way more camera than I needed or cared to deal with But on that trip he did take an extra camera with him to shoot a little video and just play around with and it was the Fujifilm X100S. Small, powerful, good looking camera that he really liked. So that is actually the camera that I ended up buying. I absolutely hated that camera. You know, maybe it takes a certain kind of photographer to use that camera, but I could never get it to do what I wanted. I can't count the number of times that I was so disappointed in the photos that I'd taken. There were instances where I needed to get a good shot and it just failed me. And I tried to get better with it, but it just did not work for me, so it ended up being more of a prop than anything else, which was terrible. Next, this is not style-related in any way, shape, or form for the record. You may know that I used to race a bike, and bicycle racers are very particular about their equipment. At the elite level, small things like your shifters, your brake calipers, your tires, can all make a really minute, but huge difference when you're stacked up against people who are all, you know, basically at the same ability level. Wheels are one of those things that are extremely important. And since it isn't style related, I will try to keep it shorter, but there is a very scary story involved here. So I was looking at getting a pair of Zip 404s, but, you know, they're really expensive. And there was this guy kind of in the cycling community around here who started selling his own wheels. So I decided to support him instead. As soon as I got these wheels, I felt like I had made a huge mistake. They were light, which is good, but they felt really cheap to the point of not inspiring any confidence on the bike at all. So that next weekend, there was a road race and my job in that race was to attack early on, get in a breakaway, make the field chase me so my teammate could sit in and then launch a counter attack once they caught me. I did exactly that, but this was one of the most frightening breakaways that I had ever done. It was a very hilly course, there were a lot of fast downhills, and these wheels were freaking me out. They were supposedly trued, but they were wobbly, and I literally thought they were gonna fall off the bike or break in half. So, imagine what that feels like when you are going down a hill on a bike at 45, 50 miles an hour with only a thin layer of spandex between you and the pavement. I got rid of those things real fast, bit the bullet, and got some zip 404s. The moral of the story is that it's worth paying more for quality. So how cool are people like Angel Ramos, Jake Muser, Matt Hranek, Steve of the Snob Report, et cetera? I love seeing photos of these guys on Instagram. Their style is just so natural and relaxed and easy going. It's very inspiring to me, and I really like their approach. And one of the things I saw all these guys wearing quite a lot over the last year, year and a half or so was a particular pair of sunglasses. Sunglasses are tough for me. I have kind of a narrow face. So there are a lot of sunglasses that just don't work for me. Some of them that I really love like the Purcell 649 or 714 or even Ray-Ban aviators thankfully come in smaller sizes. And those are always the sizes that I wear. Now the sunglasses in question that I was seeing all these guys wear, They just look so cool. We're the Porsche Design sunglasses by Carrera. So I started looking into them and was kind of disappointed to find out that typically these are very wide, which definitely meant that they would be way too large for my face and look completely ridiculous. But the more reading I did, I did find that there were smaller sizes available, particularly in vintage models. So I hopped on eBay, searched for vintage versions and specifically ones that were designated as small. I found a few pairs and the pair that I liked the most wasn't that expensive, it was like 100 bucks. So I decided to roll the dice. You wanna see what these things look like? Yeah, not really for me. The takeaway is that we all make mistakes and it doesn't even really matter how much knowledge you have about a certain thing. You know, I talk a lot about suits and tailored clothing on the channel, But that doesn't mean that I haven't made my fair share of mistakes when it comes to my own suits. I can't make decisions for you, but hopefully sharing mistakes that I've made and talking about why I decided to do those things can help you if you find yourself in a similar situation. And that's exactly what I talk about in that video right over there. So click there to find out what I view as my worst custom suit mistakes."

        "transcript": " Oh man, this is going to be a good one today. So although it's only been like two years since we've really focused on YouTube and put a lot of effort into it, we have been making videos on the channel off and on from the very beginning, so all the way back to 2013. And I thought it'd be fun to go back and kind of take a look at the very first video we ever made and to view it from today's lens. Interestingly, the first video on the channel was not what you would consider like a typical YouTube video compared to what we're doing now and how we do videos now. It was actually a part of a project that a friend of mine was doing. He's a video guy and in 2013 he challenged himself to make one video every month. He knew about He Spoke Style. He thought there was a story to tell there so he asked me if I'd be open to doing kind of like a little short film with him. We shot this in one day, multiple locations. It was a very long day. It was very fun to do. And the idea of it was just to basically tell the story of what he spoke style was and why I decided to start it. So it's been a very long time since I've watched this video and what I'm interested in is to hear what I had to say back then and then to see how well and if at all it still tracks with what I'd say today, what my vision for he spoke style is today versus what I was saying then. I'd really just kind of wondering how embarrassing this is going to feel. not too embarrassing, but we shall see. So I've got the video queued up here and I think we should just dive right into it now. So without further ado, let's take a look at He Spoke Style, the video. Yeah. Style, good style is timeless. Style is transcendent. So one thing I want to point out actually before we go any further is that the soundtrack to this was actually done by another really talented friend of mine. So total collaboration from the video to the music here. My name is Brian Sakao and I'm founder and creative director of He Spoke Style. One of the things that really speaks to me about doing the website is that I'm a professional musician and music is all about communication and the website... Gotta stop here. So the suit I'm wearing is a Brooks Brothers suit. Don't have that suit anymore. The shirt is by Banana Republic. Don't have that anymore. There's my watch, the Timex for J Crew, circa 2010 that I wore all the time. And then I have to point out one of my big mistakes here, here, which is wearing these cuff links. They're by Paul Smith and they've got a skull on them. I thought it was cool, but looking at it now, it's like trying just a little too hard with that. To me, is a form of communication. And style, in fact, is a form of communication. Deciding what you're going to wear. Still got that bag, too. Or what you're not going to wear says something about you. And whether you are into fashion or style or not, or don't claim to be, what you wear or what you choose not to wear says a lot about you. It says how you want to be perceived by people and what group you belong to or want to belong to. That sounds so familiar. It's like I could say that today. So I'm feeling pretty good about this. This scene here, we shot in like a local wine shop and just so you know, like this was not how Rob and I would typically work but it worked for the video so. Rob doesn't even drink. Everyone has their their style. He put this photo up here because he knew it was one that I really hated. Influences and style icons and a lot of people point to Kerry Grant as a big influence and I'm definitely no different. What I love about Kerry Grant style is he never looked bad in a suit and and it was because his suits fit so well. The other part of that too, he was a nice guy. He was humble in addition to being very, very stylish and that's really important to me. I think we really had a good groove for this one. Yeah, you do. Good location, good lighting. Not up, not up. Oh my God, I think I included this look in one of my least favorite looks ever. I like this one where you look like a drunk. I do look like a drunk. Having style is all about having confidence. If you wear something with confidence, it will look good. If you're uncomfortable wearing something, it won't look good. Confidence goes hand in hand with style. I wasn't really waving at anyone there. If you're inspired by something you see on the website, that's great. And I feel great about that because that's what the website's all about. looks better in slow motion. Firing people. If people don't find any inspiration on it, that's fine too. He spoke style is just one voice in the conversation. I started He spoke style after wearing the same outfit for an entire year. Oh man, those Alan Edmond strands look really nice back then. It was a bit of an extreme experiment, but it taught me a lot about versatility. So after the year of wearing one thing, I thought, well, what are the essential things things that a guy needs to have in his wardrobe. And that project turned into he spoke style. Hmm. Thing I really love about style is that it's extremely personal. There's no one style that's correct or right. Style is really something that a person makes their own. I'm just remembering looking at this right now. We shot this in like, I don't know, like Jared did or, he got this pizza shop as his place that we're shooting interview and it was very hot that day and I can see that I'm like really sweaty and you can also hear a lot of the background noise but hey you work with what you got right. And sure we all have our influences who we draw inspiration from but at the end of the day you know your style is what you make of it. Yes! So that was interesting to rewatch. I think what's interesting to me most is that, and what I feel most, what's the right word I'm looking for here, what makes me feel good about seeing that now is that everything I say in that video is like pretty much exactly what I say now, like why I started it, what I hope to achieve with it, what it meant to me. I think done over the years, you know, this was like, I think we filmed this in like maybe May of 2013. So I had just started in February. So I really, you know, now, nowadays, it's very much easier for me to kind of say what it's all about because, and I say it in pretty much every video and we refined it over the years. Looking back on it, I really had a very clear idea and sense of what it was that I was after, and it makes me feel good that what I was saying at least really holds up to what we do today. Really interested to hear what you guys think about this video. And hey, you know, four people that gave it a thumbs down, I mean, what's the deal? Why you got to do that? How mad you got to be to dislike a video on YouTube? But anyway, this was kind of fun to do. I'm really curious to hear your guys' reactions. If you are new to the channel and have just saw this for the first time, let me know what you think. But I just thought it would be fun to kind of go back and look at the very first video, see where we've come from, see how it stacks up to today. And then, yeah, it was cool. So thanks for watching, everyone."

        "transcript": " You want to do more with less, be ready for any situation, and get the most value out of your purchases. But there are so many options out there, especially when it comes to dress shirts, that it can be hard to narrow down what those basic pieces are that you really have to have. I always focus on versatility, and in this video I'm going to show you the only five dress shirts you will ever need. I'm Brian Sakao and you're watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Now if you've been paying attention over the last couple years on the channel, you've probably noticed that I wear pretty much the same five shirts all the time. Every once in a while I might throw in a different one like this gingham shirt for example, but in general, I'm not really stepping outside those core five shirts that I have in my wardrobe. The reason is because above all else, and one of the things I believe in most is building a wardrobe that is focused on versatility. You want pieces that you can plug in easily to a variety of different situations. Now, of course, there are two big details you need to pay attention to when you're thinking about your dress shirts. What type of collar are you going to have? And what type of cuff are you going to have? A lot of this boils down to personal preference and my personal preference is to choose a classic collar and a one button rounded cuff. These aren't the most unique styling details. In fact, you might even say they're kind of boring, but if we're talking about really leaning into getting the most out of these shirts, a classic collar and a one button rounded cuff is a really safe bet. I mean full disclosure, I like a French cuff shirt. I like a turn back cuff as well, but those have a very specific look and feel like you're not going to be able to style a French cuff shirt in a more casual setting. A one button rounded cuff however slides more easily between dressy business casual and casual scenarios. Same thing with a button down collar or a more aggressive spread collar shirt. Those have their place but again if you're looking for maximum versatility and you only wanted to have five shirts that the styling I suggest is a good way to go. Now the way we're able to get a little more out of these shirts is by considering the fabric and as I go through each of these five shirts. I'm going to talk specifically about the fabric choices and I think you'll really see how far that will go to adversitility and range to the collection. Essential shirt number one is a white shirt in a poplin fabric by Thomas Mason. 100% cotton with a weight of 150 grams. Poplin weaves because of their construction are an ideal choice for shirts that are thin and cool and that will also maintain a sturdy appearance. Poplin also has a great natural luster which which makes it perfect for more formal or suited looks, but it can also lend a bit of elegance to an outfit with chinos, for example, or even when paired with jeans. For this outfit though, I wanted to highlight the poplin shirt in a classic dressy and suited way. This is a dark navy suit that has a subtle herringbone pattern in it, brown pattern tie to kind of take the formality down just a little bit, simple white pocket square, and brown Oxford shoes. I spent so much time talking about the collar style I recommend, So I want to point out why I do really like this style. The main reason is that I love how the collar interfaces with the lapel of the jacket. Because of the length of the collar, you don't see the point which I think just looks very clean and very polished. Essential shirt number two is one of my favorites, an ice blue Oxford cloth shirt. This fabric is by Thomas Mason, 100% cotton and a weight of 180 grams. You always hear about the OCBD or Oxford cloth button down. Certainly a staple, more casual style shirt, but with a classic collar like this, you get the added versatility of being able to style it in a more dressed up way. Which is what I'm doing here, pairing it with a brown shark skin suit, which seems to have become one of the fan favorites in the shop. I chose a Prince of Wales check or a Glen plaid tie here to keep it more in that in-between, not super formal, dressed up styling where I feel like an Oxford shirt like this really shines and then again to keep things on the more relaxed side of dressed up I'm anchoring this look with a pair of tassel overs. Essential shirt number three is also an Oxford cloth shirt but this one with a stripe. Fabric is by Thomas Mason again it's 100% cotton with a weight of 150 grams. A stripe shirt is a must have and I particularly like the size of this stripe. It's not too thin, it's not too wide but it's different enough while still being classic and therefore very easy to style. I always think of a striped shirt like this as kind of fresh and lending itself to a more relaxed approach, which is why I've paired it here with a hopsack suit. Hopsack, as you know, great choice for a suit with a more casual feel, ditto on the patch pockets. I chose a medallion tie with a lighter tannish color, again, playing into that relaxed and not super buttoned up and formal vibe. Sunglasses are by Oliver Peoples and the Derby Shoes are by Enzo Bonafé. Shirt number four is gray with what you might call a reversed pencil stripe. It's in a poplin fabric by Cancleanee, 100% cotton and light weight at 110 grams. This is going to be your dark horse kind of underdog shirt in the collection, but one that gives you just an incredible amount of range and really deepens your entire collection. This shirt for me kind of feels like low key elegance and I've paired it with the same dark blue suit with a subtle herringbone pattern that you saw in the first look. Totally on purpose because although the looks are similar, what you can see here is that the richness of the gray with the addition of the stripe, although still more or less on the formal side, just has a completely different feel. And for a shirt to be able to transform a suit like that, that's what we're looking for when we talk about versatility. Essential shirt number five is a denim shirt. The fabric is by Cancleanee 100% cotton 210 grams. This is such a great sportier shirt to have and one of my favorite things about it is how easily it can dress down a suit or more business casual looks. And business casual is what I'm doing here. I've paired the denim shirt with our brown Donagletweet sport coat, pair of navy cotton trousers, classic pocket square and some derby shoes which are again by Enzo Bonafé. Now I want to let you know that all of these shirts are available in the HSS shop. And the best part about that is if you, you know, want something different, like a different collar style or a different cuff style, you can completely customize those parts of the shirt and add to that that you're going to be going through our measuring process. So you can be really confident that you're going to get a shirt that is fit perfectly for you. If you haven't checked out our shirts in the shop yet, there's a link right over there. So click there, head over to the shop, and start filling your wardrobe with some great menswear essentials."

        "transcript": " I'm going to alternate here between looks that are outdoor and ones that are just for inside. First look I'm starting off with an ice blue button up paired with some light wash jeans and then I'm going to layer in a tan crew neck sweater which is by Everlane. I'm going with these hiking boots here. They're by Danner. Really classic with red laces for the coat. I'm doing just a classic Pico and then I'm throwing on these braided leather gloves by Hiltz Willard. I've been really into 1970s Robert Redfern style recently and this look is 100% influenced by his style in three days of the Condor. From the Pico to the layered sweater all the way down to the hiking boots but I think his were a little darker and didn't have red laces but whatever. So this is just a super easy look to throw together. basics, they're comfortable and great for winter. This next look is my favorite Canadian Tuxedo Polo Ralph Lauren Western shirt and double RL jeans. I'm going to pair this with my Black Watch plaid Belgian shoes which I love wearing around the house and then throwing on this tan zip-up cashmere cardigan by Gobi Cashmere. I find even if I'm just sitting around and working at home, I do like to put just a little effort into what I'm wearing. I feel like it just puts me in a different mindset than if I was just sitting around in like sweatpants and hoodie. Nothing wrong with that by the way. But even just something this simple and of course a little elevated via the cashmere motivates me to get things done. I'm starting off again with some faded jeans and a great super comfortable and warm cream colored cable knit sweater. And I'm going to pair this with some white leather sneakers to keep it kind of casual and sporty. Over that I'm going to layer on a barber quilted vest and then some shearling gloves and finishing it off with a tin wool knit cap by Drake's. I really like how sporty this look is and there's some great contrast with both the blues and the browns. The sweater is actually by Sunspell and it's so thick and warm I find it's a great sweater to pair with just a quilted vest like this. The gloves I absolutely love. It's another pair by Hiltz Willard. Not only are they warm but I think they add a really nice bit of understated color and contrast with the rest of this very simple look. Here I've got black jeans and a burgundy striped cashmere turtleneck by Gobi and since this is an at-home look I'm going to slip on my black suede Belgian shoes. Such great shoes for wearing around the house and then to add in a layer because it is a little chilly down in the studio I'm throwing on this wool overshirt or shacket, which I've had forever and is actually by H&M made with cloth by Abraham Moon. I love wearing jackets and sport coats, but you know at home it might feel like a little much so a Shacket like this is a great alternative. I like how the stripe of the sweater pulls in the color of the shacket It's not an exact match, but that's almost better and fun fact as I record this voiceover This is the outfit I am wearing today as well. Featuring the Shackett again this time with some dark denim and since I'm going to be walking the dog and it's been a little muddy, I'm going with these LL Bean gum shoes. Then I'm going to use a scarf here. It's by Barber and their classic plaid. Throwing on my Barber jacket. This is the Ashby model if you're wondering. Then the same Drake's hat you've already seen and the Shearling Hilt's Willard gloves. Something I've been doing a lot recently that you see here is when I layer in a jacket like this, I like to pop the collar along with the jacket collar because I like how it sticks out, creates a layering effect, and is a way to give even a super casual look like this a little bit of a stylish twist. Here I've got light wash jeans and a brown brush cotton shirt, which I'm going to pair again with the Black Watch plaid Belgian shoes. I want to add another layer for some warmth here. So I'm throwing on a thin merino wool quarter zip sweater, which is by Sunspell. Pretty simple and no nonsense. Look here. Again, I feel like actually taking the time to do even just simple layering like this and putting on an actual button-up shirt can do a lot for staying positive and being productive. And I mean, it doesn't take a lot. This is just so simple, but it's something I found that really works for me. Going with black jeans once again, this time with with a Buffalo plaid shirt by Uniqlo. And also again, the black suede Belgian shoes for my extra layer here. I'm throwing on this great chunky shawl color cardigan, which is by Tommy Hilfiger. Another piece I've had for quite a long time. I will do my best to find something similar to link to in the description. If you're looking for some more winter outfit inspiration, I've put together a playlist for you that has some more casual outfit ideas, some winter trends that I think are actually worth following, some business casual outfit ideas, and a complete winter capsule wardrobe.

        "transcript": " There are so many style rules out there, it can be really confusing to try and figure out which ones you should be following. And I know that the last thing you want to do is to do something wrong. But the thing with style rules is that many of them can be broken. And in this video I'm going over seven outdated men's style rules you can completely ignore as well as one that you should always follow. I'm Brian Sakao and you're watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. The first outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is honestly so outdated you may not even ever have heard of it. It's one that personally makes no sense to me and that is no brown in town. So back in the day when men went to work in the city, they either wore blue, gray, or black. Brown was the color that you wore when you were at home or out in the country. Obviously, obviously, as you know, I think brown is a perfectly acceptable color for a suit and can work in a professional setting. It's a really great alternative to navy in that it's very easy to pair with a variety of different colors. So no brown in town, that's a rule you can break. The second outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is one that I know so many people get seriously hung up on and that is that your shoes need to match your belt. In theory, this is a good rule to follow because having your shoes and belt match creates a lot of harmony and it looks pleasing to the eye. In reality though, this is a rule that is almost impossible to follow. I mean think of all the shoes you have. all the different shades of brown, black, oxblood, finding a belt to match each one exactly, not only near impossible, but also very expensive. And you know, should you have a white belt for your white sneakers? In general, you just kind of want to get in the ballpark. My recommendation is to have a black belt for your black shoes and a medium brown belt for everything else. If you'd like to throw in something like a fabric D ring belt for casual looks, that's another good option as well. But always matching your belt to your shoes, that's a rule you can break. The third outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is one that I get questions about all the time in the comments here. And that is the rule that says you don't mix navy and black. Now, I don't know where this rule came from, but it happens to be out there. You know, if you're wearing a dark suit for a dressier occasion, a pair of black shoes with a dark navy suit is completely fine. It matches the level of formality. And you know, what if you're wearing a midnight blue tux? Are you not supposed to wear black shoes with that? You are and it's what looks right. And pairing black with navy within an outfit is also totally acceptable. You know, the only instance I can think of where black and navy doesn't really work is wearing black dress shoes with dark blue jeans. That just looks wrong. So not mixing navy and black, that's a rule you can break. The fourth outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is similar to the last one in that it deals with pairing two colors together and that is don't mix brown and black. Again, I'm not sure where that came from, but it's another rule that I personally do not endorse. I really like the contrast of browns and blacks together, but you have to be careful about the color of brown that you are pairing with black. It can't be too dark because you want to bring out that contrast. So let's take a pair of black jeans, for example. Put on a pair of chestnut Chelsea boots, that looks good. Throw on a tan sweater, that looks good too. Finish it off with a light brown trucker jacket. Also looks good. So don't mix brown and black. That's a rule you can break. The fifth outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is another one of those that can kind of tie you in knots. And that is don't mix metals. Now the thinking behind this rule is similar to the shoes matching your belt rule, which is that it just looks better and more harmonious and more uniform if all your metals are the same. You know, but what if I wanna wear a steel watch? Should I have an extra steel wedding band instead of a gold one? Does having a gold wedding band mean I can't wear a steel watch? And what about two-tone watches? I mean, I understand that like Cilantro or Licorice, this is generally something people love or hate, but there's really nothing wrong with it. The only time I really ever think about adhering to this rule is when I'm wearing black tie, but day to day, it doesn't really matter. So don't mix your metals, that's a rule you can break. The sixth outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is kind of like the sartorial equivalent of typecasting and that is that double-breasted suits are for slim men only. The reason this myth exists is because of the way a double-breasted jacket creates width. Now there is more fabric but the main thing is the horizontal lines that are produced. The lapels rather than going straight down go across the body. Also the peaks point out so that creates width and the buttons create a horizontal line. These things can be managed in a couple ways. You could have the buttons closer together. You could also have the lapels slope farther down. So as far as double-breasted suits being for slim men only, that's a rule you can break. The seventh outdated men's style rule you do not have to follow is, I will admit, a little on the advanced side. However, if you're at that point or you're just getting there, this is one that you'll want to pay attention to. The rule is to always button an entire double-breasted jacket. And we're actually talking about two different scenarios here. So the first scenario has to deal with having all of the buttons done on the jacket. It's a more formal jacket, and that's the way it should look, so people say. But tailoring does not have to be formal, even a double-breasted jacket. Unbuttoning the bottom button is one way you can give a double-breasted jacket a more casual feel. And another way is to leave the inside button undone which doesn't force the lapel to be super straight. The second scenario we're talking about is again a bit of a cilantro licorice scenario and that's leaving the entire jacket unbuttoned. The reason people say not to do this is because of all the extra fabric that would be flapping around. However if you engage in some menswear mannerisms and put your hands in your pockets, I know not for everyone, it could look okay. But always buttoning an entire double breasted jacket, that's a rule you can break. There is one rule, however, that I suggest you always follow. It's one that I use to guide pretty much every single style related decision I make. There's no formula. It's not written in a book anywhere that I know of, but it's something I truly believe in. And that rule is, if it looks right, it is right. Intuition is a big part of developing your style. It's also what this channel is all about. So if you're at that point where you're ready to commit to that process and make your style your own, click on that playlist right over there, which I put together to help you get there faster."

        "transcript": " Five things I love about Géger Le Cool watches. Numbers one, two, and three, all focused on design. They're timeless, they're elegant, and the design is always perfectly balanced. Number four, they're technically masterful, and number five, they tend to fly under the radar. I've got two of my favorites from the new Master Control Collection here today, and we're gonna check them out and see what there is to love right after this. [\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"] I'm Brian Sakao, and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. The Reverso is obviously JLC's most recognizable watch, and its popularity kind of overshadows a lot of the other models in the brand's portfolio, one of those being the Master Control Collection, which has been around since 1992. In my opinion, the Master Control Collection is an overlooked gem that once you discover it and really get to know it, really shows you how diverse and versatile JLC is as a brand. Because despite the Reverso's beginnings as a sport watch designed for polo players, it really has evolved into and become this epitome of elegance, refinement, and sophistication, which often manifests itself as a very formal watch and therefore JLC, a very formal brand. But the Master Control Collection, along with the recently reimagined Polaris, really speaks to the depth of offerings from JLC and shows you that one of their biggest strengths is making hardworking, classic, versatile, and beautiful round watches. I was able to get my hands on two of my favorites from the collection, not my personal watches, unfortunately. And we're gonna take a look at them in detail right now. First up, we have the Master Control Calendar in Rose Gold. This is reference Q4142520 powered by caliber 866. Also available in stainless steel. It's a 40 millimeter case with a thickness of 10.95 millimeters, which means it's a great kind of contemporary sized watch. The dial is silver with a nice sunray finish. We've got applied indexes with loom plots on both the dial and in insets on the hour and minute hands. If anyone's wondering, it's got a water resistance of 50 meters though. Don't think anyone would be taking this in the water. Let's take a closer look at the dial, which I think is just absolutely gorgeous and perfectly balanced. Already pointed out the beautiful hour and minute hands at six o'clock is a sub-second style with a running seconds hand, which also houses the beautiful moon phase complication. This is a calendar watch, so we have apertures below the JLC signature for the day of the week on the left and the month on the right. Date laid out in a ring around the dial and indicated by this red tipped hand here. Everything is set with pushers on either side of the case and I must say that one of the coolest and most understated features you never knew you wanted is the fact that this date hand jumps over the moon phase from 15 to 16, so it never obscures that dial. And that's kind of the attention to detail that really sets JLC apart in my opinion. This is an automatic movement with a power reserve of 70 hours, chronometer certified, 1000 hour master control certification. On the wrist, this watch is just perfect. It feels great. It looks amazing, kind of unassuming, with a low key elegance that is perfect for daily wear. Price in rose gold, $24,900. And then in steel, you're looking at a price tag of $11,000. Next, we're going to look at a watch that I was honestly prepared to not like at all, but as is often the case, the opinion you might have just by looking at a photo can completely change when you actually see the watch in person. And here it is, the Gégeur Le Coulte Master Control calendar chronograph in steel. This is reference Q4138420, powered by the JLC caliber 759. This watch is also available in rose gold, though I must say I do really like it in steel. It's got a 40 millimeter case diameter with a thickness of just over 12 millimeters, 50 meters of water resistance and a power reserve of 65 hours. The most beautiful thing about this watch, obviously, is the dial soap. Let's take a closer look at that. What is most striking to me about this dial is that despite the number of things going on and complications that it has is that it just looks so balanced and harmonious. Silver sunray finish, pulsation scale around the dial, it's got applied indexes, loom inset on the hour and minute hands, and then also around the dial at 3, 6, 9, and 12. Got a blue chronograph hand, pushers are at 2 and 4. At 9 o'clock, a small running second style. Three o'clock, we've got the chronograph minutes register at 12 under the JLC signature. have the day aperture on the left and the month on the right. And then at six o'clock we have the date indicator which encircles the moon phase. On the wrist this watch wears really really well. It's got a little bit of heft which feels quite nice and again I just love that this is such a beautiful and elegantly designed watch that calls absolutely no attention to itself. Price in steel as shown here, $15,200. And then in Le Grand Rose Gold, you're looking at a price tag of $28,500. If you love watches and want to watch more watch videos, I've put together a playlist right over there featuring some great pieces. Some are from my own personal collection with the stories of how and why I came by them. And some are pieces that I've had the great opportunity to experience over the years and would consider adding to my collection. So click right there and check those out."

        "transcript": " Have you struggled to find those pieces that strike the perfect balance between looking put together without going overboard? Like you want to look nice but you don't want to overdo it. Maybe you're not a suit guy, a suit and tie could be too formal for where you work and definitely too dressed up for let's say a simple date. Well I've put together a 15 piece capsule wardrobe along with 10 different outfit ideas to show you exactly how to do it. I'm Brian Sacawa, you're watching He Spoke Style where we give you the information and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. So what we're talking about here and what this capsule wardrobe is built around is a business casual dress code. Now you've probably heard terms like smart casual, sharp casual. For me, while there might be subtle distinctions between those and business casual, I'm not one to really get caught up in strict definitions. I think in any case, whether you're talking business casual, smart casual, or sharp casual, the bottom line is that the dress code means looking put together without appearing too formal. It's that simple. And the 15 pieces I'm about to show you could fit in any of those three dress code categories. So although you'll sometimes hear business casual equals no suit, I am including a suit here. A suit does not necessarily have to be formal, and that is especially true when the suit is in a hopsack fabric, a hopsack suit. If you've been around the channel for a while now, you know is extremely versatile. And because of the weave and texture of the fabric, it comes off as a more casual suit option and gives you a great standalone jacket as well. Also contributing to the casual feel, I recommend a jacket with patch pockets. Next, we're gonna add in another jacket, a light gray sport coat. And I chose a second jacket in a solid color instead of a pattern because I wanted this wardrobe to be as versatile as possible and as simple as possible to style, especially for someone who might just be starting out in their style journey and maybe a little uncomfortable with a bolder plaid or check pattern. On to shirts now. We have an ice blue Oxford cloth shirt, a striped shirt and a denim shirt, which is in my opinion one of the best shirts for this kind of capsule wardrobe. A few pairs of pants now we've got navy chinos, khaki chinos and then throwing into the mix a pair of dark denim jeans. Layering pieces, we've got a navy v-neck sweater and a tan crew neck sweater. I'm going with two ties here, a medallion print silk tie and a striped granadine tie. And then finally footwear, a pair of suede Oxford lace-ups, tassel loafers, and a pair of cap toe boots. Those are my 15 must-have pieces for a business casual capsule wardrobe. Now let's take a look at 10 different outfit ideas. First look Look here, very simple, very classic and laid back, great jacket, navy cotton trousers, and denim shirt really showing the way that it is able to temper the formality of a jacket and pants outfit. And for this look, I decided to finish it off with these suede oxfords. With a second look, I'm really taking what I would call a very classic business casual approach. We've got the navy v-neck sweater over the striped oxford shirt paired with the khaki cotton trousers and finished off with these suede oxfords once again. Super easy outfit that is not fussy at all. Third look, dressing it up a bit more by adding in the tie. I do think that there is a place for ties in business casual but they should be less formal in nature either via a texture or a pattern like we've got here and then the pattern mixing between the shirt and tie also making it less formal. Another very classic super easy kind of what I would call textbook business casual look here. Current X sweater over the Ice Blue Oxford cloth shirt paired with some navy cotton trousers. I think this look just really shows you how simple business casual can be. You don't have to over think it. Three solid basics and a pair of suede lace-ups and you're done. Here we've got more or less a classic menswear uniform, navy jacket, Ice Blue Oxford cloth shirt, khaki cotton trousers, such an easy look. You know, you could add a tie. I think medallion tie would look really good with this too, but I wanted to keep it on the more casual side so I went without. And then the loafers are a nice casual touch as well to finish it off. I know that this one is dressed up and maybe on the line of fitting within business casual, but there are enough casual kind of elements that I'm gonna point out to try and justify this. It's a hopsack suit with the texture and patch pockets contributing to that casual feel. Grenadine tie, again, a textural element, and then the tassel loafers taking some formality out of the suit too. This is a more casual approach, obviously, with the addition of the dark denim, but there really is that range that you'll find within business casual. Dressing it up with some simple layering of the tan crew neck sweater over the striped shirt, and then the boots also kind of elevating the denim, giving it more polish. Sport coat with dark denim, definitely acceptable for business casual in my book, but you gotta make sure that your sport coat fabric pairs well with the denim. Hop sack works and flannel like we have here, also a great option. I like the denim shirt because of the way it bridges the gap between the casual and dressy elements and then the boots kind of dressing up the jeans just a bit more. Another look with jeans here with a very laid back and casual approach. One of the things that I think makes this look work as a business casual outfit even with the jeans is that the two big blue elements we have here are very dark and it's monochromatic which gives it just a little more quote unquote seriousness. And this one I went with suede shoes instead of the boots. This look has a little bit more of a lighter and brighter feel. It's not easy I would say to kind of match lighter tans like this and it might not be for everyone, but I like it here. I think there's enough contrast between the crew neck and the khaki cotton pants to make it work. All basic pieces, all incredibly versatile."

        "transcript": " I mean, can you even remember what it was like before March of last year? I've been thinking a lot about what my routine was. I'd get up around six or so, walk the dog, make some coffee, take a shower, go to work, hit the gym for an hour, hour and a half, come home, have dinner, hang out a little bit with Robin, maybe watch some TV or a movie, go to sleep and do it all again the next day. Then all of a sudden, that completely changed. No more driving into work, no more going to the gym, feeling confused and scared and helpless, worrying about everything I touch when I had to get stuff from the grocery store or if the virus might be on a package that was just delivered. It was crazy and I'm sure many of you had the exact same feelings as me. Now if there are two things I really know about myself, it's that one, I perform best when I am locked into a routine and two, when that routine gets upset, bad things happen and five terrible things started to happen to me and I found myself falling into some really bad and unwanted habits. You're going to find out what those were and more importantly how I got myself back on track but the general idea was tied to two things, putting the effort into taking care of myself and committing to a routine. That's why I'm really proud to partner with our sponsor for today's video, Ritual. Ritual is a high quality, scientifically developed, traceable, I'll get to what that means in a second, multivitamin that is designed to help fill nutrient gaps in men's diets. As a former elite level athlete and still very active person, I know firsthand just how important it is to give your body what it needs so you're able to perform to your best and just stay healthy in general because you're not able to get that full picture even if you do eat a very healthy diet. Now heart health, brain health, normal muscle and immune function, these are all very important and they're specifically what the ritual essential for men, 18 plus multivitamin helps support with nutrients like vitamin K2, omega 3 DHA, vitamins A and D3 as well as magnesium and zinc. It's vegan friendly, non-GMO, gluten and allergen free, no fillers or colors or additives. And I mentioned before that this is traceable. So what that means is that you can actually go to the website, see where in the world each nutrient comes from, read more about the supplier, and find links to studies on each particular nutrient. If you subscribe to Ritual, they deliver right to your door once a month. It's free shipping. And if you're not completely satisfied within the first month, they'll refund your order. If you're interested in trying it out, I have a link down below in the description as well as a code he spoke style for you to save 10% off your first three months. So the biggest thing that happened to all of us was that we were forced into a situation that wasn't planned and that was completely beyond our control. For me, that kind of crazy 180 degree change is just something that I've always had trouble adapting to immediately. And this was just different on a whole other level. I'm not a huge extrovert, but I do enjoy being around people. So the fact that I couldn't see family, I couldn't see friends, there were no hugs, there were no handshakes, led me to start seeking comfort in something that I associate with being together with people and enjoying that time together. And that was eating. Robin, I know, felt the same way. So we started cooking really rich comfort meals almost daily. My personal favorite was Peter Clemenza's Godfather Spaghetti. Tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it, you make sure it doesn't stick. You gotta throw a boil, you're shoving all your sausage and your meatballs. As a way to cope with the fact that there was this kind of social void in our lives now, it's okay to have a meal like that once in a while, but every day, kind of a bad thing. And then there was the sense of dread and uncertainty and just plain scaringness of everything. And then like being just cooped up, can't go anywhere, and along with that, the loss of structure to the day. So, you know, what else is there to do? Well, why not have a drink? I mean, I don't have to go to work. It's three o'clock in the afternoon. All right, I'll have an agronie, or two, or three. And having too many drinks just became a bad pattern, not out of any kind of dependence, but mostly just out of boredom. And as I was feeling so bored, along with all the uncertainty and fear, I just kind of got to the point where I was feeling like there really wasn't anything to look forward to. One of the things I did look forward to on a daily basis, before the pandemic was going to the gym. And I remember the day that I was on my way into the gym and as I got to the door, they were just closing up because of a statewide mandate. I don't like working out at home. I need to be in a different space. I'd like to have all the equipment at my disposal. So I just kind of stopped exercising for a pretty long stretch. So add to that eating and drinking more than you should. And you can kind of see where this is going. Where it was going was that I felt like I had a complete lack of control over everything. And in that mental space, instead of trying to take control, I just kind of let it spin more out of control. And that kind of crept into areas of the house, like the studio and my closet, where I just didn't take the time to create order, which is another way of saying that a whole bunch of messes pile up. And that just kind of added to that sense of feeling out of control. I was unmotivated. We weren't making videos. I wasn't really producing anything at all, which led me in general to not take very good care of myself. So eating poorly, drinking too much, not exercising, lending messes pile up, and just generally not taking care of myself. These are the five bad habits that I fell into. But how did I turn it around? Well, the thing that happened was that I just got sick of it all. The way I was living was not me. I'm a healthy eater, I drink in moderation, I love to push myself with exercise, I like to have a neat living and working space, and I was just hating how I felt, hating how I looked, and hating having all of my clothing feel a whole lot smaller. But remember, this all comes back to me feeling like I didn't have control and that I didn't have a routine. So knowing those things, I decided to finally commit to making a better and healthier routine for myself. Was it easy? Absolutely not. The thing about bad habits is that they're very easy to fall into, but they're really hard to break. It takes effort, and it's much easier to do nothing than it is to do something. So I took control. I got back to basics with eating right. I completely cut out alcohol. I got down with the resistance band and body weight exercises. My rowing machine finally came in, which was awesome. I neaten up all of my spaces and committed to keeping them that way. And I wish I could tell you that it was like instant gratification, and I immediately felt better, but that is definitely not the case. It's hard to make a switch like that. It takes time, especially in the case of exercise and changing your body. Uh, but what happens is once you start to see those results from hard work and commitment come in, it kind of becomes addictive. You want to keep moving forward. You want to keep improving. And once you get to that state, that's when you know you've gotten into a good routine. If you find yourself in a similar situation, what I want you to know is that you have the power and ability to take control. If I can do it, you can do it. And one thing that I believe is that investing time into improving your style has a very positive effect on how you feel about yourself. And that video right over there gives you 10 instant and easy style upgrades that you can make right now. So click right there if you're ready to make that change."

        "transcript": " If you've ever wondered what makes people like Kerry Grant, Fred Astaire, and Gregory Peck just to name a few, so iconically stylish, you know, aside from things like talent, charm, wit, and dashing good looks, there's also the fact that they dress simply and timelessly. One of the staples of all their wardrobe was a classic seasonal suit, a gray flannel suit, and in this video, I'm gonna show you five ways that you can style it. [\"Style of the Year\"] I'm Brian Sakao, and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we've got all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well. Have more confidence and unlock your potential. Before jumping into the outfits, I'm going to start off with a fragrance pick to pair with all of them. I'm choosing the aptly named Grey Flannel by Jeffrey Bean. It's clean, light, and fresh with slight mossy and woody notes, perfect for winter. An inoffensive yet distinctive classic everyday scent at a great price, link down below. Starting off with a pretty classic styling here, suit with a striped shirt, navy knit tie, and brown suede Oxford shoes. You know, in the movie, the man in the gray flannel suit, the suit itself is kind of a metaphor for conformity. A gray suit was a uniform for guys of the time and self-expression wasn't a part of wearing a suit. It was just something you did. Doesn't quite have the same baggage today and it's definitely more acceptable to add some more individual and even casual touches. And I think a flannel suit especially is great for the latter. Here I'm doing that with a turn back cuff on the shirt and the knit tie with the squared off blades for a more effortless, kind of low-key, dressed up styling. As I mentioned, I think a flannel suit is a great vehicle for dressing up in a dressed down way. In other words, if you like the idea of wearing a suit but don't necessarily want the formality of a suit, flannel is the way to go. It feels and looks more relaxed and opens up more laid-back styling options like you see here. Want to talk mostly about the tie. It's by Seaward and Stern, a great winterweight wool and a beautiful deep sort of rust color. It's got a bit of texture to it, which pairs well with the flannel. Standout piece that doesn't call too much attention to itself, but really makes this look. Here again, showing a more kind of casual dressed up styling and playing to the softness and playfulness that you can draw out of a flannel suit. The shirt is made in a light brown brushed cotton by Luca Filoni. It's very soft, it's unique, and it really relaxes the overall vibe of the suited look. Another standout kind of funky tie here, this one by Drake. It's a nice semi-thick but very supple wool with a brown and black houndstooth pattern. Good to have one or two statement ties like this in the wardrobe. And then to keep that relaxed but dressy feel going, I finished this look off with a pair of brown suede tassel loafers. One of the best parts about a flannel suit is how easily it breaks down into separates. Not only do you get a suit, but you've also got a very versatile jacket and as you'll see, a pair of pants. If you are a sport coat and jeans kind of guy, a flannel sport coat is one that you definitely want to have for the season. It's one of those fabrics that pairs really well with the weight of denim. Underneath, just some really simple layering with a white OCBD and light gray wool V-neck sweater, and anchored with a brown leather cap toe boot by Scaroso. Now I know some of you were like, wait, he spoke style suit video? Where's the turtleneck outfit? Well, here it is though. It's not a full suited look, just styling the pants as a separate. But I went kind of full on winter mode here with a brown herringbone double-breasted coat, Glen plaid sport coat underneath, and then a winter white turtleneck. More casual here with a pair of tassel loafers. And you know, if you're looking for some more classic, maybe more conservative or universal gray suit outfit ideas, click on that video right over there. I definitely focused on some more laid back stylings here with the gray flannel suit, but in that video, I'm focusing more on what I'd consider the, I've only got one suit and it's a gray suit suit. So watch that now."

        "transcript": " Happy New Year everyone. I hope you are having a great 2021 so far I know you've been waiting for this video for quite a while But just two things I want to mention before we jump into the outfits number one I was completely Overwhelmed by the number of submissions that we got hundreds of you guys send in outfits to be featured in this video And then number two I was extremely impressed with the quality of what was submitted and just how great all the outfits were which made it really difficult to choose which ones to feature. I'm going to go through them in no particular order though I did make a list of some of my favorites so you'll want to stick around till the end of the video to see if you made it onto my top ten. Alright let's get going now with our outfits and...okay here we go. Up first this is from from a gentleman's world from Lahore, Pakistan. Far, far away, thanks for submitting it. I love this outfit. The safari jacket, belted safari jacket looks really awesome. I love the earth tones between the brown and the dark green turtleneck and the cream trousers. Really well put together. I love also the herringbone of the safari jacket. So a really nice outfit there. It's thinking. There we go. Okay, here is number two. This is Karen from at the thrift ensemble on Instagram. This is a neat take on a classic look. I like the duffel coat, and I particularly like the color of the duffel coat. Usually you see them in like a navy color, but I think this is a really nice contrast to the dressiness of the outfit to have the duffel coat on top of it like that. Nice look. Next look here, this is Eamon. Again, another great belted safari jacket and this color is really, really cool. I can't tell from the picture if it's a deep burgundy or like a chocolate color, but it's a really nice piece and the scarf is just a really nice accent. and got a little bit of extra layering underneath. So that's a cool look. Here we go. This is number four. This is VD. I believe his name is Vlad. Correct me if I'm wrong. He's VD style point on Instagram. This is such a cool look. I mean, you can never go wrong with the Flannel Prince of Wales check during the winter time, but the real awesome thing about this outfit, I mean, aside from the awesome plaid jacket is the mustard colored turtle neck, which is a really, really great, I don't know, I would even call it like a hero piece of this outfit. But I also love the addition of the white trousers, very unexpected winter choice, but one that stands out in a really great way. Look number five. I have to say that as soon as I opened this photo up, I could not help but smile. It brought me so much joy and you can really see it in his face. Really nice outfit. I love the cable knit. Cartigan, again with the camel colored coat over, really well put together. And I think we're going to be seeing kind of a trend here with the camel coat. It's always a good choice in the winter time. Nice hat also. Here we have Casper. car by the way. Again, a really simple look and two things I actually want to point out here. Well, three. Two obvious, one less obvious. Let's start with the most obvious ones. The boots, really great addition there. And then the olive coat is nice as well. I like adding in those earth tones. But the one thing I really want to point out, and if you can see here, He's got the shirt under the turtleneck, which from time to time I will do. It's not a style move that everyone can pull off, but I think it looks really good here. Here we have Osmin, our seventh look. This is a really nice outfit. I like the color of the sweater layered underneath. I think it really pops in a nice way. The coat is really cool. I wish I could zoom in and see the texture of it because I feel like it has a really nice texture as well. And I like using the scarf here, the silk scarf as an accent to everything. It brings in the color of the tie really well on the end. So that's really nice. And the thing to know about scarves, which Osman obviously knows is that they're both practical and aesthetic and using it very well here in an aesthetic setting, or in an aesthetic way, aesthetic setting. Number eight, I don't have this gentleman's name, but on Instagram he is Artismo. So really nice, simple look, the tie, creating some contrast with the green against all of the blues. And I like how the scarf brings in, kind of ties together all the navy colors that he has working in the outfit. Number nine, this is Trey. Nice cable knit sweater, perfect for winter. And then I like the kind of more casual bomber jacket that he has over that. Again, in a tan color, nice pop when you have like a darker overall outfit there. Nice. Number 10, this is Jonathan doing a really cool monochromatic thing with brown. I love brown, so obviously I love this look. One of my favorite parts about it, other than the layered puffer vest is the Snow White Turtle Neck. Such a great option. I think white, as I said already, is such an underrated winter, unexpected winter color option. Our next photo here, this is Johann. He is at Sartorial underscore finned with two ends on Instagram. When I first saw this look, I was like, oh, he's wearing a double-breasted suit. But then when I look closer, it's Like I can see that it's actually a double breasted waistcoat. So a three-piece suit here. That color flannel suit is so classic for winter. Two-inch cuff. This is like such a well put together look. And I love the coat. It looks like it's a houndstooth pattern, but such a great contrast with the solid of the shirt. And then some nice pattern mixing with the stripe of the tie. This is Stefan, our 12th picture here. I love the look monochromatic, gray boots, kind of give it a more winter look and feel with the scarf, turtle neck, you can't go wrong. And this setting is really cool. So if you're watching, Johann, let me know where this is. This is really nice. Oh, sorry, Stefan, excuse me. All right, one thing I want to mention, this is Edvard. And one thing I want to mention here is that when he sent this image in, he said that he has a lot of social media shyness. So I appreciate him sending this in. This is a great, for me, a really great execution of like casual or dressing up a cat, a more casual look. So I've got the white sneakers, khaki pants, and then the turtleneck is a great way to to kind of elevate that a a little bit. Number 14 here, we have Christian wearing some high rise mid gray flannel trousers, perfect for the season, dark turtleneck. And one thing I like about this, it's hard to tell from the picture here, but I can't tell if this is like a top coat that you have or like a more like a work shirt or something. Either way, it looks really good. And I like the juxtaposition of all the items that you have. have here. Here we have Farhad who looks like he might have been shopping for a coat here. If you were, I hope you bought that because it looks really good on you. Chukka boots are nice. Really great casual outfit. 16 here is John and got the shearling kind of more casual coat. I can't tell if it's denim or not, but the rolled jeans and then what I really want to point out with this look is the way that the suede boots complement the or bring in the color of the turtleneck that he's wearing. So this is a really great casual look and again kind of elevated by the turtleneck. Here we have this is number 17 and this is Daniel. Don't know if this is Daniel's goat or he was just visiting a goat farm but I I included this because I really like it's just, it's super casual and there's a goat. So it's like a cool photo and then the hunter boots, which I've considered for myself, but I've never pulled a trigger on them. I only have like these LL mean boots and moccasins. The boots are kind of difficult to put on though they work and the moccasins aren't really great for walking in the snow. So if you like them, let me know in the comments And I might consider picking up a pair for myself. Here we have 18, and this is Julian. Camelcoat, double-breasted, can't go wrong there. I personally like the addition of the hat as an accent on top, and then the boots. And then the best part here is the pattern sweater. I can't tell if it's a ferroile, but it looks like a very seasonal pattern, so really like that. Here we have Jamin or Hamin. I'm sorry if I'm not pronouncing your name right, but this is a really nice look. I like the lapels of the jacket, brown. It looks like it's in a nice, heavy tweed or wool. And not everyone can pull off orange, but I think you do it really well. And this outfit in particular, the tie really kind of brings everything together and makes it a little more interesting than it would if it just was like a brown tie or something like that. Here we have number 20, and this is Jake with a very classic, simple outfit. Kind of, I'm thinking of Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor. It's very, very, it's just a classic look. And I've been watching a lot of like old Redford movies and yeah, such great style. One thing I like about this that makes it different is the coat, the P-coat, usually we see them in Navy, but this isn't a nice olive green, which is a nice change. And then that earth tone, the way you brought in more earth tones with the brown of the sweater. And then again, making sure that the boots pull in that color is a really great option. I think there are chucka boots. Those are nice suede chucka boots. Here we go, number 21. This is long. Not everyone can pull off a suit like this, double breasted in a wine or burgundy color, but I think it looks awesome on you. And I love the loafers, the fit is really good, and the white turtleneck really kind of makes it seasonal in a very festive way. Okay, here we have number 22, Drake's collection. I don't know if your name is Drake you like love Drake's clothing and accessories, but either way, this is a really nice casual look. What really makes it for me is the Marl on the turtleneck. It gives it a level of depth and visual interest that I think is really great. You'll have to let us know down in the comments where that's from. And then I believe those are some Chelsea boots with nice roll. So really great elevated more casual style look here. Number 23 is Nikolas who looks like you and shopping at Brooks Brothers from the bag. I like the kind of combination of more casual and dressy here with the shearling denim jacket and the cardigan underneath, a great layering piece. And again I love of how you guys are like kind of pulling in that middle layer with the color of the shoes. A nice, you have got a really nice like more casual boot here, which I think this whole outfit is just really well put together in a really easy casual, elevated casual look that you could wear. Exactly like if you're going out shopping like you are. Here we have Number 24. Don't know this gentleman's name. He is Sartoriazza on Instagram. But one thing I really wanted to point out here is the way he's mixed a more casual jacket with, it looks like more military inspired. I don't think it's a barber jacket because of the epaulets, but more military inspired jacket with a classic suited look. I think it's something that I want to start doing a little bit more myself. I think this is really sort of untrend at the moment in a good way. I typically don't like trends, but this is a really nice look and I love the combination of the two. Here's Daniel with camel overcoat, turtleneck. And then one thing I really want to point out here that I like that kind of makes this look like a great elevated casual look is the color of the jeans. Like if you did dark denim, they would kind of blend in a little bit and dress it up a little bit more. But choosing that sort of mid color denim, I think gives it a really nice look and it really pops between the turtleneck and the coat and matches really well with the overall vibe and feel of the boots. Number 26, this is Professor Kay Kenney and this is like such a cool look that I personally cannot pull off but he does it so well. I like the, it's kind of like a chalk stripe flannel trouser but it's more casual I think because of the, looks like it has a drawstring there. And then the, this shirt has a band collar which I haven't seen band collars in quite a while, but this looks really cool. The jacket is, I can't tell if it's like a, like an over shirt or a jacket or a cardigan with patch pockets, but it looks really nice. Everything just pulls together really well and the green, the yellow of the beanie kind of really matches the tan, not matches, but complements the tan of the pants in a really great way. So I like this look a lot. Here we have Thomas or Tomas sending this look. Great camel overcoat. Again, we've got some white jeans, I believe, or maybe they're chinos or kind of a cotton pant. But great. Again, I'll say it again. A great kind of unexpected winter choice. And then the earth tones with the shirt underneath, dark green color and the kind of ox blood derby-ish boots I think, looks really well put together. This is Jean showing us how to do the classic menswear uniform with the flannel pants, navy blazer, stripe shirt with a little bit more of a candy stripe which is a nice choice I think and then the tie, really great overall look. I mean, this is pretty much a masterclass on how to do that classic menswear uniform look. Here we've got Dewan, here from Dewan all the time and I appreciate you sending in this photo. Really easy going look here with just a layered sweater. Simple, classic, very well done. Here we have Thorbjorn. I hope I said that right. With a cool, casual, multi-layered look. I think I'm counting one, the turtleneck, one, zip up cardigan, two, suit jacket, three, and then jacket. So there's four layers there. Keeping it casual with the, keeping it casual with the shoes and sneaker, or sneakers I should say. And again, like pulling that color in from the turtleneck, that, that like innermost layer and I really like the the plaid subtle plaid of the jacket which really kind of pops against this more muted color scheme. This is Enish with a classic Pico simple scarf tie, black jeans I used to call them I still I guess I still call them you know your alternative dress pant really simple classic look Well done. Don't know this gentleman's name, although I believe Instagram, he is Oceans911, that's the number nine and the word 11. Power suit here, which, you know, pinch stripe, red tie, you know, totally means business, but I like the addition of the camel, camel coat just to give it, maybe dress it down a little bit if that's even possible, but it's a nice contrast and has a nice pop to it. Number 33, we've got Martin. I love these trousers that you've got the layered denim jacket with a turtleneck underneath. That's such a good, good choice. Again, we've got a subtle plaid on the overcoat. Really pops, keeping it more casual with the sneakers and then a really nice kind of newsboy hat, which looks great here. Number 34, we have Benisa. Really simple, easy. Again, kind of elevated casual thing going on. I like the turtleneck. The coat is more of like an oatmeal, kind of grayish color, I guess. Maybe a little bit of a moral to it, which makes it really pop against the rest of the outfit. Rolled jeans with boots, can't go wrong with that. Here we have Eric sending an awesome picture with what I would call like a Hollywood gray. I can't tell if it's a flannel suit or if it's more of a fresco, but either way, it looks great. It's hard to pull off, I think sometimes that lighter colored suit, but the addition of the coat is like the color, the way like the color kind of grades between the suit to the coat is really, really nice. And then I can't really see, but there is some sort of subtle pattern on the tie, which I mean, this is just such a great, really well put together look with some interesting elements that stand out in a very subtle way, if that even makes sense. This is Yvonne or Ivan, another great casual look, white sneakers, light denim jeans, and the two things that kind of elevate this are, of course, the more chunky, cable-ish turtleneck. neck and then the moral of the coat which is really nice color combo such so classic but it looks real fresh here and the kind of olive green hat really adds something a little bit of contrast and something unique to it I think that works really well with this outfit. Here we have another great execution of like the classic menswear uniform with a little bit more prep so we've got that Glen plaid or Prince of Wales check jacket. That's really nice. Got to know where you got that, so leave a comment down below. I really like the Fox tie. That kind of emerald green color really pops the brown, the lighter color browns that you have. It really works so well with. Instead of gray trousers, it kind of went with an oatmeal or I think they call it biscuit. That's a really nice choice. This is a really great look. I might have to cop that at some point. Okay, here is 38. This is Will coming at us with a super casual look. Again, like the best, like most interesting or one of the most interesting things about this look is the like Fisherman's kind of cable knit, cream colored sweater, always a great option. And then keeping it more casual with I believe those are dark denim or black jeans and the of the boots really pairing well with the brown of the leather jacket. Super cool. Like this outfit a lot. Here we have, I've looked for your name but I couldn't find it. But this is Gent of DC which I live in Baltimore so he's not too far away. And if you're if you're watching this video like send me a no or send a leave a comment because we should hook up at some point. I like this look because of the use of the chunky shawl color cardigan as an alternative to a blazer. You've got like a really dressy pant in the chalk stripe. I assume that's flannel. And the navy turtleneck, this is a great, like it's just a really good like dress down more casual laid back kind of sophisticated way to do it with the cardigan layered over that like that. But what I really like here is like the extra step that he went to take with the pocket square to make it really show to really show you that this is like he's wearing it as a blazer alternative. I've never seen that before so it's really cool really cool here. And then our Our last outfit here, I had to include, this is our good friend, Han. Han is a super fan. I love his comments all the time. If you watch the videos, you've definitely seen Han's comments. He sent this in really nice overcoat, Burberry scarf. I think he said it was a trip he took recently, so hope that you had a good time there when you were there. Thanks for sending it in. So I know that I said I had rounded up my top 10 favorite, and that is actually over on the website. There's a link to it right over there, so hop over there and see if you made it onto the top 10 list. We're going to keep doing this, so from time to time, I think maybe the next time will be in spring, but thank you to everyone who sent outfits in, and we'll see you over on the website and in the next video."

        "transcript": " If one day you decided to make a huge change and start rebuilding your wardrobe from scratch, which pieces would you choose? Or better yet, which pieces should you choose and why? There are some key principles to consider and in this video I'm going to share those with you and show you how to build the ultimate beginner's essential capsule wardrobe. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we've got all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. If you've gotten to that point where you are ready to make a change where you're ready to make that commitment to improving or upgrading your wardrobe, you want to know, right, what are the pieces that I need? If you're going to spend the money, you want to know that one, you're buying the right things and two, that you will be able to get a ton of use out of those items. What's the point of buying something or investing in something if you're only going to be able to wear it one way, especially since what you're really investing in is yourself. So what we're focusing on here are those foundational pieces that once you have, you can continue to build out from there. All 25 pieces I'm gonna show you are incredibly versatile and to illustrate that, I'm going to be putting them together into 20 different looks later on in this video. One final thing to note is that I'm considering this a wardrobe upgrade. So some of those more casual staples like a T-shirt or a Henley, for example, are not included here. I've divided it up into five categories. We have dressy pieces, business casual slash casual pieces, footwear, outerwear and accessories. And now let's take a look at what those pieces are. Up first is a navy hopsack suit. You know, even if you don't wear a suit on a regular basis, it's important to have at least one suit in your wardrobe. I chose one in hopsack because of the fabric's versatility. Makes it very easy to break apart and wear the jacket, especially as a separate. Item number two is a sport coat or odd jacket. This is really gonna expand your options in the business casual realm. You're gonna want one with a pattern or a texture like the gun club check I've chosen here. But if you want something say less for season and a little more fall, winter, a jacket and tweed or flannel would be my choice there. Item number three, a white poplin shirt. This is going to be one of your workhorse shirts and absolute essential. Number four, we have an ice blue Oxford cloth shirt. It's great dressed up, but because the fabric is a little heartier than poplin, it's gonna work really hard for you in those business casual and what I'd call elevated casual scenarios. Number five, I'm throwing in a striped shirt here. Good to break things up with a pattern, gives you more options. And for this one, I also like it in an Oxford cloth. Item number six, a pair of mid-grey trousers. You know, a suit will only get you so far. So having an extra pair of trousers is an absolute must. And this pair in particular is among the most versatile that you'll find. Moving on now to our business casual slash casual category and starting off with item number seven, which is a V-neck sweater. This is an important layering piece and I chose one in a light gray because I think it's a touch more versatile than navy. Number eight, we have a much more casual gray option with a crew neck athletic sweatshirt. Number nine, I'm throwing in another white shirt here. This one though, much more casual, a white OCBD or Oxford cloth button down. The button down collar is gonna make it a much more natural fit for outfits in that casual range. Item number 10, a denim shirt. Great for dressing down a suit and an absolute no-brainer as it gives you so many different options throughout your wardrobe. Items number 11 and 12, we've got two pairs of cotton pants, navy and khaki. Then items 13 and 14, two pairs of denim jeans. Dark denim, which will be the most versatile pair. And then light denim to cover the more sporty and casual side of things. Onto footwear now, number 15, we have a pair of dark brown oxfords, 16 pair of leather tassel loafers, 17 burgundy cap toe boots, and then rounding it out with 18, a pair of white leather sneakers. Moving on now to outerwear and item number 19, we've got a navy overcoat. Now this is gonna be your dressiest coat for your suited and more dressed up business casual looks, though as you'll see, it can be styled in a more casual and sporty way. Next number 20, a classic navy P coat, great everyday coat, very easy to style, And then rounding out our outerwear category here, item number 21, a more casual coat. And for this one, I've selected a barber waxed cotton jacket in the classic olive color. Final category here, accessories. We've got a navy grenadine tie, a white pocket square, a leather belt, and then finishing things off with item number 25, we have a watch. Not to get too specific about brand because that will be so variable between different people, but just to focus on watch style for a second, you want something that's gonna be versatile. So we're talking simple dial, and then whether you choose a leather strap or a metal bracelet just kinda depends on your overall aesthetic. For the purposes of this scenario, I'm choosing one on a brown leather strap, and I'll leave some options at various price points down below in the description. Okay, cool, 25 pieces. Now, what can you do with them? Well, let me show you just 20 different outfit ideas and possibilities. I Oh I'm a singer I'm a talker I'm a singer No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Hey!

        "transcript": " If you've watched the channel for a while now, you know that I really love watches, especially nice watches. But it wasn't like the first watch that I ever owned or watches that I've had throughout my life have always been luxury watches. Getting into and appreciating watches, developing and refining my taste in watches is something that has been a very long journey. And you're gonna find out how I eventually found myself walking into the Rolex boutique on Fifth Avenue in New York City with a pocket full of cash ready to buy my first luxury watch, a Rolex Datejust. So the first watches I ever had as a kid were a Timex Ironman Triathlon. I love that watch. Don't know whatever happened to it, but I'm seriously considering searching on eBay to try and find one purely for sentimental reasons. Also as a kid I had a neon colored swatch that had a rotating bezel. And then of course there was the Gucci, obvious scare quotes there that I bought on Canal Street, i.e. not a real Gucci watch on a class trip to New York City when I was in high school. There was a period of time when I didn't really think about watches that much at all. I was in college, grad school, and I was just laser focused on that experience practicing my saxophone, playing gigs, and watches kind of took a backseat to all of that. But then once I got settled, had a job, and finally started thinking more about improving how I dressed, building up my wardrobe, that's when I began scratching the surface of the watch hobby. Watches in my mind were a finishing touch to an outfit and also like clothing, a way to communicate something about yourself. My first foray into watches at that time was very modest. I didn't really know anything other than that. I wanted a watch that I could wear with a lot of stuff and had a timeless, no pun intended, really look. And I also didn't really know where to look for watches. So the first one I actually got was from J Crew and it was the Timex T2N321 Circa 2010 for J Crew came on a brown leather strap. And I also ordered a black strap for it from Amazon as I recall. Very small and elegant stainless steel case, simple dial with the date window. I wore this watch all the time. And if you go back to the early years of HSS on the website, you'll see this watch in pretty much every single post. So that was kind of the watch that rekindled my interest. And shortly after that, I started getting the urge to have more options. The Timex was great, but I wanted something on a metal bracelet and in a gold tone. So I went to the mall and I bought a Citizen EcoDrive. And then eventually I spent a little bit more and got a UniformWear C40, which is a cool minimal watch with a day-date. So you're probably wondering, like how does someone go from a $600 UniformWear's watch to a new Rolex Datejust, which was actually my next watch after the UniformWear's, because I'll admit that is a huge leap to make. For me, it was a combination of two things. It was circumstance, and it was also, because I am who I am, the fact that watches really became a very strong interest. And when I get into something, I pursue it with passion. And if it becomes a goal, it's something that I try my hardest to achieve. So Rolex had become in my mind at that particular time the pinnacle of arrival. Now you could be cynical about their marketing and how they position themselves as the reason that that thought was in my mind. And maybe that's the case. And if so, good for them. But there's also a reason that Rolex is Rolex and why people sometimes say bow to the crown. Although they might not make the most beautiful movements in the world, there is no disputing that they are exceptional quality and have an amazing history. But back to circumstance, Rolex is a luxury brand and it's a luxury price point. So you've got to be in some sort of financial comfort zone to afford one. He spoke style, had been doing very well, and that put me in a position to seriously consider this purchase. And although it might sound cliche, but marking that kind of milestone with something like Rolex watch really added to that sense of achievement and accomplishment that I felt. Something that I would have and something that I could always look to and remember the pride that I felt about that. Obviously, and again, because I am who I am, I didn't just run out the next day and buy a watch. I'd never spent that amount of money on anything all at once. So I dove into sort of an insane level of figuring out what the perfect Rolex was going to be for me. And that started with going to the boutique and actually trying a few models on. Robin was living in New York at the time, so we were kind of back and forth every other weekend. So on one of the trips up there, I went to the Rolex boutique on Fifth Avenue and also hit up Torno. The experience of actually putting these watches on my wrist for the first time was kind of transformative. I'd only been used to relatively inexpensive watches and there is a very different feel on the wrist when it comes to a modern Rolex. It has a solidness and heft that for me was just really unexpected and made a very big impression on me. It just felt like this is a high quality watch. Two questions I bet you have right now are how and why did I settle on a Datejust and why did I choose to purchase brand new instead of pre-owned? Although I briefly considered a Submariner, I settled on the Datejust for a few reasons. I wanted something that was classic. I wanted something that was versatile. And I wanted something that leaned more toward the dressy side of things because that tends to be more of my default mode of dressing. So once I'd settled on the Datejust, though, there was still a big decision I had to make between an oyster bracelet or a jubilee bracelet. Oyster would be more casual and jubilee would be a little more dressy. And once again, I leaned more dressy because it matched my style and seemed a little more special to me. And then size 36 millimeter, verse 41, I chose 36 because it was more classic and fit my wrist a lot better. Now, new verse pre-owned. I wanted to buy new simply because I wanted the watch to be completely mine. I didn't want to have a story before me. I wanted to write its history myself. So as I tell it here in all of two minutes, it makes it sound like it was a pretty simple process that I went through and that it didn't take long at all to arrive at my final decision. but in reality, I agonized over this for a good nine months. I'm gonna spend all this money, I better make sure that I've done all my research and that I am 100% confident that this is indeed the watch that I want to buy. I spent a lot of time reading articles, I spent a lot of time on the forums, I spent a lot of time on the Rolex website playing with different configurations. Once I arrived at my decision, however, I went to the bank, made the trip to New York for the weekend, and before we left the apartment, and this sounds like completely ridiculous, but Robin had a colleague at the time who ran this Instagram account called Cash Cats, which was like photos of cats laying around in piles of money. So we actually took a picture of her cat, Ringo, for Cash Cats. See, I told you it was ridiculous. So the transaction in the boutique was kind of the most boring part of the whole affair. And the only thing that kind of sucked about it was that instead of leaving with the watch on my wrist, I actually had it mailed to me in Maryland so it came like a few days later. So that's the story. Now let's take a closer look at this watch and all of its details with some good old-fashioned watch porn. So here it is, my Rolex Datejust reference 116234. It is a 36-millimeter case in oyster steel in white gold. It's got a screw-down case back, which you can't see through, and a screw-down crown, jubilee bracelet giving it a dressier look. Also contributing to that dressier feel, it has a fluted bezel, which looks amazing as it catches the light. I mentioned that I wanted something extremely classic, so I went with a silver dial and stick pin hour markers, hour, minute, and running seconds hands. It does hack, which if you are really anal about setting the time accurately is an awesome feature. It is an automatic movement, and of course, the real signature feature is the Cyclops, which magnifies the date window. This watch looks great on the wrist, and I feel like 36 millimeters is a perfect fit for my 6.5 inch wrist. It's incredibly comfortable to wear. It still is one of my favorite watches. Gets a lot of wrist time and it will always have a very special meaning to me. As I went through the process of buying this watch, I learned a lot. And if you find yourself in a similar position as I was, really wanting a Rolex to be your first luxury watch purchase, I put together a video linked right over there that goes even deeper and gives you some really important questions that you should be asking yourself to see if this is the right choice for you."

I knew why I was going, but I wasn't exactly sure how it was going to go or really have any idea of how significant this trip would be. That's something I wouldn't realize until many, many years later. So I was headed down to DC because a custom clothing company from New York that I had read about and heard really, really great things about was setting up shop in DC and was actually offering pretty nice discount for first time DC clients. This was during the very beginning of He Spoke Style and at a time when I really started to get serious about developing my wardrobe and investing in it. So seemed like a good trip to make. I parked just off Dupont Circle and walked a few blocks to a small townhouse. I rang the doorbell, was buzzed in and taken upstairs to the second floor. There I was greeted by by a very elegant room, dark hardwood floors, slate gray walls, fireplace, a couch, a few perfectly placed rugs, a single table with four chairs around it, a couple Taylor bus, elegantly styled a wet bar, and a hutch stocked with fabric books. Next, a gentleman came in, shook my hand, and we sat down together at the table. This was my first time meeting Mike of Michael Andrews. Now remember that this is kind of the beginning of me seriously getting into men's style, actually only my second time doing a custom suit, which is to say that I was not prepared at all. I kinda knew what I wanted, but not really. And when it came to all the details, so many options, I was just completely overwhelmed. In fact, I'm not ashamed to admit that a lot of things, I didn't even know what they were at the time. So my appointment kinda took a little bit of time, probably more time than Mike was used to spending on a single client who was, you know, only gonna buy one suit and two shirts. After all that time, I finally decided on a brown Donagall tweed three-piece suit that I did with a notch lapel, flat pockets, suede elbow patches, which is honestly something I'd wanted since my undergraduate days. Double vent side adjusters on the trousers with a two-inch cuff. And for shirts, I did a blue micro-stripe and another stripe shirt that had like kind of a blue and brown double stripe. I love that suit when I got it, and I got it just in time for the fall winter season of that year. It was 2013, we featured it many times on the He Spoke Style website, showing its versatility. It's a suit that is still in my rotation and actually the tweed jacket that you've seen on the channel frequently is the jacket from that suit. Now over the years as I continued growing HSS, I had the opportunity to try many different made to measure and custom suit programs. Some really well known, some online only, some small shops, pretty much the entire gamut of what was available. But one thing that remained constant throughout all that time is that I always kept coming back to MAB. The other products were okay, some hit or miss, but usually there was something about the product that I just couldn't get past. It would always come into small or short, despite a very rigorous measuring process. Some of the programs have a complete lack of control over certain things that were sort of non-negotiable for me, like a lapel width, for example, or having a cap on how big you could make the cuff on your trousers. And then that was the fact that a lot of these companies seemed kind of faceless. Maybe they advertise the personal attention that you would get, but part of the joy of the sartorial world is those relationships that you create with the people responsible for making your clothing. You don't want the process to be simply transactional. It should be about sharing a passion for style and the craft of tailored clothing. To be honest, the holy grail is getting to a point where you can just tell your guy what you want and then expect that with little to no input from you that he knows exactly what that is and that when the garment is delivered that you are completely satisfied. That is why MAB was different for me and it's one of the reasons that I kept going back to them so consistently over the years. Michael Andrews was and still is a relatively small team of warm, caring, passionate and just nice people. All my favorite suits were from MAB. I'd never experienced such a personal level of customer attention. I mean, they'd remember birthdays, anniversaries, and it wasn't just like some bot decided to send me an email. Corey and Mike would literally text me to let me know that they had remembered. Because of that synergy and because of the way our values align, caring about quality, caring about the people that we connected with, it was, I would say, about two years ago that we started having conversations about partnering in a more meaningful and lasting way. Michael Andrews has a great product that I personally love. So aside from the few regular trunk shows here and there and a handful of cities and the showroom in New York, they only had that in-person experience which made it very difficult if not impossible for the people who followed me to see what it was all about. And add to that that they were only offering a bespoke garment. That meant the price was higher than I knew that many of you might be comfortable with. My goal has always been to make it easier for you guys to dress well, look your best, feel your best, and in the process have more confidence in yourself and to use that confidence to do whatever it is and achieve whatever it is that you want to. And part of that is to be able to share and give you access to the clothing that has had that effect for me in my life. That is why we put our heads together to find a way to bring Michael Andrews into the HSS shop to give you an online custom clothing experience that only they can deliver and at a price point that is better in terms of the level and quality of what you are getting than the competition. Now, let me talk a little bit about what really differentiates Michael Andrews. They have their own workshop and they actually own their workshop. They make all their patterns in-house, which is cool because it allows me to create some pieces that I envision to give you some more unique options here and there than what you would normally find from similar companies in the custom clothing industry. Over the years, Michael Andrews has also created a network of partnerships with other top-tier craftsmen, which gives them a much greater depth of knowledge, experience, and ability than any other custom clothier out there. And because of that, that's why we're able to offer you a curated selection of not just suits, shirts, and sport coats, but also shoes, knitwear, belts, ties, and accessories. Of course, when you're talking about custom clothing and especially online custom clothing, the most important thing, aside from quality, is the fit of the garment. And here is a place that I know Mike and his team absolutely deliver. As you go through the process, you'll work closely with them to achieve a fit that is as close to their in store bespoke as possible. We've been testing this out for well over a year now. And to be completely honest, I was a little scared in the beginning because I didn't want this service to have any sort of compromise at all. And when we got those first garments back, we were all absolutely blown away by how good it was. This whole new adventure is all about you guys. And what this partnership does is that it gives us an infrastructure to deliver you an exceptional product with world-class customer service. And because we've brought on MAB as our partner for that, it frees me up and gives me a greater ability to continue to give you guys even higher quality content than you've become accustomed to. I know some of you are going to have questions about objectivity and so on and so forth going forward. What I can promise you is that nothing on this channel will change. It's not going to become a huge commercial. I've seen other people go down that path and that is not what is going to happen here. I'm gonna continue sharing the things that I'm passionate about across a variety of categories and you will continue to get all the knowledge, tips and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. Everything is now live on the site and what I really wanna do is encourage you to check it out, browse the collection, but most importantly, give us some feedback. We want the experience to be the best out there. We wanna make the site better every day and you guys are the ones who can give us the best feedback. So please hop on over there, check it out, and let us know what you think."

        "transcript": " Some upgrades, some updates, and some updates. some new pieces, let's take a look at my 2020 everyday carry. But first, I want to let you know that this video is sponsored by Blinkist, which is an app I've been using for a while now. And what it does is it summarizes and rounds up all of the best parts of over 3,000 nonfiction books that you can either read or listen to in just 15 minutes. I really like it as kind of a quick way to learn and reinforce some key concepts about things that I am currently focusing on because The more you repeat it, the more likely it is to sink in. A couple books that I am loving at the moment and that I really recommend are Storyworthy by Matthew Dix. If you are at all interested in how to tell a compelling story about anything, definitely check that one out. And also a book that I read back in grad school that I've been thinking about recently is Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott. It's simple advice about writing well that I like to revisit whenever I can. If you're If you're interested in signing up for Blinkist, the first 100 people to go to that link that I have down below in the description will get unlimited access for one week to try it out. The trial is completely free and you can cancel at any time. And then after the trial, if you do go for the full membership, you'll also get 25% off. They do have now a new full length audiobook feature as well, and premium subscribers get special member pricing, which is up to 65% off the regular price. Up first, the phone. I just upgraded from an iPhone 10 to the iPhone 12 Pro. Not the max size for me, that's just a little too big for my hand. One of the most amazing things about this phone, and you've probably heard it already, is the camera. Just completely incredible. Absolutely mind blowing for a phone camera. The performance in low light in particular is ridiculous. And it takes awesome video. In fact, all of the overhead shots that you've seen in our videos recently, I've been taking with the iPhone. Good upgrade, super happy with it. Another Apple upgrade here, courtesy of my wife, I've got now the AirPods Pro. I'm never like the first person to jump on new Apple products, but I remember when these first came out that people were just crazy about them and having these now myself, I can totally see or hear why. The biggest upgrade is the silicone tip, which secures it in your ear much better and gives it really great noise canceling capability. And there's also a transparency mode that allows you to hear what's going on around you while still getting a pretty awesome audio experience. Next is a holdover from last time, no need to upgrade here. And that is my Goyard card case. Little piece of luxury that I enjoy carrying around. Not a big wallet person or a big wallet person. So I much prefer the slim profile of a card case like this. Gotta have a mask these days. And this is the one I've been taking with me quite often. It's by Michael Andrews. We have them available in the shop. This one is wool. Love the plaid pattern, full coverage. The chin cup is a great addition for comfort and for helping it fit better. The elastic straps are adjustable. It's got a bendable wire nose bridge, Bemberg lining with a pouch for a filter if you wanted to use one. I've worn a few different kinds of masks since the beginning of the pandemic. And I have to say that this one is the best looking and most comfortable that I have found. I always carry a pen with me and the one that I've been enjoying recently is the Parker Jotter. I like how it writes, it's got a really nice feel in the hand, very light. You may remember this as the pen that Q gives James Bond in GoldenEye that is actually tricked out as a class four grenade. Three clicks to arm it, and three clicks to disarm it. The pen is mightier than the sword, as they say. I like to carry a notebook as well And if I'm not carrying around a bag, this little Field Notes notebook is just great for slipping in a pocket. As I mentioned before, I like to write ideas down when I have them and doing it in the phone is a sure fire away for me to never see them again. I always forget that I wrote them down. Writing them in a notebook though is a much better method of keeping track of things for me. I'm including the watch that I've been wearing most these days and that is my new Omega Speedmaster, first Omega in space. It's such a great everyday watch that looks good on pretty much any strap you put it on, though my favorite has been this suede strap that I have it on here. If you want the full story on why I decided to buy this watch and add it to the collection, even though I thought I would never be a Speedmaster owner, I did a complete video on all of that that is linked right up there. It's cold out now, which means I'm wearing a hat a lot more, which means that when I take my hat off, that I need to fix my hair. So I always have with me this little pocket comb. It's made by Abbey Horn for us. As you can see, we have the HSS monogram on the comb, as well as a leather sheath. Currently sold out of these, but there are still some of the larger dressing combs available. Another little upgrade here from my keys. This is a leather key ring by Ettinger. It's a British brand, so it uses what is considered the most traditionally English of leathers, bridal hide, and a beautiful green color, which is a great pairing with the gold hardware. The shape of the D-ring here is actually inspired by the handle anchors of Ettinger's traditional attaché cases. And on the end of those bulbs, a really great detail with the etched etcher monogram. Well, in addition to it being colder now, it's also getting darker a lot sooner and the dog still needs to go for walks. So when I go out for that, I've always got a flashlight with me. And a while ago, I did actually splurge on this flashlight here. This is the Beagle by Mouchand. It's machined from titanium. It's a nice size that fits really well in the hand and the weight feels really good in the hand. It's got five beam intensities that you can activate with a half push of the power switch. Believe it or not, I consider a small flashlight to be an essential accessory for any guy. You don't need a mouchand and in the video I did on the 15 essential accessories for guys, I have a much more budget friendly alternative. Find out what that is along with the 14 other essential accessories by clicking on that video right over there."

        "transcript": " What would you do if you were given $5,000 and the only strings attached to it were that you had to build the perfect Three-watch collection? How would you decide which watches to choose? But more importantly, which watches would you choose? It's an interesting question, isn't it? Well, I've got a few ideas myself and you're gonna find out what they are right after this I'm Brian Sakowin you're watching he spoke style where we've got all the tips knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. This video is sponsored by Chrono24 and very excited to partner with them as it's a website and app that I have used for a very long time. In fact, you may remember that I mentioned their market tracking capability in the video where I told the story of how and why I sold my Patek Philippe 5711. What you need to know is that Chrono24 is a luxury watch's only marketplace with both new pre-owned and rare vintage finds. Over 500,000 watches listed by trusted dealers and private sellers from all over the world with 120,000 of those listed from within the United States alone. They have what they call a trusted checkout service, which gives you peace of mind and a secure way to shop brands like Rolex, Omega, Tudor, Cartier, you name it, you're going to find it on Chrono24. One of the best things that they have though is an extremely comprehensive filtering feature. A lot of times, you know, you may be looking for something very specific and it's super nice to be able to really zero in like that because it makes it so much easier and less time consuming. I've got links down below for you to check out Chrono24 as well as links to all of the watches I'm going to be mentioning in this video. So as I was thinking about which watches to pick, I came up with some criteria that really guided the choices that I made. With three watches, you have an opportunity to build an incredibly versatile collection and basically to have a watch for any type of situation you would find yourself in. So I decided to break the watches down into three categories. There had to be a dress watch, there had to be a sport watch, and then there had to be what I would call an everyday kind of watch. So dress, sport, and everyday. Also instead of including any new watches, all the choices that I made were pre-owned. A lot of the brands I chose would be considered luxury brands and as you know with a carefully selected pre-owned watch you're getting a much bigger bang for your buck. Because of that prices are variable and as I chose these watches I did my best to kind of survey the price range and make my choices based on the average price that you could expect to pay for the watch in the pre-owned market. Now there are lots of ways that you could allocate $5,000 to build that perfect three watch collection. You could have one watch that you spend most of your budget on, you could try to spread it evenly across the three. There are endless possibilities and I would encourage you to leave your perfect under 5k 3 watch collection down in the comments. As for me, I didn't want to give you just one option so I actually put together two collections, both of which check all my boxes. So without further ado, let's get into them. Starting off the first collection with the Seiko Sarb 033. This is my everyday watch here for this collection, only available as pre-owned now because it is a discontinued model with an average price of around $800. Seiko, of course, great brand history. The design is very simple, great value for the price, and I specifically chose this one as my everyday watch because it is so incredibly versatile. At 38 millimeters, it's a great size for just about any wrist. It's an automatic movement. It's got a see-through case back and an absolutely gorgeous dial. Date window, very practical. Stainless steel bracelet. I love the mix of the polished and brushed steel throughout. It's a beautiful watch that I think looks much richer than its price tag. For our sport watch, I'm going with the Tudor Heritage Black Bay 79230N, coming in at around $3,500. This is a much-loved and very highly regarded watch. 41 millimeter stainless steel case, screw down crown, 200 meters of water resistance, beautiful matte black dial with rose gold plated indices and hands. It's got a unidirectional diving bezel with the 60 minute track printed on the aluminum insert. The automatic movement is the in-house caliber MT5602. Variety of bracelet options, including a steel riveted bracelet, a leather strap with a folding clasp, or a NATO strap. And that really is one of the best parts about a dive watch like this in that you can really increase its versatility and give it an entirely new look just by changing the bracelet. For our dress watch in this collection, I decided to go vintage, and I chose a vintage Omega Seamaster, which comes in at around $700, though they can definitely be found for less than that. I like this one as a dress watch because of its elegance, because of its simplicity, and because of its size. In the realm of vintage Seamasters, you're looking at about a 35 or 36 millimeter case. I love a smaller case size for a dressier watch. I think it gives it a real sense of old school understatement and elegance. And I think of vintage piece when we're talking about dressed up looks or even a formal look is a perfect match. So rounding up and recapping our first collection here at $800, we have the Seiko Sarb 033 at $3,500, the Tudor Heritage Black Bay, and at $700, a vintage Omega Seamaster. Now let's take a look at our second collection. Starting off with the everyday watch, and for this one I'm choosing the Hamilton Cackie Field Mechanical. This is the H69439931 coming in at $500. A little bit more rugged of an everyday pick compared to the Seiko Sar, but this collection I've kind of geared more towards an overall casual feel. We do have a very classic dress watch pick that you'll want to stick around for. This watch though is 38mm, again a very versatile It's got that great military look. You'll see it mostly on a fabric strap, though you can definitely add a leather strap if you like. One thing to know about this one is that it's not an automatic movement, which means you're going to have to wind it. But for me, I love the connection that actually winding the watch creates between you and the watch itself. For our sport watch here, I'm going with the Omega Speedmaster Reduced 351050, coming in at $2,500 that you can find them for less. classic chronograph, unmistakable looks, and extremely versatile as it just looks amazing on so many different types of straps. It's called reduced because of the size. Typical Speedmaster Professional is going to be 42 millimeters. Mine, the first Omega in space, is just under 40 millimeters. And the Speedmaster Reduced is 38.5 millimeters. Just something to be aware of. But if your wrist is on the smaller side and you do love the Speedmaster, This is a great choice at an excellent price point. And to round out the second collection for our dress watch, I'm choosing the Cartier Tank Solo. Now a little bit of a caveat here in that if you've been keeping score, we're already at $3,000, so we've got to find this watch for around $2,000, which I will admit can be a little difficult. Now one thing to keep in mind though when you are dealing with pre-owned watches is that you do have a little wiggle room, especially if you're able to speak directly with a set So basically what I'm saying is it never hurts to ask. This watch though, what can you say about a Cartier tank? It's the epitome of elegance. At this price point, you're gonna be dealing with smaller case sizes, which again, contribute to what I would call the elegance factor. It's one of the small handful of watches that I would consider to be a perfect tuxedo watch. And I know that whether or not to wear a watch with a tuxedo is really one of those questions that really divides people. I would even say that it ranks among the top three most decisive menswear issues. I have a few opinions on it, and I lay them all out in that video right over there. Definitely check that out and add your voice to the very lively discussion in the comments on that one."

        "transcript": " Masks are a fact of life. We've got to wear them, but how do you make a mask look good with your outfit? Well, the first thing to understand is that you can do better than this. And I'm going to show you how in this video, I've got some great mask options, where to get them, as well as five tips for pairing a mask with your outfit coming right up. I'm Brian Sakao and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we've got all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Before we get into the five tips, wanna let you know that we are now offering masks in the HSS shop. They're available in wool and cotton. They're cut to have full coverage. And one thing I really like is the chin cup, which is not only very comfortable, but also helps the mask fit the contour of your face really well. Also to help out with the fit, we've got adjustable elastic straps, a bendable wire nose bridge to ensure a secure fit as well as maximum comfort. Lining is 100% Bemberg with an inside pouch to hold a filter if you so choose. And these masks are hand washable. Links to shop are down below in the description. Now let's get to our five tips for matching a mask to your outfits. Tip number one is to consider the fabric. I do have to say that wearing a mask made from a high quality fabric makes a huge difference in terms of comfort and your ability to integrate a mask more cohesively into your outfit. I started off the pandemic probably like a lot of you wearing those blue disposable masks. If you've worn one, you know that they're not super comfortable, they're itchy, and in terms of incorporating it into a look, it really doesn't look like it belongs. Sticking to masks in wool or cotton, fabrics that are clothes are made of too, helps you to combine them much more seamlessly. One of the ways I found to make a mask look more cohesive with an outfit is to choose one that is darker than the overall look. Honestly, making the mask one of the darkest pieces, if not the darkest piece of the outfit is a great way to have it sort of recede from being front and center. It is an accessory and it's a new accessory that we're all kind of figuring out how to work into our outfits. And I found that having masks in darker solid colors makes it much easier to work them into a variety of different looks from casual all the way to suited in an unobtrusive way. Speaking of suited, here's a suited look to illustrate tip number three, which is to add in a subtle pattern. This is kind of a little bit of a flip flop from the previous tip in that here, we're using this as an opportunity to let the mask take center stage a little bit more, but not too much. A mask with a subtle pattern paired with a very plain, simple outfit is a really nice way to add in some visual interest. Here, I'm thinking of how I'm using the mask visually very much in the same way that I consider the grenadine tie that I'm wearing. There's a subtle texture there that you see when you get closer, that makes it interesting, but is not so in your face that it takes over the entire outfit. Another really easy way to style a mask is to do it monochromatically. If it's the same color as everything else you're wearing, it's going to fit in. But it's also important that you remember the first tip, which is to pay attention to the fabric, because although those disposable masks are blue, they don't really integrate quite as well as one in a nice wool or cotton, for example. With a monochromatic styling, you can also experiment with texture to add a little bit more interest. This mask, although it looks like a solid navy from far away, is actually bird's eye, which I think is a really cool subtle detail. Tip number five is to make a statement. Let's face it, masks stand out, so why not let it become the focus of your outfit? You know, in general, I would say my style is more traditional, kind of on the conservative side, but honestly, I absolutely love this mask, even though it is such a standout piece. The fabric is actually a Super 120s wool from Holland and Sherry. The boating stripe with the kind of preppy overtones really influenced the way I styled this with more or less of a classic menswear uniform. With a turtleneck, the mask really takes the place of like a classic reptile. I do think that since masks are a part of how we dress these days, that it's worth putting the effort into styling them in a coaxiative way. We've got a small but really great selection of masks in the shop, which I've linked to right over there. Click on that, check them out and see if there are any that speak to you and fit your style."

[\"Sweetest Winter Outfit\"] I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we've got all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. This video is sponsored by Gobi Cashmere. Gobi Cashmere uses 100% premium Mongolian cashmere, and what I love about them is not only do they make a great product, but they have a pretty awesome sustainability and ethical mission as well. They've built very close connections and relationships with the nomadic Mongolian herders whose livelihood is connected to their cashmere goats. Gobi is actually the fourth largest employer in Mongolia. They're very committed to equal opportunity and in fact, 75% of their workforce is women. What all this means is that not only do they make clothing that feels good, but it's clothing that you can feel good about. And speaking of their clothing, Gobi has a wide selection available on their website, everything from sweaters, loungewear, accessories, coats, blazers and home products. And because there is no middleman in the retail chain, all of these items are direct from the source, the pricing is outstanding, especially for the exceptional quality product that you are getting. We're getting close to the holidays, so it's the perfect time to think about gift giving, and a really soft, warm, and comfortable cashmere sweater is a gift that I think we could all use this season. Links are down below in the description, and if you're considering one of these pieces as a gift, or maybe as a gift for yourself, we have a code, It's HSS 30, and the first 50 people to use it will get $30 off orders of $150 or more. I've picked out five great sweaters from the collection, all that I consider to be essential for the winter time, so let's now take a look at what those are. Up first, which I'm sure comes as no surprise to any of you, is a basic solid color turtleneck. I chose one here in a cool winter white, which I think is kind of an almost unexpected seasonal color choice. I really like it here because of the contrast it creates with how I styled it, making it very much become the focal point of this outfit. I've got a classic navy P-coat here, some dark denim jeans. This is more or less a casual look, but the turtleneck along with the color dresses it up, elevates it, really gives it a laid back, casual sophistication. Because of that, I chose a pair of brown suede tassel loafers, which I paired with some cream colored socks to kind of pull in the color of the turtleneck. And then on my wrist to finish it off, I have the Cartier Tank American. Next up is a cardigan and not just any cardigan, but a cable knit cardigan. I really like this one because it has that great cable knit look, but it's not overly bulky. I styled it very simply with just a plain white button-up shirt and a pair of khaki cotton trousers, and then anchored with a pair of dark brown suede oxfords. A cardigan like this is a great alternative to a blazer if you're just at home or going to visit friends and family and you want to be relaxed but still look put together, feels very cozy and is a really great option for the season. Essential winter sweater number three is another cardigan, but this one a very different style. Instead of buttons, we have a zipper here, which along with the two pockets on the sides gives this zip up cardigan an overall more casual feel. Especially in a cashmere fabric, It definitely has that effect of elevating a more casual look like I've got here with a brown gingham shirt Light wash denim jeans and white sneakers really digging the cream colored socks if you haven't noticed If you are someone who kind of gravitates towards this more casual button-up shirt and jean style and always find yourself Looking for ways to dress it up a bit without a blazer I really recommend a zip-up cardigan like this as a way to do that for sweater number four we have a patterned turtleneck. Well, just a simple stripe. Now, not only does this turtleneck have a stripe on it, but if you look closely, you can see that it has a really cool and subtle texture as well. The color, a nice rich burgundy. I absolutely love. And one of the reasons that I love it most is that it pairs so well with browns, which as you know, I am a huge fan of. I've got it paired with this great herringbone double-breasted coat along with some brown trousers, a pair of of cap toe boots and the Vacheron Traditionel on the wrist. It couldn't be an almost holiday sweater focused video without including a holiday sweater. Now, I understand that this particular sweater does not necessarily fit into the classic ugly holiday sweater category, but you know, not everyone including me is 100% comfortable with the full on ugly sweater thing. So for those of us, there's a sweater like this, which I would totally wear to a classic family holiday get together. Now, because I know you guys, I'm gonna wager that probably your favorite looks from this video were the turtleneck outfits. And because it's the holiday season and I'm in the giving spirit, I've got a video with 10 more turtleneck outfits you can try. So click on that video, hop over there, and get inspired."

        "transcript": " Alright, here we are with the highly anticipated, frequently requested, State of the Watch Collection video. We're going to break it down into four different sections. First, what is still in the collection from last time. After that, we'll talk about what's gone and why I decided to get rid of those watches. Then we'll take a look at what's new in the collection. And finally, my wish list for the future. There's lots of changes, including what I really want to add to the collection, so be sure to stick around for that. All right, quick recap of what I still have in the collection from last time. Starting off with the Seiko 5 SNK809, in my opinion, best bang for the buck watch under $200. Next, Rolex Datejust, reference 116234, my first luxury watch purchase, and as a result, a very special watch for me. Another special watch here, Cartier Tank American, the watch my wife gave to me on our wedding day. Alanga and Zuna datagraph, that's going nowhere. And just because, let's have some gratuitous shots of the case back. [\"Hoyer Carrera Limited Edition Blue Dreamer\"] Also still in the collection, the Hoyer Carrera Limited Edition Blue Dreamer, this is number four of 100, the Workhorse IWC Angenur, and the Swatch System 51 Vintage 84. Now let's talk about what is not in the collection Obviously, the big one you already know about if you're a fan of the channel is the Patek Fleeve Nautilus 5711. If you are just happening upon this video, you can watch the entire video I did on why I decided to sell it, my complete thought process behind it, and how much I actually sold it for with the link right up there. Also gone from the collection is the Cartier Drive. I had one from the first year of production, stainless steel, black dial. This is a cool watch. I wore it, but it was probably one of my least worn watches. 41 millimeters, so it was a little large for my wrist, which is 6.5 inches. I also kind of struggled to find ways to style it. It seemed to require a very specific kind of outfit, and it just didn't find a real permanent place in my watch rotation. Now this one might come as a big surprise to you, but also gone from the collection is my 1977 Rolex GMT Master Reference 1675. It was a special watch. It was a birth year watch, but I just sort of like had my time with it. I was wearing it less and I found myself kind of enjoying looking at it more than actually wearing it. And I'm someone who likes to wear my watches, not just treat them as museum pieces that are viewed under a glass case. So because I was sort of tipping that way with this one, I decided to let it go. And I actually sold it to my friend, Eric Wynne from Wynne Vintage. And I know the question everyone will have with this one, as well as the other two watches that I let go is, do I miss them? And actually the answer is no. I don't miss them at all, not even one bit, so I feel pretty good about the decisions I made. When some doors close, others open, or when you finish a book, there's always the next book to read, and there are a few new editions in my watch collection, five to be exact, and now I'm gonna take you through what is new in the collection. Up first is maybe the most interesting edition, definitely very unique, and that is this letter opener by Cartier. It's a limited edition. Actually, there were 2,000 of these made. I have number 1123. Very interesting elongated clock face. Reminds me very much of the Tank American. It is a quartz movement, but who cares? It's a really neat piece. As I said, it's very unique, though. They are definitely out there to be had, if you look. I found this one on eBay about six months ago. Got it for a really good price, and based on what I see them going for now, it was kind of a steal. Next new addition to the collection is a pre-bond Omega Seamaster. James Bond, of course, has worn a Seamaster since 1995. And because this one dates before 1995, that's why it's called a Pre-Bond Seamaster. A lot of these tend to be quartz movements. However, this one is actually an automatic movement. It's got a look that's very similar to the Rolex Submariner, although the price is definitely much different. I really like the size of this watch. It's between 36 to 38 millimeters. So it fits my wrist really well. And it has a really nice patina on the hour indices as well as all of the hands, which gives it a great kind of vintage look and feel. Another Omega addition to the collection, this one, a Speedmaster, the first Omega in space. This watch is one that I actually did a complete video for, going through the process of actually buying it, unboxing, talking about why I thought I would never be a Speedmaster owner and what changed my mind and resulted in me purchasing this watch. That video is linked right up there in the right-hand corner if you want to get the complete story. Now this is a watch that has quickly become one of my most worn watches on a day to day basis. It's just so versatile, looks great on a variety of different straps. I have been wearing it mostly on what you see here, which is a really nice brown suede strap. A few years ago, I had the opportunity to work with Vacheron Constantin on a campaign for the launch of their new 56 collection. I really fell in love with the brand at that time, and particularly the way that Vacheron It kind of takes elegance and just goes like that extra little bit further. And this next watch that's new to the collection, which you've seen featured a lot in my outfit videos over the past year, is in my opinion such a great expression of that timeless elegance with a level of detail and subtlety that is just incredible. This is the Vacheron Constantin Traditionel in pink gold. It's a 38 millimeter case, which in my opinion is just the perfect size. The case thickness is great too, 7.77 millimeters, so quite thin. Manually winding, brown alligator strap. See through case back with an absolutely gorgeous movement, though the main attraction with this watch is the dial. Beautiful hour and minute hands, very elegantly placed, small second style, and then of course the beautiful intricate guillochet. In many ways, this watch is a perfect encapsulation of my own personal style in that it's simply elegant, timeless, and really pays attention to those small details which elevates it from a beautiful watch to an incredibly beautiful watch. One of the things I said in my original watch collection video is that I needed to add more gold and in addition to the Vacheron I also have now a beautiful Géger Le Coulte Reverso in pink gold. Now if I had to pick two of my most favorite watch brands ever it would be a tie between Lange and JLC and for the same exact reasons. They're both incredibly elegant, beautiful design, exquisite craftsmanship, and kind of like a real watch lovers watch brand, somewhat under the radar and if you know you know. My Reverso is the medium size. I've tried the large size on and for me I feel the medium size is just a little bit better fit. It kind of wears more elegantly in my opinion. It's got that great Art Deco look and that's actually another thing that I really love about the Reverso model in that its design really hasn't changed all that much from when it first appeared. I have it on the black alligator strap that it came on, such a natural fit with a tuxedo or formal wear, and I'm actually planning on getting a brown strap for it soon so I can wear it more easily on a day to day basis. That's what's new, but as anyone who gets into watches knows, there's always that next one that you are hoping to acquire. And with one notable exception, my wishlist has changed pretty dramatically since last time. First and number one on my wish list is a Lange 1 in Rose Gold. I still think back to a few years ago when I had the opportunity to have one on my wrist for about a month. Such a perfect watch in my opinion from the size 38.5 millimeter case to the quality of the craftsmanship and the finishing and of course that iconic and incredibly unique design of the dial. Next the JLC Master Ultra Thin Perpetual Calendar in Pink Gold. When I went to London on a trip with JLC I got to wear the steel version and then when Robin and I visited the manufacturer last year I had the opportunity to wear the pink gold version and I just absolutely fell in love with it. 39 millimeters is a great size it's timeless but modern I love the moon phase just a really beautiful watch that wears incredibly easily. Another one from JLC that really intrigues me and I would love to find at some point is a vintage memovox. I'd love to grab one from the 50s or 60s. It's an alarm watch, which I think is so cool because we don't think of mechanical wristwatches these days as being used as alarms. And a vintage memovox would be a really cool connection to a specific time in history. And then there is the watch that I am seriously kicking myself for not picking up like six to nine months ago, a polar dial Rolex Explorer II. Seriously, like nine months ago, these things were going for around $5,000 and now they're in the $7,000 to $9,000 range. It's such a great everyday watch. It's incredibly versatile. It's sporty. I like that it has a GMT complication. You know if you're watching this and you're like, I want a nice watch too but I don't want it to be a Rolex and I don't want to spend more than $3,000. There are actually a lot of great brands that fit that bill and I put together a video that's right over there that will take you through five of my favorite picks."

        "transcript": " Here's the formula. Start with a foundational suit, add two shirts, throw in an extra pair of pants, one sweater, a sport coat, a top coat, a tie, two pairs of shoes, and you have yourself a capsule wardrobe. Ten pieces and coming right up, five ways to style them. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we've got all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. Starting off actually with a fragrance recommendation for all these looks, Santa Maria Novella Tobacco Toscano. It's a very rich scent, slightly smoky tobacco, hint of vanilla, perfect for the season. All right, kicking off the week here with a fully suited all business look. For a winter suit, you want one in a heavier fabric like a flannel or as I'm wearing here, a very heavy wool. Double breasted, I think, is also great for winter. Extra coverage equals extra warmth. And with a heavier fabric, a cuff on the trouser is always a good choice. I styled the suit here with the solid ice blue shirt and then a brown patterned tie, both from HSS Michael Andrews. Top coat with the great herringbone pattern is by Ring Jacket. On my wrist, as you'll see throughout all these looks, is my Vacheron Constantin traditionelle. And then I went with the leather tassel loafers. I like how they're both dressy and laid back at the same time. Okay, for this next look, I stuck with the same pants. When you have a winter suit in a fabric like this, it's very easy to combine the separates with different pieces and heavier winter fabrics. I swapped a suit jacket, though, for this tweed sport coat. And since that kind of gives it a more business casual feel, I changed out the solid shirt for this wide blue stripe. I kept the same tie here because I liked the pattern mixing with a shirt, which also contributes to the relaxed feel here though, it still appears very professional. Little extra contrast via the pocket square and dark brown suede oxfords to again, straddle that dressy casual line. Look number three, same pants again, and I also kept the striped shirt and tie from the last look. Biggest difference of course, is that I am not wearing either the suit jacket or the sport coat. Instead, I added in this lightweight wool v-neck sweater. This is also from our collection And I can kind of low key announce right here and right now that we will finally be launching right after the new year. We decided to revamp the website in addition to the shop. So that couple with COVID has delayed us slightly, but it looks amazing. And I promise that it will have been worth the wait, especially because so many of you have asked about the deep V of this particular Vnex sweater. First things first, I'm sorry. I know I'm cheating a little bit here. I did add in an extra tie. But I wanted to have something that sort of complemented the fabric of the sport coat and also gave a little bit more of an accent in terms of color since I swapped the navy blue pants for this pair of brown pants. Hopefully you'll forgive me. The contrast between the jacket and pants here as opposed to the navy pants is less in terms of color, but I really think that because they're both brown that it really highlights the texture of the jacket. Overlook, the Sportcoat plus trousers plus tie look as a great alternative to a full suit. It still has that professional look but feels a lot more relaxed and I would even say confident and self-assured. A little bit more of a casual Friday approach here, losing the tie, going with the suit jacket as a separate, brown pants, striped shirt and suede oxfords. Wearing the double-breasted jacket without a tie dresses it up a bit more than if I just had on a single-breasted jacket. I think also unbuttoning and extra button helps play with the line of the lapel a little better. Perhaps more than professional, I would put this in the business casual category. But the great thing about winter style is that even when you are in business casual territory, it tends to look a little more elevated and complete. As you've seen, it's very easy to do. And that video right over there will give you five more business casual winter outfit ideas. you"

        "transcript": " We've got a plaid flannel shirt, denim shirt, henley, tan crewneck sweater, dark denim jeans, charcoal flannel pants, a classic pea coat, a warm fleece half zip, suede oxfords, and oxblood boots. 10 pieces and 5 everyday winter outfit ideas coming right up. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we've got all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. My fragrance pick to go with this wardrobe is the all-time classic Ralph Lauren Polo Green. Smells like the season and is versatile enough to go with both the casual as well as the dressier looks and reminder that links to everything are down below in the description. Simple, classic, and American is the concept I was going for with this particular capsule wardrobe. That's one reason I think the fragrance fits so well. And in this first look here for my outer layer I've got the P-coat which is from Theory. Underneath we've got the plaid flannel shirt which I just picked up from J. Crew Factory. I really like the kind of classic and understated blue green and white plaid and then over that I layered a light tan crewneck sweater which is from Everlane. Dark denim jeans are by double RL and then the Oxblood boots are by Bostonian. The watch I'm going to be featuring throughout this whole video is my Omega Speedmaster first Omega in space. For the second look here I am keeping the pea coat, the jeans and the boots and then switching up the top. Layering is one of the key ideas to think about and incorporate into your winter looks. Previous look we had the sweater and here I'm doing more of a base layer situation with a thermal Henley. This cream colored Henley I have is by Vince. It's super warm and feels amazing because it is in a wool and cashmere blend. And then over that I layered a western denim shirt which is by Polo Ralph Lauren. This outfit really is a great everyday casual look and I think the layering as well as the timeless pieces just make it come together in a very cohesive way. Going into a little bit more of a sporty direction with this one with the addition of this half zip fleece. I picked this up recently from Lululemon. It's very warm. I love the color, which is super versatile. And then the texture is just a really nice touch that makes it more interesting visually and just feels really nice. Underneath that, I've got the denim shirt, which once again I layered the Henley underneath for a little extra warmth. Stuck with the gray flannel pants, I love to pair dressier elements with more sporty pieces such as the fleece and denim shirt. It's a very kind of American style and one that I feel very comfortable in. And then I finished this look off with the suede oxfords. I really like this next outfit because I think it's a great example of how to look put together but stay casual and relaxed at the same time. Main thing dressing it up here of course is that I swapped the jeans for a pair of charcoal flannel trousers from our collection and although these dress it up slightly I paired them with the plaid flannel shirt up top, which gives it a more dressed down feel. I really like the flannel and flannel combination as well. Instead of the boots, I'm going with the dark brown suede oxfords. This is a great holiday with family look. Even if you're not able to get together with a lot of family this year, this is something you could put on at home to feel festive and make even a simple evening feel more special. Another sporty look here though, a little bit more casual. the Lululemon fleece up top over the sweater and Henley jeans. And then I did go with the suede oxfords here though. I do think the boots would also work as well. Just kind of depends on the overall vibe that you're going for. One of the ways to really change the whole look, feel and silhouette of a look is with your choice of outerwear. Winter obviously, great season for outerwear. And if you're looking for some inspiration or some ideas for pieces that you might want to add to your wardrobe, go ahead and check out that video right over there where I take you through my entire outerwear collection."

        "transcript": " So where were you yesterday? How's that work? Oh really? Are you sure about that? Um, actually I was at a wedding. I don't see any weddings that happened yesterday. Cocktail party? Conflicting stories, but they all seemed plausible. After all, the man was wearing a gray suit, which is quite versatile. [\"The Man Who Was a Gray Suit\"] I'm Brian Sikawa, and you're watching He Spoke Style, where we give you all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Here we are with look number one, and actually, before we get into it, take a moment and let me know what you thought of that intro down below in the comments. Okay, so here we have a super classic, Very conservative business look. Suit is HSS Michael Andrews in a VBC fabric. Two button, peak lapel, flat pockets, side adjusters, pleats, and a two inch cuff on the trousers. Underneath, very simple with an ice blue button up shirt, which I paired with a Brooks Brothers BB number three Reptile for that very classic business look. Continuing that theme with a white pocket square, Datejust on the wrist, and I threw in a pair of cap toe boots just because it is the fall season. Another business look here though maybe a little less conservative and a bit more playful because of the patterns. We've got a striped shirt from our collection and medallion print tie which is by Drake's. It's very simple pattern mixing and follows one of the rules which is to combine two different types of patterns and adding pattern to a suit like this isn't really easy way to make it seem less formal which I continued down below with these suede Oxford's by Scaroso. Get a lot of questions about how to dress for a wedding if you are attending one and right here is one example of how you might do that. Remember the wedding is about the people getting married, not about you, so keeping it very simple and unassuming is an approach that I would take. So here just a simple white shirt with a black grenadine tie, a little bit of texture in the tie adds some interest but doesn't call attention to I have on my wrist, my datejust, and on my feet, a pair of black oxfords. The whole look is just simple, classic, and classy. You knew it was coming, and here it is, suit with a turtleneck, one of my absolute favorite ways to change the entire character of a suit. I just think it gives it a really nice feel of relaxed sophistication. To me, it's a very kind of mature look, and I think it projects a lot of confidence. Another thing that plays into that confident feel here is the fact that this is a monochromatic look. It's a very simple approach, but one that has a lot of impact. No pocket square, just to keep it very clean and minimal. JLC Reverso is an elegant touch and black tassel loafers to continue that relaxed feel. Another cocktail look here, but this one definitely with a bit of a retro feel. Got the collar of the polo over the jacket collar and lapels. look that I do all the time but one that I think is kind of fun to go to in certain situations. The bold black frame glasses by Persol add to that retronus of this look while still being kind of modern. Gray suit obviously very versatile just like a navy suit and I've done tons of navy suit outfit videos here on the channel in the past and I've rounded those looks up 25 of them to be exact in that playlist right over there. So go ahead and click on that for lots more outfit inspiration."

        "transcript": " Are you ready? I'm ready. Let's do it. Alright, first question we have here, where were you guys going? That's in reference to the picture that I put up when I posted. That was New Year's Eve last year. We were going to- This year. Last year. Yeah. New Year's Eve last year. We were going to one of our favorite restaurants, Petit Louie. We have our specific table that we always sit at. So that is where we were going. Question number two, what's the first outfit that I imagine Robin in when I think of her? Ah, thong. That's not an outfit. That goes with an outfit. Um, like you have like great style, but I, I, I just always love when you have just like something simple on like you have right now, like just a pair of jeans and a simple top. I just think you look really, really pretty that way. Thank you. Oh, and vice versa. First thing I think of you, I mean probably a suit or a blazer. I think of like his style, Brian, like walking down the street. What color suit? That's specific. I don't know. Gray, brown. Okay. Brown? Mm-hmm. Suit. There you go. Question number three. Does Robin prefer me with a beard or without a beard? I wouldn't say a beard, well, scruff, yes. But not like too much, not like a full beard, more like sometimes if it gets too long, it gets a little like curly and tickles. So I'd say a good amount of scruff, like right now. Is this a good amount of scruff? I don't know, this is like four days or something. I like that, I like scruff. All right, question number four. What trends do you love or hate? you start with that? I'm not a big trend person. Yeah, I'd say in general I don't love trends because then everyone looks the same or everyone thinks they have to get something because it's cool when it's very cyclical and it comes back every three years or so. So, I mean, we're in a pandemic. I don't know that there's like a a trend other than the sweatpants on the bottom and... What did you call it? An outfit mullet? Outfit mullet. Yeah. Is that a real term? I think it's something. An outfit mullet. Yeah. I'm guilty of that. Not right now though. I do have jeans on. Yes, anyway. What about you? Sure. Trends that I don't really like trends as you know. I can't think of anything off the top of my head. I mean, it feels like it's always like the same stuff, like every season, if you like read the magazines or whatever, they're like, oh, like it's fall now. So we're totally gonna- It's like blue, green. Oh yeah, for guys, it's like olive. Like, oh, olive's gonna be the thing this fall and it never really is. So I don't know, I'm not a trend follower. And that was kind of like a big, I mean, I think you like you evolve. And there are things that I might like appropriate like here and there, if they make sense to me. but I can't think of anything like specifically off the top of my head that I like so. Not a big trend person. Yeah, I mean other than the Blue Ivy, Adidas stuff, there's nothing that I'm like, oh I need to have that the minute it launches, for some reason that's something that I've fallen into. That's your thing, Ivy Park. Blue Ivy. Blue Ivy, okay. Is that different than Ivy Park? It is Ivy Park, you're right. I don't know. No. Blue Ivy's the daughter, Ivy Park. There you go. It's a collection. I did that out. What is the best fragrance for a date? You know what we should do here? We should pick what we like. Yeah, black afghana for you. Really? For a date? Yeah. Like we're going on a date together. Okay. Right? Yeah, that's like sex appeal and musky and... What about for like someone watching who's like you know going on a first date I don't know that I would choose black no I think you said that in the fragrance video that it's something you want you don't want it to be overpowering because if she has a bad reaction to it if she's going to have a bad reaction to you so right right right but for you and me it's black afghan okay yes I you have a couple that I really like when we go out and it depends on the time of day that it is. Like I would say for like just general anytime it doesn't matter. I really like the Frederick Moll portrait of a lady. That's recent. And then for like a more elegant kind of thing, it's a little more distinct, a little more special. That's the Dior private collection, Ud Isfahan. Yeah, that's a really good one. I should note that you've bought all of those for me. The oud Isfahan, I think, is like a really good compliment to Black Afghan or maybe like we would walk into a room and people would be like, whoa, that's way too much. Anyway, Yeah, that I think I got in an Uber like a year ago when the Uber Jarver was really into the perfume, which was a little odd. Okay. How about moving on now? Question number six. What is the best restaurant you've ever been to? Ever? Ever. Are we, we're saying it like together though. Obviously. Obviously. God. That's hard. I feel like we, this sounds pretentious, but when we go somewhere and we travel, we try to go to a really nice restaurant or like a thing that we do is we invest in, like we'll go to a Michelin restaurant when we travel. So that started when we went to Florence, right? So it's gotta be one of those. I was gonna pick that, you know, Teca Pinciori from Florence. That was like the first one we went to. Yeah, that was just a really cool experience. There weren't many people there. But I don't think they like had many tables, but it just felt like really special. And that was like one of the first, I think that was the first Michelin star restaurant that I ever went to. I liked that though. I didn't brace myself enough for that, so I think I had to tap out for one or two courses. Kind of happens all the time. So I would say that restaurant was it like 1990 Bodega something in Barcelona? That we flicked. We stumbled upon, we went to a museum and then we were walking around and I pulled up four square to find like where can we go and eat and we happened upon this I think it's bodega, 1990 something and that was like perfect amounts of tapas and like small bites and they kept bringing us stuff until we said no more but the first bite was that liquid olive. Yeah I remember it. So that was special because It was really good. We didn't realize where we were. And it was just, it was like a weird time too. It was like two o'clock in the afternoon. And then didn't we have like a meal that evening? Probably. Yeah. At the hotel. Was that that day? I don't remember. All right. Where are we at now? Number seven, do you get, do people, do people recognize you on the street? Do you get star spotted? Me? I'm not a star. No. I don't really get it either. Every once in a while I will. And some... It's like in New York when it moves to the... In New York it happens every now and then. Yeah, it's sometimes surprising. Yeah, every once in a while. Yeah. I'm just your wife, I don't get recognized. No? Question eight, this is a good one. Do you recall periods in your life when your style took a big change in direction? I wouldn't say it was good or bad, but I think when I moved to San Francisco, I was 22, 21, 22, when I went to Academy of Art for a semester and I definitely, I wouldn't say like, fell into the trends out there, but there's definitely a different style in San Francisco than there was in New York. And I definitely, I cut my hair, I did like a layer of like blonde on top, darker on the bottom, the things I was buying, I think it was less about things I wanted and more things that were around me and I wanted to fit in. So it was all new. So I wouldn't say it's like something that stuck with me, but I remember it was a very different moment. Do you think it was because to like maybe, you know, like when you travel or people travel, like you kind of like, I don't know, like you're like testing out like something new because like you're not around normal or the people you always see so like maybe you feel like uninhibited in a certain way and like you know you went from the east coast all the way to the west coast so I'm just isn't like a therapy session or anything but probably yeah it was like trying to like reinvent yourself in some way or like find something different yeah I think women also like after a breakup or like their change is usually cutting their hair off so that's usually the main thing versus style overall. That's what I gotta watch out for when you cut your hair. I did that a year ago. Yeah. What about you? For me, I don't think it was like a big change in direction, but it was like more of just arriving at a place where I felt confident in what I was doing. And I would say that was maybe like, I lose track of time now, but maybe like three, four, five years ago when I was just kind of like, you know, it's weird. I rubbed off on you. It's always like, it's weird, you know, like always posting pictures of yourself online and one of the things that I think is unhealthy about it is like, you always- You're over critiquing. Well, no, not that. we always sort of feel the need to do something different and show people something new. Do it for the gram. Yeah, and it's bad for a number of reasons. It gets expensive and it's like, why am I doing this? And I just got to this place where it was, I just felt more comfortable with doing, just doing, like, hey, all right, maybe this is boring and you're tired of seeing it, but I don't care. It's how I like to dress. It works. I found this formula that works for me, and I'm good with that. So that was a big shift, just being comfortable and confident with just doing my own thing and not worrying about all these, or trying to be different, or trying to, you know, there's something good about just having a thing. I'm always envious of people that are like super like, you know, straight ahead on that. I think a lot of the outfits I didn't like in that video that we did were at the end of that cycle. Like doing the hat and wearing the, like there were a lot of like additional touches, which now I think you don't feel the needs like, oh, I need one more thing. Mm-hmm. Question number nine, what is the most fun and bizarre experience you guys have had together? I think we should segment that off into like fun experience and bizarre experience. Or you could take the fun and I could take the bizarre. Yeah, I don't think I have a bizarre. I have a bizarre. The fun... What am I forgetting? The fun would be the BMW road trip. Yeah, I agree. That was, I mean, you really like the car. I just slept in the back of it when you and Robert were driving the whole time, but the experience of just being thrown in the middle of Europe and being given a car and being able to drive around four or five six days that was meeting all those people. Yeah and yeah it wasn't just like we get to see all these things we had to talk to a lot of people we had a lot of great experience. Got to see my man. John Paolo. Hey he's got a girlfriend now. Mazel. All right. Bizarre. Bizarre. So it was when we were in Lake Como for the Concorso. And that first night there was a dinner for you. For you. Right. But so you were up in the hotel in the room. And I was talking with, I thought you were like up and like watching TV or whatever. So I was like talking with Wayco among other people and I was like, oh, my wife, you know, loves you and you know, she'd love to meet you, you know, and he was like going somewhere. So anyway, we like went up to the, it just seems, looking back on it now it seems like really strange that this happened. And I'm always wondering. some man that I admire to the bedroom. Yeah, so we went up and I knocked on the door and it took a little while for you to come to the door. Because I was passed out. Because she was sleeping. Yeah, so like you come to the door and you open it up and you're like, ugh. Probably in a robe or in my pajamas. I'm like, hey, this is Wei and he's like, of course he's very polite and everything. I don't even remember that. I do, but it was a different time. Yeah. So that's what I came up with as I was thinking about bizarre. That's bizarre. That's weird. Yeah. All right. Moving on now to question number 10. What is preferred drink from each of you? I feel like it changes. Yeah, same. Right now, I always go through like the apparel spritz. It's kind of like my drink of choice at home because it sounds like an alcoholic. I like the buzz you get from it more than like drinking a glass of wine or something else. I feel like it's refreshing, but you get like a fun little buzz or a mezcal. Mezcal? Mezcal. For me, it like changes all the time too right now. Maybe because of the season I'm on like a... The groaning? No, no, I do want to speak about the Negroni though. I'm on sort of a cognac or a calvados kind of kick brandy. So I've been drinking brandy and making sidecars. But it changes. It kind of depends on the season. I mean, I'll be drinking a martini soon because it's going to be time to watch the movie. Charles. Time to watch the thin man and everything. Yeah. Negroni. Negroni. Yeah, I don't know. I love Negroni. I had one last night because you made a really nice Italian meal. But I don't know. I'm kind of like, I'm not down on the Negroni, but I'm just a little tired of like all the Negroni idolatry that's happening. It's kind of with the spritz too. Yeah. It's like, okay, I get it. I like mezcal no gronies. Those are good. Yeah. A little twist. Yes. Question number 11. How do you stay connected to the world slash culture of elegance during COVID-19 lockdowns? I don't think I do. I don't at all. I think in the beginning, I was trying to get dressed up and have a day. So wearing like gowns and yeah, I think I made you dinner in like a black gown with champagne. I took your picture. But since I don't, I'm trying not to stay connected to the world right now, honestly, and culture, it's hard. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, scroll through Instagram, that's all, but like, I don't know. There's not like a, some people like every Friday, they'll get dressed up or whatever. We haven't really done that, but, you know. I mean, we had to take a whole bunch of pictures of stuff for Michael Andrews things. So I don't know, I got dressed up a lot for that. Ha ha. Yeah, I don't think we've really been doing a good job at that. No. Question number 12, rules you to follow when coordinating outfits? I mean. Ha ha. This wasn't really on purpose. I don't know that we follow rules. For me, I always try to dress off of what you will wear. But how would you dress off? Like I'm wearing a white dress or something. What would you do from that? I would always like you to be sort of like the focus. And then I pick something that is complimentary to it that doesn't overshadow it. So it's like pulling the color in somehow. Yeah. Question number 13. What are your guilty pleasures? You go first. Guilty pleasures. Cigars. When's the last time I smoked a cigar? I would say that's a guilty pleasure. Every once in a while. I'll feel that, but I don't know that it's a guilty pleasure. I think they were either talking about like bad TV or something. Well, I'd say shopping for me is a guilty pleasure. In the beginning of the pandemic, I bought nothing, didn't need anything, and then after that went on for a few months, I bought something like a pre-order for a black cocktail dress, which it's like something to look forward to when they all need it. It's an investment. I mean, people are saving money right now. I think that's, I would say that's guilty pleasure. It makes me happy. Okay. And sitting on the couch like a bum on the weekends. Once work is done, I turn off the brain. I want to, I enjoy laying on the couch and watching TV for no reason and watching the same thing over and over again. You judge me for it, but I like it. watching Beverly Hills 90210 right now. Yeah, original. Yeah. I don't know that I have a guilty pleasure like that. You work every day all day. Yeah. I mean, you're what you like to do now is like do the crossword. That's not really... That's not a guilty pleasure though. Yeah. You need one. Alright. That should be your... If your suggestions for guilty pleasure sound below in the comments. Yeah All right moving on Question number 14. Do you ever have the feeling of being overdressed in your social circle? Well, I don't really have a circle anymore, so no, but I've always I've been getting overdressed since high school like sophomore, junior year. I've always been... Overdressed or like more put together than your friends are like just putting more effort. I feel like it would it's kind of the same thing. I so I've consistently felt like that though. I guess as I'm older and you're not just hanging out with people you went to school with, you're hanging out with people that like you're choosing to hang out with more. We all kind of do it a little bit more together or it doesn't matters much. It's not such a like, where are you going? It's different for guys, I think. I don't feel overdressed compared to like the people that we are, it's like the feeling of being out of place or something for it. Right. I'm just diminished. When I, I don't, I don't feel self conscious about it necessarily. But definitely, you've also got to like read the room too. I mean, like if you're just going to some like workplace thing and it's, you know, that the people you work with don't dress up like that. And this is not an occasion to do that. Then you shouldn't show up in like a three-piece suit. I wouldn't do that, you know? You kind of like read the room and adjust your trajectory accordingly. So. Though I guess when we went, we went to one restaurant during the pandemic, when it was 25% capacity. and we went to Petit Louis again and we did it for our anniversary and they're mostly people sitting outside and we got our table and there was maybe one or two other tables in that side of the restaurant and I definitely was self-conscious wearing a vintage like cocktail dress would have all these feathers and everything all over. Some of them are still in the car. So that I'd I'd say I felt a little overdone, but it was like the one time we went out in 10 months now. It's fine. Question number 15. Would love to hear your thoughts on athleisure replacing traditional style. This one's to you mostly because I think previously you mentioned something about athleisure. Yeah, it wasn't really into it. Well, I think at leisure's, I've hated that term, I think, and there's different ways you can look at it. I still don't wear leggings out in public other than when I walk the dog or yoga pants, whatever. But since the end of the summer, now that it's fall and it's getting colder, I'm definitely more into it. I've kind of, again, we're in a pandemic. If I don't have client meetings, I'm definitely wearing sweatpants and more casual. But I think the twist now is I like to get sets if I'm going to get the Adidas Ivy Park collection. I got the top and the bottom. When I tried to get it in January, I only got the jacket and I didn't want to keep it. I wanted to like this set. So I feel like if it's more put together or just not like you're not wearing dirty sweatpants out, it's fine. I don't know if that's athleisure now. I think it's like, again, it's dependent on the time and place. Like, you know, I like the Lululemon stuff that I have. I wouldn't wear it to work or I'll wear it out to like run errands or whatever, but that's kind of the extent of it. But to the question of like athleisure replacing traditional style, I mean, I don't, that's not gonna happen. I would say, I hope not, yeah. Yeah. All right, where are we? What is Robin's favorite outfit of yours? I feel like I answered this. I think it's probably your wedding tux. Not because it was the wedding, it was just, it was very you, I mean, you have a ton of me to measure stuff now, but it fit you perfectly the way you were at the wedding versus how you were when you were in London and you had the scruff and everything with it. It's classic, it's elegant, and you look really good in it. Thanks. Number 17, what is my favorite outfit of Robin's? Oh, all of them. That's a cop out, man. One. I mean, you looked gorgeous on our wedding day, But that's not addressed at you. Well, the one, the second one that you wore, my favorite outfit of yours. I mean, I could say like this one. I feel like I know what it is. What? Jeans and a belt and that short sleeve blue cashmere shirt. Yeah, it's, yeah. Every time I put it on you're like classic rock. Yeah, that's exactly like what I was saying in the beginning. Like just simple. You look really good like that. Okay, question number 18. What is one quality that you see in each other that the world could use to be a better place? For you, I would say your drive and integrity. If you say you wanna do something just for yourself, you do it, you're dedicated, you see it all the way through. I have 20 business plans I wanna do and I've started each of them and I just, I can't do it. And just the integrity, so kind of similar, but like if you tell someone else you're going to do something, minus cleaning the house, you follow through. Like if Rob says, can you do something like you're going to do it, it's not like you just ignore it or it falls through, that's, integrity is very important. Thanks. And the world needs more of it. I would say it's the amount that you care for, care for and the concern you have for other people, especially an empathy you show for people and your willingness to want to help them, especially people that don't have as great a situation, you wanna always improve people's lives. I'm doing better picking and choosing who gets that, you know, people who will appreciate it. Okay. Question number 19. What are Robin's thoughts about you collecting expensive watches? I mean, kind of you, it's not that you collect expensive watches. It's the how quickly you'll go into investing it. It's not like it's like one every now and then. Now it's like, it's settled down, but in the beginning you went from, you had no watches to one and then you want another one and another one. Like that piece was hard for me to... It's a sickness. To grasp. Yeah, like I have a shopping problem but that the amount that each piece was, I'm all for investing but the amount you're investing in and the amount each one was was a little... Like I just couldn't... I understood the action but from an expense perspective. It was shocking. Silly to me. Shocking. Yeah. You didn't always tell me how much things cost. I didn't. Okay. And I didn't research because I didn't want to know. All right. This was also before we got married and things like merged a little bit more. So I was like... All right. Question number 20. My girlfriend... My girlfriend will admit that I'm the more stylish one. Where can she find some style inspiration for herself? Depends on her style. Yeah. I think Instagram, it's probably going to evolve over time, but right now that's where I typically get my inspiration used to be Pinterest and it would be like saving things there, reading certain magazines, but like street style used to be where I got inspiration, but now it's kind of turned into following certain people on Instagram. Who are your favorite people? It depends. Like I look our friend on, I think she has classic style and her nine to five chic, she has had the same style. I would not the same things, but it's you can go back into her archive and it looks like it would still work now. Taylor Tommasi Hill, little funkier. She's not, I used to love her street style more now. You know, she was a business woman, her mom. It's not totally the same. Crystal Bick, I love it's very editorial. She does more of like shoots and not necessarily like, she's walking around New York in these gowns, but I love the time and energy she puts into that. I feel like it depends once you, It's like you have to find someone and then you kind of find people that they follow and that they appreciate and you just kind of expand All the people you mentioned I'll have like a very sort of classic and more timeless Style to them. What about Jamie Beck? Like her at hers is more of like I'm inspired by her photography There's a girl that I started following recently I think it's signed Blake in Chicago her styles really fine I found her through Crystal Vic. Yeah, I follow too many people now. I don't think it's one person specifically. It's just like everyone connected. I feel like I could make a comment and put some Instagram accounts in there. Okay, do that. Yeah. Well, if we, there are a lot of questions that came in and if we actually didn't get to your question this time, it's either because we answered it in a previous video, which you can watch. It's right over there. We're going to be doing more of of these in the future so there are definitely some questions that weren't answered in that first one that we will get to in the next one."

        "transcript": " It's good, but is it that good? Let's discuss. I'm Brian Sacawa, you're watching He Spoke Style, where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. It's rare that I'll do a single fragrance review, but since it is the 10-year anniversary of Creativantus, I thought it was apropos, especially because this fragrance is held in such high regard and is often called one of the best, if not the best, fragrance in the entire world. And that is not an exaggeration. People absolutely love this fragrance. It gets tons of compliments. And I'm sure you're wondering, what is it that makes it so good? Before we get to that, just a few quick bullet points about the history and background of this fragrance. So, introduced in 2010, crafted by Olivier Creed in collaboration with his son Irwin. It was inspired by the life of Napoleon Bonaparte. The name is derived from Ah, which means from, and Ventus, the wind, from the wind, which is an allusion to always being driven and moving forward towards success. And speaking of success, Aventus has become the best selling fragrance in the entire history of Creed, which stretches back all the way to 1760. So obviously what makes a fragrance a blockbuster fragrance is how it smells. And I have to say that Aventus is a very special scent. It's very difficult in my opinion to do something that is unique, but that also appeals to a very, very wide audience. And I think that's especially true when you are dealing with a brand that has a very long history that is by and large a niche brand and a product that is not cheap. 50ml bottle costs $325, 100ml $435, 250ml $670, 500ml $1,055, and a 1,000ml bottle coming in at $1,600. So we'll come to whether or not I think it's worth the price, but now let's actually dive into some of the notes that make Creed of Ventus such an unmistakable scent. On the top you've got bergamot, black currant leaves, apple and pineapple. You know when you spray this immediately you're hit with that freshness and the note that does come through the most is pineapple. Completely unmistakable. It's got that sweetness you're imagining right now but it's not overpowering. It's very balanced with everything around it. Right out of the bottle this pineapple note is what I would say is the number one element that makes Aventus so interesting, different, and unexpected. Of course, there's more to any great fragrance than what you smell right off the bat. Now, as this dries down, it develops in the middle with notes of pinkberries, birch, the woodiness really does start to come through at this stage, and you also have some patchouli and jasmine. As it fully develops, the base notes you get hints of are musk, oak moss, ambergris, and vanilla, with the latter kind of peeking through very distinctively. Overall, I would characterize the scent as slightly sweet, fresh and somewhat woody. Creed on their website calls it a fruity and rich fragrance. Rich, I can kind of get behind. Fruity, I think, is a little bit of mischaracterization. There is definitely that unmistakable pineapple note, but it's not fruity in the way that that suggests. It's definitely a masculine scent that can be worn all year round. And in terms of longevity, it lasts around eight hours on my skin and becomes more or less of a skin scent in the last hour or two. For as many people that love Creed Aventus, the fragrance does have its fair share of haters as well. And a lot of people who are in that camp generally find Aventus unremarkable in terms of how it actually smells and attribute its popularity to the marketing effort that was put behind it. There are also people who I might call fragrance snobs or maybe fragrance hipsters is a better term, who simply don't like it because it is so popular. But you gotta think that it's popular for a reason, right? I mean, a fragrance doesn't get as popular as Aventus if it smells like it. It doesn't matter how much marketing you have behind it. If it doesn't smell good, it's not going to be a winner. So there's definitely something special about Creed Aventus. In a certain way, it's as neutral and boring as like Aqua De Jau or Osovage in that it has that sort of mass appeal to it, but it's also unique in a very inoffensive way, not in a niche fragrance or fragrance nerd kind of way. And that is what I think really gives it the edge in the realm of fragrances that have that universal appeal. What's different, however, and since I mentioned Aqua De Jo and Osovage is the price. So those two, we're in the 80 to $100 range, whereas Aventus, as you saw it and probably know, is upwards of $3 to $400, which begs the question, is Creed Aventus worth it? I can only give you my opinion here, and I definitely encourage you to have a discussion about this in the comments. And in my opinion, Create A Ventus is worth it and deserves a place among the most classic men's fragrances of all time. I didn't include it in my roundup of the top 10 most classic men's fragrances, but that was because it is such a modern scent. If you are a fan of classic fragrances, I definitely recommend you check out that video right over there. See what my favorites are and see if I've got yours on the list."

        "transcript": " The one piece of advice that I really want to give you when it comes to adding essential items to your wardrobe is to not be afraid to invest in quality. You're going to wear and use these pieces a lot and a quality item will just last longer. And in this video, I'm going to be giving you my five fall essentials that are worth the investment. I'm Brian Sakawa. You're watching He Spoke Style, where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well. have more confidence and unlock your potential. Fall Essential number one is a scarf. Now, I know we're talking about investments in this video, but an investment does not necessarily mean that you are spending a ton of money. You might be spending more on a particular item for something like quality, for example, and that is the case here with this scarf. It's by Barber and it costs around $75. It's made from wool woven by Moon exclusively for Barber. It's got that great classic barber plaid, which I think is perfect for the fall season with the very earthy colors. I styled it kind of classic and sporty here with a pea coat, some faded jeans, and a pair of Oxblood leather boots. Fall Essential number two is a stylish coat. This coat I'm wearing here is a new pickup for me. I absolutely love it. It's from a brand called Talia Torre, double breasted, great herringbone pattern. I love the brown color. I picked it up on Farfetch, our sponsor for today's video. Farfetch, I always love checking out because they have a great selection of pieces just like this, which are classic, but also have a little bit of a modern sensibility. There are also a lot of brands that you don't normally find in the US, including this one, Talia Torre. And a lot of times I find that those particular brands have an off the rack fit that I personally prefer. And it's hard to find from a lot of other retailers that you would normally see. This coat is available on Farfetch and I've got a link to it as well as all the pieces I'm featuring in this video down below in the description. If you wanna save 10%, all you have to do is use our code that's HSS10FF at checkout. Fall Essential number three is a pair of suede Oxford shoes. For me, one of the most classic pairs that you can own is in a dark brown suede like I have here. These are actually by a brand called Scoroso. The shoes are made in Italy. I have a couple pairs of boots there also that I really love. There's something about the texture of suede combined with the deep, rich color that really makes these a perfect pair of fall shoes in my mind. They're dressy, but they still have a casual feel about them. Love wearing them with a look like this, just a super classic kind of menswear uniform with the navy double breasted jacket, some gray flannel pants, and deep burgundy striped tie. Fall Essential number four is a nice lux turtleneck. You guys know that I am a big fan of turtleneck sweaters and while I do have several in my collection that I would put in the very affordable category, it's nice to have one that you splurge on that's in a luxe fabric. That is the case here. This turtleneck is by Cornelliani and it's a wool cashmere blend. I've had this sweater for many years and it is one of my absolute favorites. Obviously, I love the color but I also love how it feels and how it makes me feel when when I wear it, which for me is totally worth the extra investment. It really has a way of elevating a more casual look like I've got here with the suede jacket, salvaged jeans, and Chelsea boots. Fall Essential number five is an accessory, and that is a classic Filson Twill briefcase. There are three things I really love about a Filson briefcase. First and foremost is the quality. Invest in one, you'll have it forever. But not only that, because as you use it, it will look better with age. Number two, it's got that kind of in between style, so you can carry it with a look like this, which is dressed up, but also a little dressed down with a barber jacket. And it would not look out of place if you were carrying it while wearing jeans either. Number three, this classic tan color. Perfect for all year round, but I think it looks good especially during the fall. Reminder that this, along with everything featured in this video, is linked down below in the description, and you can save 10% off your next Farfetch purchase with code HSS10FF.

        "transcript": " Wait a second, do I really need this? Does it look good? Are tight clips actually still in style? Good questions and I've got the answers right after this. I'm Brian Sakawa and you're watching He Spoke Style where we are dedicated to giving all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. When Mad Men came out in 2007, it really inspired a resurgence of interest in classic men's style. And one of the things that became a bit of a trend during the show's popularity was the tie clip. Now, although it was sort of on trend during that time to wear a tie clip, tie clips have been around for a long time, and they're really a classic men's accessory. So in this video, I'm going to cover the purpose of a tie clip, different styles of tie clips, proper size, proper placement, what to look for, what to avoid. I'm going to show you one subtle trick to pulling a tie clip off and of course answer the question, are tie clips still in style? So what are tie clips used for? Tie clips are used to keep your tie attached to the placket of your shirt. It keeps it from blowing in the breeze, accidentally dipping into your coffee or your food, just in general to hold it in place. Even though it might seem obvious, it's important that when you're wearing a tie clip that it attaches to both your shirt and your tie. Tie clips come in two styles. You have a pinch clasp and a slide clasp. A pinch clasp I find to be very secure. It works well with thicker ties. The only drawback to a pinch clasp in my opinion is that it doesn't lay as flat and can stick out a little bit when you're wearing one. A slide clasp on the other hand is a little more elegant in terms of how it lays. It's a good option for a tie with a standard thickness. If I had to choose, my personal preference is a slide clasp. In terms of tie clip size or length, it's all about proportion in relation to the width of your tie. A tie clip should never be wider than your tie, and for me, a tie clip about three quarters of the width of your tie is just about perfect. Now the next thing you're probably wondering is where is the right place to position the tie clip? Now as a general rule of thumb, wearing the tie clip between the third and fourth buttons of your shirt, discounting the very top collar button is optimal. Again, in terms of proportions, I think this looks the most pleasing and most natural. If it's too high or too low, as you sometimes see, to my eye at least I feel like it really throws off the balance. A tie bar should be worn perpendicular to your tie like this and not crooked. Now with the caveat that it is perfectly natural and inevitable when you wear a tie clip, that it's going to move now and then. So if you notice it, just put it back in place, but do not stress out or constantly obsess or fuss over this. In terms of color, I think it's helpful to have both a silver tone tie clip and a gold tone tie clip to be able to complement whatever outfit you're wearing, as well as whatever situation you're wearing that outfit in. day-to-day stuff. I typically choose silver and for more formal or elegant evening events, I generally choose gold. Now in terms of style, keep it conservative and avoid novelty tie clips, mustaches, whales. You should be the focus, not your accessories. Here's a little subtle trick to remember when you're wearing a tie clip. Now just before you fasten it, pull your tie upward to blouse it slightly. This will add a little bit of depth and visual appeal. It looks more natural and it will also keep you from feeling constricted or like the tie clip is holding you in place. Whether or not you wear a tie clip is completely up to you. Does it look good with your outfit? Do you feel comfortable wearing it? If you answered yes to those questions, go for it. Now are tie clips still in style? A tie clip is a timeless and classic men's style accessory and as As a result, whether it's on trend or not, it's a stylish flourish that you can add to a dress upload.

        "transcript": " Check this out. Start with a shirt, add a sweater, and then finish it off with a coat. This is layering. It keeps you warm and it looks really good. If you've ever wondered how to layer properly, in this video I'm going to break down some simple rules for nailing it every time and show you five ways to do it. I'm Brian Sacawa. You're watching He Spoke Style, where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. This video is sponsored by Geology. Geology is a skincare regimen for men and three things that I like most about the brand are one, it's not complicated, two, it's quick, the routine takes just two minutes in the morning and two minutes at night, and three, it's tailored specifically for you. So when you go to the website, it takes you through a quick 30 second diagnostic quiz, And then from your answers, geology formulates and curates a series of products designed to give your skin exactly what it needs with no hassle. So you start out with a 30 day trial of four products. Right now I'm using the everyday face wash, the vital morning face cream, the repairing night cream, and the nourishing eye cream. After that 30 day trial, you can continue with 90 day supplies of everything that you love either by subscribing, which is obviously more cost effective, or going a la carte. So I've enjoyed using these products so far and definitely recommend trying them out if you're looking for a quick and easy way to take care of your skin. If you're interested, I have a link and code down below. He spoke 30 that you can use to save 30%, which makes it less than a dollar a day to get started. Let's get started now with our first layering tip. And that is to keep it to three layers max. Two is okay, four too much, it's too complicated and can look bulky. Three layers, pretty much the sweet spot and feels more complete than two, in my opinion. So I started here with just a simple white shirt and then added in a lightweight wool V-neck sweater, which is a great layering piece, works on its own and it's thin enough that you could also layer it under a blazer. Instead of a blazer though, I chose a lightweight wool topcoat and the plaid here pulls in both the gray of the sweater and the blue of the pants. Our next step is to have your layers go from thinnest to thickest. So thin layers inside and thick layers outside. It's kind of something that happens naturally I find when you're getting dressed, but it's always helpful to kind of understand exactly what's going on. I've got the same white shirt from the first look here and I decided to take this outfit in a more sartorial direction with a sleeveless wool cardigan as my middle layer and then the outer layer being this Glen plaid sport coat in a beautiful Fox flannel. Tip number three is to mix up and mix in different patterns and textures. This creates more interest visually. It helps break things up and separate the layers and it helps to create that feeling of depth. In this look, I've got both pattern and texture starting with the brown gingham shirt as my base layer. Softer texture with the middle layer. It's a cashmere long sleeve polo. It's by Luca Filoni. and then some texture with the quilted barber vest. I decided to wear more of a dress pant here, but you could easily swap out those for dark jeans for something a little more casual and a little more rugged. Tip number four is kind of geared towards being ready for any situation, and that is to make sure that in addition to working together and being super complementary to each other, that every layer should also work on its own. Like when I go inside, I'm not going to be wearing the suede jacket. I'm gonna take it off. So I wanna make sure that the waistcoat and the shirt look good on their own. And maybe, maybe I eat too much and the waistcoat just gets a little too tight. So if I take that off, I've still got a great looking shirt and an outfit that also looks put together. As I mentioned at the top of this video, layering is both practical and aesthetic. And you can kind of use that to leverage your approach to really reflect your personal style. Personally, I really like combining more casual and sporty items like the denim jacket here with pieces that are more elevated, such as the turtleneck and the top coat. I talked a little bit about mixing patterns in the third look, and if you're looking for some really easy rules and guidelines for mixing patterns properly, brush up with that video right over there. You know, whether it's layering or putting together shirt and tie combos, I know that this video will help you out."

        "transcript": " If you're going to spend the money on a nice bottle of cologne like this, the one thing you want to know is that it is going to last. Now, some fragrances do last longer than others, but there are some simple things that you can do to help you get the most out of every single bottle. And in this video, I'm going to share five hacks to help you make your cologne last longer. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. So talking about when to apply your cologne is a great place to start. Now you might think that you'd want to wait until the very last moment before walking out of the house to spray it on, less time for it to disappear before seeing the people that you are going to see, which is a totally logical assumption and is also totally wrong. The best time to apply your cologne is after you shower. Your pores are open, the fragrance will seep in a little bit and give you a longer lasting aroma. Now, that will definitely work and it will work even better if you do this one simple thing that is actually something you should be doing already to take care of your skin, and that is to moisturize. So think of it this way. If you've ever had a houseplant that you've forgotten to water, when you go to water it, the water just kind of seeps right through. If your skin is dry like that, a similar thing happens. The cologne is not going to absorb as efficiently, and it will evaporate off you faster. If your skin is properly moisturized, however, it's going to help lock in that fragrance and make it last longer. Next I'm gonna tell you to do something that is the complete opposite of everything you've ever heard about where to apply cologne. Now if you search for this topic, you're going to hear the same thing over and over and over again, and that is to apply cologne on your pulse points, your wrist, behind your ear, bottom of your neck, inside of your elbow. The reasoning is that these areas are warmer than the rest of your body, which helps the fragrance develop and project more strongly. That's correct, but the heat can also contribute to it wearing off faster. So apply to a pulse point, but then spray it somewhere else on your body that doesn't get as hot like your forearm, your shoulder, or back of your neck. Now our next hack to make your cologne last longer is something you might have heard about before, but we're gonna talk about it in a little bit of a different way. I'm talking about layering your fragrances. Typically, that means combining two or three different fragrances, but layering here means literally to layer one fragrance in the same way you would approach layering your clothing. So start with your regular spray after your shower, making sure your skin's moisturized. Then as you're getting dressed, maybe a mist on your undershirt and then maybe on the inside of your jacket as well. This kind of application in multiple places will definitely help prolong your fragrance's life. With that layering technique, there's another place to spray your cologne, not on your body, that will help it last longer, and that is on your comb. So after your shower, after your moisturize, after you spray on that pulse point, before you comb your hair, little mist on the comb, not a close spray, comb your hair, and you've got that little extra kick right there. Now what makes some fragrances stronger and longer lasting than others? Well, one thing is the concentration. Now in general, you've got two different concentrations, Oda Toilette and Oda Parfum. Oda Parfum being much more concentrated and therefore typically much longer lasting. However, a lot of the most famous, most iconic and classic men's fragrances are in an Oda Toilette concentration. So a stronger concentration doesn't necessarily mean that it's a better fragrance. If you want to see some of the best classic men's fragrances, keep watching with that video right over there. 10 picks that always smell great."

        "transcript": " I feel like this first look here is a really great encapsulation of how I like to dress casually and combine maybe you might call them slightly elevated pieces with more rugged casual staples. This vest was a birthday gift from Robin. It's the Lowerdale by Barber. I absolutely love it and it's not the last time you'll see it in this video. Turtle neck is by Peony Parma. Jeans are by Jay crew in a 484 fit. I've got my Speedmaster on the wrist and the Oxblood leather boots are by Bostonian, super stylish and very comfortable. Super casual here for look two. It's not often that you'll see me in athleisure but staying at home and walking the dog and playing with her you know it's got to be all about comfort. So this is pretty much a full-on Lulu lemon look. The jacket is their warp light jacket in a really nice burgundy color. Very lightweight, perfect for this time of year. Underneath I have the vent tech short sleeve shirt. Pants are the ABC joggers in a 28 inch inseam so they sit just above my ankle. The hat is by Vilbrekenn. Data graph on the wrist and Koyo sneakers anchoring this look. Look three I've got on a barber waxed jacket. The model is the Ashby and And I like this one because it has a tailored fit. Underneath, I've got a Buffalo check shirt by Uniqlo. Dark Selvage Jeans by double RL. And this look was for a cooler day, so I took a scarf that I have from Drake. It's actually a really short silk scarf. And tucked that into the shirt just to keep my neck a little warmer. I'm wearing a Tweed Newsboy cap by Goran Brothers, Speedmaster on the wrist, and Bostonian boots again. Another favorite fall look of mine. I've kind of been all about the flannel shirts so far this fall. I just had wood delivered and stacked it so I'm kind of feeling that lumberjack vibe. The shirt is actually really old and it's from a brand called Howe, which I don't think exists anymore, but I really love the color combination of the plaid. It's a great shirt to layer the barber vest over. Again, I'm wearing the faded J Crew jeans, datagraph on the wrist, and Koyo sneakers to finish it off. For look 5 we've got a suede trucker jacket by Reese. I posted an old photo of this on Instagram last week and someone said that it was available but I didn't see this particular color on the website so happy hunting if you're looking for it. The cool sweater I've worn a couple times I think in videos is by Boss. Black jeans are Levi's 511's. Got the datagraph on the wrist. of sneakers again to give an element of contrast to the rest of the look. This is probably like the most casual you will ever see me on this channel. Very much just hanging out around the house, doing stuff in the yard kind of look. This wool shirt jacket is believe it or not by H&M. It's like seven years old and just seems to keep getting better and never wears out. And then I've got just a simple baseball shirt underneath, J. Crew Jeans, IWC Ongenar on the wrist and my favorite Koyo sneakers. I love this kind of moss green colored jacket. It's also by Lulu Lemon, but it's heavier than the jacket I wore in Look 2, so perfect for days when it's a little bit cooler. I've got a Lulu Lemon shirt underneath and the sweats are by Uniqlo. I know I've worn these Koyos a lot in this video. I just find them so easy to style. Lots of casual looks here, but if you are looking for some more ways to style white leather sneakers like this, check out that video right over there. They're all fall looks, so perfect for the season."

        "transcript": " I'm going to buy an Omega Speedmaster right now. I'll talk about why I decided on this particular watch later on in the video. And I know a lot of you have been looking forward to a watch collection update. That is coming. Just consider this a little bit of a sneak preview. All right, so I am going to actually be buying this watch on eBay. So I'm going to their authentic watch page. And I will search for the Omega Speedmaster. Now full disclosure, I have looked at a couple of these watches already as you can see. This one right here looked really promising to me. I like the price, but I decided against this particular watch because it only had the box and warranty. Now the other one over here does have box and papers and you could argue either way whether that's important to you or not. For me, it is something that I would like and worth paying a little bit extra for, so I don't mind that. So, 100%, this is the watch I want. I'm going to go ahead and buy it, and here we go. I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. Alright, I can't wait any longer. Let's unbox this watch. And And here it is, right on my wrist. You know, I've always loved the Speedmaster. I love the look of it. I love the history of the watch. And many of you asked after my first watch collection video why I didn't have one in my collection already. That's a fair question because it is such a classic watch and it really does fit my style. So there are actually two big reasons why I never thought that I would be a Speedmaster owner myself. And the first of those is practical and it has to do with the case size. I have a wrist that is on the smaller side. It's six and a half inches and speedmasters are generally 42 millimeters, which for me is just a little too big for my wrist. I feel most comfortable with watch that is 40 millimeters or less, which this speedmaster, the first Omega in space is. It's actually a 39.7 millimeter case. So just under 40 millimeters and as a result it sits really well on my wrist as you can see. Now we'll get into the historical component of this watch but as a quick sidebar it is based on the famous CK2998 and there is another Speedmaster limited edition also based on the CK2998. Also 39.7 millimeters Panda dial. There was one in the boutique in Las Vegas when I was out there. I tried it on. it and I wish that I had bought that one too. So the second reason I never thought I would own a Speedmaster is that I've always just been completely overwhelmed with the history of this watch. There are so many different versions, there's just so much to learn and know. It was just a rabbit hole that I really wasn't ready to go down. Of course that's changed now and because I do like to know as much as possible about every watch that I own and wear and love, I did get this awesome ridiculously comprehensive book, which I am slowly making my way through. So I finally decided to take that giant leap, sorry for the space pun, and add a Speedmaster to my collection because it totally fits my style. This version, the first Omega in space, fits my wrist. And it's a watch that has an amazing history. So now that you know that story, let's actually take a closer look at this particular watch and talk about the similarities and differences between this model and the original CK2998. Alright so here it is, stainless steel case which is, as mentioned, 39.7mm, rimmed by a tachometer scale, scratch resistant sapphire crystal, varnished black dial, leaf shaped hour and minute hands along with the central chronograph hand. At 3 o'clock, the chronograph 30 minute recorder, six o'clock, the chronograph 12 hour recorder, and then at nine o'clock, we have a small second style. One really nice detail on the dial is the applied omega logo, which is a nod to earlier Speed Masters, which would have that as well. Chronograph pushers are at 2 and 4 o'clock. It comes on a brown leather strap. On the caseback, you have the original execution of the Omega hippocampus. The words first omega in space, the date October 3, 1962, signifying when Walter Shearer wore the 2998 in space. And then the number of this particular watch, it's not a limited edition, it's a numbered edition. And finally inside, this watch is powered by the caliber 1861. So this watch is inspired by the famous CK 2998, which was worn by astronaut Walter Shearer as he orbited the Earth during the Sigma 7 mission. There are a lot of similarities between the two watches including the straight lugs but there are a few differences that are worth pointing out. The first of those being the shape of the hand in the small second style. In Shira's original 2998 it was baton shaped which matched the chronograph registers but in the first omega in space you can see that it is leaf shaped. I kind of like that because I think it helps distinguish the small seconds register from the chronograph registers, and aligns it more with the hour and minute hands which are also leaf-shaped. The second difference is one you can't actually see, it's internal. The CK2998 was powered by the caliber 321, whereas the first Omega in space, the more recent 1861. And then finally, the caseback, obviously very different. I really like like what my friend Arthur Tuchot said about this watch compared to the 2998. And that was that since the odds of going to space are actually better than finding an affordable and original reference 2998, the first Omega in space is a great alternative. It's an affordable, manually wound chronograph with an amazing history. It fits really well into my collection and I know a lot of you are looking forward to an updated watch collection video. That is coming soon, I guarantee it. In the meantime, I encourage you to re-watch my first collection video and place some bets on what watches are gone and what watches are new to the collection."

        "transcript": " This video is all about the color brown. We've got a brown suit, brown jackets, brown shirt, brown tie, brown shoes, brown boots. And I'm going to put them together into five brown monochromatic outfits from business to casual right after this. [\"Bloodline\"] I'm Brian Sakawa and you are watching He Spoke Style where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge, and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence, and unlock your potential. So this first look I kind of consider a summer to fall transition look, and that is 100% because of the jacket and specifically the fabric. It's linen, but it's a heavier linen, so that coupled with the fact that it is a darker color, I think makes it totally work in this situation. Whenever I put together monochromatic outfits, One of my favorite strategies is to think about using different shades of that particular color. So we've got the dark brown of the jacket, the lighter khaki in the pants, and then in the middle we've got the shoes, the belt, and the watch strap. Also threw in some pattern with a gingham shirt to break up the solids and provide a focal point for the outfit. I really consider a brown suit to be my alternate navy suit. Suits are extremely versatile and both suits allow you to pair lots of different colors with them which admittedly we don't really care about here because we're dealing with a monochromatic look. Now the point I'm going to keep making is that when you're dealing with just one color you've always got to do something to create some contrast. Since we've got a solid suit and a solid shirt I went with a striped tie. It gives it a really classic business feel and because of the dark brown color of the suit I would say that this outfit would also work really well for some type of dressier evening event. The piece of clothing I wanted more than anything when I was a grad student was a brown tweed blazer. I never got around to getting one back then but it was the very first thing I had made for me at Michael Andrews Bespoke about seven years ago. I like how it's sporty and refined at the same time and has a bit of a professorial vibe especially with the suede elbow patches that I have here. And as you can see this jacket is what I want to call attention to with this outfit. The darker brown turtleneck also feels kind of professorial to me in this setting. Tassel loafers give a relaxed feel and then finished off with the Vacheron traditionale. Different take on the suit here. This time I'm swapping out the shirt and tie for a turtleneck which I always feel is a great way to give a suit a bit of elegance and casual sophistication. This kind of look is something that I absolutely love this time of year, especially for an evening event. Since the suit is darker, I went with a lighter tan turtleneck to again create that contrast and give the look a bit of depth. You'll notice that I'm not wearing a pocket square. I wanted to keep it as minimal and chic as possible. Now I like to wear glasses sometimes for evening events. These are by Persol, JLC Reverso on the wrist, super elegant, and then finished off with a pair of double monks with the gold buckle pulling in the watch metal. Okay, I am cheating a little bit here with this look. Those are black jeans, but I just love how they pair with this jacket. It's a suede trucker jacket. Will be available in our Michael Andrews collection, which I will add is not far off from launching. I paired that with with the same turtleneck from Look 3. More contrast down below with the Chelsea boots and then a really cool pair of sunglasses which are by Moss God. I love how when you dress monochromatically, it can really work from casual like this all the way to business. And it's something that's really easy to do with navy as well. I did five all navy looks in a previous video which is right over there. So click there and learn how to make a big statement with less."

You go to that in-between dress code that we call smart casual. And in this video, five simple, easy, and stylish smart casual outfit ideas for fall. I'm Brian Zacaua and you are watching He Spoke Style where we are dedicated to giving you all the tips, knowledge and inspiration you need to dress well, have more confidence and unlock your potential. Alright, for our first look here we're just going to keep it super simple and super classic. Navy chinos, white shirt, classic combo. And then the light gray flannel sport coat giving it some polish and seasonal vibes. So I have to be honest and say that this look is so easy to pull off that it's one that's easy for me to forget about when I'm thinking about what to wear. But what it reminds me of when I see it is that you really can never go wrong with those simple menswear basics in a classic color palette. And then I'm adding in some brown accents with the belt and the loafers, great smart casual shoe option. And on my wrist is the Cartier Tank American. Taking the same pair of pants and navy chinos from the last outfit and changing up the top for a sportier and more earthy vibe. A chambray shirt I love all year round but especially during the fall. I think the fabric and the texture mesh really well with the season. Same goes for the jacket which is in a brown Donagall tweed. I'm so happy that the weather is finally getting cooler and I can pull this out again. It's one of my favorite fall jackets. Love the suede elbow patch detail. Pocket square contrasts a little bit, but also pulls in the blue of the shirt and pants. And then the leather strap of the watch, tying together with the shoes, which are by Enzo Bonafé. All right, raise your hand if you have been waiting to see a blazer with jeans outfit on this channel. It's not something I do all the time, but sometimes it just works, depending on the situation. I think it's important that if you are going to do this look that you do pay attention to a couple things. Number one, dark denim always looks best in my opinion. And number two, your jacket should have either a texture like the tweed jacket from the last outfit or a pattern like we have here with the gun club check. Those types of elements help to kind of bridge that gap so you don't have a disconnect between the jacket as the dressy element and the jeans as the casual. Another blazer with jeans outfit here and although we don't have a big pattern or texture like a tweed, what we do have is a flannel fabric which also works well with jeans because of the weight of the fabric and it's just overall more organic look and feel. I layered in a v-neck sweater here in a light gray and you can see the progression of color going from the dark gray jacket to the lighter gray sweater and finally to the white of the shirt which focuses your attention and frames up my face. of the jeans, I wanted to give this look a little more of a rugged feel. So I added in a felt fedora and finished it off with a pair of leather dress boots. Going for something lighter and more chic with this outfit here, you know, we tend to think of white pants as more of a summer style move. But what I like about wearing them in the fall and winter is that they're unexpected and it makes a fall or a winter outfit with them just seem really fresh. I wanted to keep a light and organic feel with this outfit that was in line with the season, which is why I chose a light gray flannel jacket and the light tan turtleneck. Now I know a lot of you like me are really looking forward to the colder weather to start wearing those turtlenecks again and I've got a video right over there with 10 different turtleneck outfits you can try. It's kind of a different style than this one, so click over there, check it out and let me know what you think."
